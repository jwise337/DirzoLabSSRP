AB A severe drought in northern Arizona caused widespread pinyon (Pinus edulis) mortality, exceeding 40% in some populations. We measured tree-ring widths of pinyons that survived and that died in three sites designated as "high," "medium," and "low" stress. Growth characteristics during the previous 10-15 years can be used to predict the likelihood of drought-induced death; dead trees exhibited 1.5 times greater variation in growth than live trees. A model of ring-width deviations vs. drought severity showed a loss of "climatic sensitivity" with age in dead trees. These differences were independent of site. We found two distinct tree types that are predisposed to die during drought; highly sensitive young trees, and insensitive older trees. As the Southwest has a dynamic climate typified by severe droughts, it is important to understand how droughts act as bottleneck events to affect a dominant tree in a major vegetation type of the United States.

AB Some natural ecosystems near industrialized and agricultural areas receive atmospheric nitrogen inputs that are an order of magnitude greater than those presumed for preindustrial rimes. Because nitrogen (N) often limits microbial growth on dead vegetation, increased N input can be expected to affect the ecosystem process of decomposition. We found that extracellular enzyme responses of a forest-floor microbial community to chronically applied aqueous NH4NO3 can explain both increased and decreased litter decomposition rates caused by added N. Microbes responded to N by increasing cellulase activity in decaying leaf litter of flowering dogwood, red maple, and red oak, but in high-lignin oak litter, the activity of lignin-degrading phenol oxidase declined substantially. We believe this is the first report of reduced ligninolytic enzyme activity caused by chronic N addition in an ecosystem. This result provides evidence that ligninolytic enzyme suppression can be an important mechanism explaining decreased decay rates of plant matter seen in this and other N-addition experiments. Since lignin and cellulose are the two most abundant organic resources on earth, these altered enzyme responses signal that atmospheric N deposition may be affecting the global carbon cycle by influencing the activities of microbes and their carbon-acquiring enzymes-especially the unique ligninolytic enzymes produced by white-rot fungi-over broad geographic areas.

   EXPERIMENT
AB We studied the effects of heavy and prolonged rainfall associated with four El Nino events on the reproduction of Darwin's finches on the Galapagos island of Daphne Major. Rainfall varied in the El Nino years from 195 mm to 1359 mm, exceeding the maximum in the other years by 40% to 1000%. Two species were studied: Geospiza fortis, Medium Ground Finch, and G. scandens, Cactus Finch. Almost all eggs, nestlings, and fledglings produced by banded females were recorded in the El Nino years of 1983, 1987, 1991, and 1998. Finch production in these years was compared with production in 10 other years of breeding in the period 1976-1990; there was no breeding in three drought years, 1985, 1988, and 1989.
   Breeding differed in the two sets of years in several ways. More broods were produced in El Nino years than in non-El Nino years (maximum 10 clutches per female vs. five clutches), the period of breeding was longer (maximum eight months vs. four), average clutch sizes (range 2-6 eggs) were distinctly larger (four vs. three), and average egg and fledgling production per female was larger by a factor of four. The two species differed in some features of breeding, but differences were minor in comparison with the marked seasonal and annual variation. Finch production varied among El Nino years, being greatest in the year of most rain over the longest period (1983), and least in the next wettest year (1998). The surprisingly low production in 1998 is attributed in part to interactions with other finches, and in part to exceptionally high temperatures. Temperature, although postively correlated with rainfall, had an independent negative effect upon hatching and overall breeding success of G. fortis. Breeding by both species in the year of birth (hatch) occurred in two El Nino years with the most extended wet seasons: 1983 and 1987. Young breeders had lower clutch sizes and breeding success than did contemporaneously breeding older birds.
   Observations in different El Nino years show that finch population responses to major climatic perturbations such as elevated rainfall vary for two major reasons: the perturbations themselves vary in strength and duration, and responses to them are determined, in part, by preceding conditions. Those preceding conditions, in turn, are determined by whether drought or normal conditions precede the perturbation, and on the interval since the previous El Nino event. Thus, perturbations of natural systems can be fully understood only in a broad temporal context.

AB We are concerned with the climatic factors that affect the adaptive radiation of species into and within the temperate zone. As one progresses northward, there is a decrease in summer temperatures and a concomitant increase in the duration and intensity of winter cold. For the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, it has been shown previously that (1) range expansion and evolution has proceeded from south to north, and (2) either realistically hot summer temperatures or a simulated 7-mo winter reduce fitness by 60% or more in two New Jersey (40 degrees N) populations. Herein, we compare the relative fitness of nine populations of W. smithii from 30 degrees to 50 degrees N when exposed to these same stressful summer temperatures and simulated winter. We determined the survivorship, fecundity, and fertility of five cohorts from each population at each temperature in both environments, and we calculated the cohort replacement rate (R(0)) as the product of these three component traits. Survivorship declined with increasing latitude in the summer, but not the winter, environment. Fecundity was not correlated with latitude in either environment. Fertility declined with increasing latitude in both environments. R(0) was not correlated with latitude in either environment. Hence, the interpretation of the adaptive responses to climate can depend critically on the trait being examined. Because R(0) is a composite index of fitness that includes any trade-offs among its constituent traits, we place greater reliance on its noncorrelation with latitude. Therefore, we conclude that, despite their clear impact on fitness, summer heat and winter cold have had little impact on the adaptive evolution of W. smithii to the climatic gradient of North America. The decline in summer heat and increase in the duration and intensity of winter cold as one moves north also impose a latitudinal gradient in the length of the favorable growing season. Many plants and animals use daylength to cue the seasonal events in their life cycles. We then argue that the timing of seasonal development mediated by photoperiodic response constitutes the most immediate adaptation of populations to novel temperate climates, and that adaptation of thermal responsiveness to summer heat or winter cold takes place over a longer time scale or taxonomic distance.

AB Variation in the ability to utilize pulses of both water and nitrogen (N) is one possible mechanism allowing the coexistence of species in the cold desert community on the Colorado Plateau. We simulated 25-mm precipitation events and used stable isotope tracers (H-2 and N-15) to follow water and N uptake patterns in six dominant perennials (Artemisia filifolia, Coleogyne ramosissima, Cryptantha flava, Ephedra viridis, Quercus havardii, and Vanclevea stylosa) at different times of the growing season. Water pulse utilization varied on a seasonal basis and was to some extent different among species during the summer. Carbon isotope discrimination was negatively related to both plant use of moisture in upper soil layers and foliar N concentration. Species that were similar in water pulse utilization patterns differed in the natural abundances of N-15, suggesting partitioning in N sources. All species were able to utilize N pulses after rain events, but there were temporal differences in the responses among species. We also found that water and N uptake in shallow roots do not necessarily occur simultaneously. Artemisia, Cryptantha, and Quercus showed significant uptake of both water and N from the upper soil layers. In contrast, Coleogyne and Ephedra showed the capacity to utilize the water pulse, but not the N pulse. Vanclevea only took up N. The results indicate that different parts of the root system may be responsible for the acquisition of water and N. Our results also suggest that N and water partitioning could contribute to the coexistence of species in highly variable environments such as the Colorado Plateau desert system.

AB To examine rates of aboveground biomass accumulation (ABA) in global secondary forests following stand-clearing disturbances, we compiled aboveground biomass data from 283 known-age plots drawn from chronosequence and long-term studies. We focused on three likely influences on ABA for which data are readily available. climate, soil texture, and forest type. Growing-season degree-years (GSDY, stand age x growing-season length x growing-season temperature) generally predicted ABA better than stand age alone. Using regression analyses and slope homogeneity tests, we determined that broadleaf forest plots on sandy textured soils exhibited slower GSDY-adjusted ABA than those on nonsandy soils. On nonsandy soils, the GSDY-adjusted ABAs of tropical and nontropical plots were indistinguishable; tropical forest post-disturbance ABA was not particularly slow. Compared to broadleaf forests, needle-leaf forest, GSDY-adjusted ABA was less sensitive to soil texture and was intermediate in rate between sandy and nonsandy broadleaf forest ABA. Foliar nutrient concentration did not significantly influence the GSDY-adjusted ABA of a subset of the nonsandy broadleaf forests for which foliar nutrient data were available. At the global scale, differences in climate (represented by growing-season length and temperature) and moisture-holding capacity (represented by soil texture) are the principal independent factors influencing ABA in most post-disturbance secondary forests.

AB Oribatid mites (Acari: Oribatidae) are the most diverse arthropod group in forest titter and soil, and they make significant contributions to decomposition as microbial grazers and saprophages. As is true for all the hyperdiverse soil taxa, the determinants of their diversity and species composition are virtually unexplored. This experiment tests whether heterogeneity of the litter habitat is a determinant of their local diversity, and whether litter composition is a determinant of their species composition. At a single site of temperate deciduous forest at the Coweeta Hydrological Laboratory in the mountains of North Carolina, USA, natural litterfall was excluded from a series of 42 1-m(2) plots and, for three consecutive years, replaced with treatment litters that varied in their composition and complexity. Plots of pure yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and red oak (Quercus rubra) litter comprised the monotypic or simple litter treatments. Two complex litters included a mixture of these three litter species and a mixture of seven litter species with pieces of small woody debris.
   Monotypic litters developed profiles of reduced thickness that contained lower numbers of invading roots and less humic and arthropod fecal material. Over 3 yr, oribatid abundance and richness declined substantially and to a similar degree in all simple litter treatments, though the dominant species, Oppiella nova, was unaffected by litter simplification. Similarity of species composition increased markedly among replicates within each litter treatment for two sectors of the assemblage: the large, litter-dwelling species and the endophagous and wood-associated species. Species composition among small litter-dwellers was unresponsive to litter type.
   Several characteristics of monotypic-litter habitats potentially contributed to the erosion of the oribatid assemblage. Loss of structure in monotypic litter likely led to reduced and less hospitable physical living space. It appeared to reduce recruitment of roots and retention of humic and fecal material in the litter layer. Each monotypic litter contained only a subset of the structural microhabitats that serve as refugia for eggs and juveniles. Finally, the synchronized decomposition of uniform substrates could have led to a "boom-bust" economy in microbial resources that was unfavorable to oribatid mites and their conservative life histories.

AB Brown hares (Lepus europaeus) are shown to facilitate grazing by Brent Geese (Branta bernicla) in a temperate salt marsh in the Netherlands by retarding vegetation succession for >25 yr. Winter grazing by hares prevented the shrub Atriplex portulacoides from spreading in younger parts nf thp salt marsh. Clipping experiments showed that Atriplex had poor recovery after removal of aboveground tissue, which makes Atriplex vulnerable for hare attack. Once Atriplex swards were cut to the ground to mimic hare grazing, Brent Geese visited those sites more than twice as frequently than untouched control plots. Goose visitation was reduced when bushes of Atriplex were planted. Large parts of the core feeding area of Brent Geese would be unsuitable for goose grazing if hares were not present. A reduction of at least 44% in the carrying capacity of the marsh for Brent Geese was calculated in the absence of hares. Vulnerability of Atriplex to hare grazing and the high food intake of geese are key elements to this facilitative pattern. Additionally, hares reduced the number of dead Artemisia maritima stems in grassy swards, which otherwise might have hampered grazing by geese. Facilitation by herbivores such as hare, rabbit, cattle, and sheep is likely to be a prominent factor enhancing feeding conditions for Brent Geese all along the northwest European coast.

AB The pace and magnitude of long-term change in the forests of eastern North America is poorly understood. The current study examines the developmental history of primary Tsuga canadensis stands in central Massachusetts from before European settlement to the present. Through an integrated reconstructive approach employing stand-level pollen stratigraphies, tree ring chronologies, and long-term archival records, we show how the characteristic structure and composition of old-growth forests in southern New England developed in four stands through a history of anthropogenic and natural disturbance, rather than through the gradual process of autogenic succession. Forest composition during presettlement times was distinct at each site and included a variety of successional stages ranging from late-successional northern hardwood-Tsuga assemblages to assemblages dominated by early successional to mid-successional taxa such as Castanea, Quercus, and Pinus. Anthropogenic disturbance during the 18th and 19th centuries resulted in novel assemblages dominated by Castanea or Betula. Composition at the four sites converged on the current assemblage dominated by large, late-successional Tsuga, in response to altered patterns of disturbance in the 20th century. The age of the dominant trees (100-200 yr) and apparent stability of the current forests masks the extent to which their origin is a product of the cultural landscape and is in no way representative of pre-European forests at these sites.

AB Inbreeding in local host populations will be a common phenomenon in host-pathogen systems that are characterized by metapopulation dynamics, i.e., frequent extinction and recolonization of local host populations by small numbers of founding individuals. As an example of a pathosystem with metapopulation dynamics we investigated the impact of inbreeding in the host plant Silene alba on its interaction with the anther-smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum. Seeds from eight populations of S. alba were sampled, and five generations of sib mating resulted in 65 inbred lines, with inbreeding coefficients of f = 0, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, and 0.59 per line. In a first experiment these lines were tested for active, biochemical resistance against fungal infection, by artificially inoculating individuals. The percentage of infected individuals differed significantly among populations, lines, and inbreeding levels, and both population-by-inbreeding level and line-by-inbreeding level interactions were significant. The most striking result was the strong variance in inbreeding effects among lines; inbreeding resulted in increased resistance in some lines and decreased resistance in others. In a second experiment for 12 inbred lines, originating from one population, active resistance and Rower traits associated with passive resistance (avoidance) to this insect-vectored, florally transmitted disease were measured. Significant inbreeding depression was demonstrated for petal size and nectar volume. Thus inbreeding might enhance avoidance of spore transmission by insects. For both active resistance and all flower traits, significant line-by-inbreeding level interactions were found. The results indicate that the effect of inbreeding on the interaction between host and pathogen in this pathosystem is unpredictable at the local population level, because: (1) strong genotypic differences in inbreeding effect exist for both active and passive resistance, making the effect of inbreeding at the population level dependent on the genotypic composition of the (founder) population (2) effects of inbreeding on active and passive resistance were not correlated, making the net effect of inbreeding on field resistance unpredictable: and (3) in several lines, evidence for epistatic effects was round, making the effect of inbreeding dependent on the actual inbreeding level of the genotype. The results underscore that most progress in the study of host-path from an integrated ecological and genetic approach.

AB Many species experience periodic mortality events, often in the form of winter, yet there is little understanding of how periodic mortality may affect population dynamics. We investigate the effects of periodic mortality on the population dynamics of a predator and its prey, both of which have multiple generations between mortality events. Using the simplest possible model of predator-prey interactions, we show that periodic mortality may produce complex dynamics including alternative stable cycles. Periodic mortality events may also create predator-prey cycles that rotate backwards, with prey densities lagged behind predator densities. The addition of random environmental variability to the model demonstrates that periodic mortality can be a strong driver of population variability, with the vestiges of deterministic cycles taking the form of eruptive patterns in the long-term dynamics of the predator-prey system. These results show that the longterm population dynamics of systems experiencing regular episodes of mortality may exhibit a wealth of patterns not seen in the absence of periodic mortality events.

AB The dispersal ability of seeds, spores, and larvae can greatly influence spatial heterogeneity in the abundance of plants and sedentary animals, especially after a severe and widespread disturbance has caused extensive population declines and opened large areas for colonization by propagules. However, little work has been done on the relationship between propagule dispersal and spatial heterogeneity in species abundance. We hypothesize that, shortly after a disturbance, spatial variability in abundance of sedentary organisms is negatively related to the dispersal potential of a species' propagules, and that this negative relationship diminishes over time as populations recover from the disturbance. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examined temporal changes in spatial patterns of abundance in a diverse group of sedentary marine organisms, whose propagules differ greatly in dispersal potential. The data set was derived from long-term monitoring of the kelp forest communities of Channel Islands National Park and contained annual estimates of abundance of 27 species from nine phyla collected at 16 sites on five different islands during 1986-1994. Among-site variability in the abundance of plants and animals was negatively related to the plank tonic duration of a species' propagules. The negative relationship disappeared over time in some regions, but not in others. This disappearance resulted primarily from species with relatively limited dispersal becoming more uniformly distributed over time; among-site variability of species with more widespread dispersal changed little. Differences among regions in the rate at which the negative relationship diminished over time suggested regional differences in rates of recovery from the 1982-1984 El Nino disturbance. These differences among regions may have resulted in part from differences in the frequency and intensity of sea urchin grazing, and in part from regional differences in the distances separating sites where abundances were measured. Our findings support the hypothesis that differential dispersal after large disturbances can significantly influence spatial heterogeneity in assemblages of sedentary organisms.

AB To determine whether plant genotype can affect long-term herbivore population dynamics, we used a density manipulation experiment to compare the dynamics of Mexican bean beetle populations living on four genotypes of soybeans. Five densities of beetle populations were created on each plant genotype. Each combination of density and genotype was replicated four times, yielding 80 experimental beetle populations. Populations were initiated by releasing adult beetles into 2.25 m(2) cages filled with soybeans and located in a small soybean field. Beetle populations were censused weekly for one generation. Recruitment curves for beetle populations on each soybean genotype were plotted by fitting a Picker model to the data using likelihood methods. The recruitment curves for all genotypes were significantly different from the curves for all other genotypes. The equilibrium beetle density predicted from the curves varied among genotypes by nearly twofold, and the predicted dynamics were fluctuating for all genotypes, with the period of fluctuations differing among genotypes. Performance of beetles also differed among genotypes, suggesting that these genotypes vary in some aspect of their quality as hosts for the beetles. These results indicate that differences in quality among genotypes have the potential to affect long-term herbivore dynamics.

AB Trade-offs in fitness on different host plants has been a central hypothesis in explaining the evolutionary specialization of herbivores. Surprisingly, only a few studies have documented such trade-offs. In this paper, I present results from a selection experiment that demonstrates trade-offs in host plant use for a polyphagous spider mite. Although adaptation to a novel poor-quality host did not result in detectable costs on a favorable host, spider mites that had adapted to a poor-quality host lost their ability to tolerate the poor-quality host when they were reverted to the favorable host for several generations. Trade-offs in fitness on alternative hosts among herbivorous spider mites remains one of the classic empirical examples of constraints on the evolution of host range.
   Adaptation to the novel poor-quality host was not associated with adaptation to a related host-plant species or to particular host-plant chemicals that I assayed. Thus, the complexity of host-plant defenses may restrict host shifts to single species of novel host plants, and adaptive zone shifts onto entire groups of plants predicted by the Ehrlich and Raven Model may be rare. Spider mite performance was genetically associated with host-plant preference. Mites from the control population showed a significant preference for the favorable host plant, whereas mites adapted to the novel host plant showed no preference. Finally, although induced plant responses to herbivory in the poor-quality host decreased the fitness of unselected mites, induced responses resulted in higher fitness of adapted mites. These results suggest that spider mites that rapidly adapt to particular host plants can overcome constitutive and inducible plant defenses.

AB Acarodomatia are small structures found on the underside of the leaves of many woody plant species. Several taxa of nonphytophagous mites are frequently associated with these small tufts of hair or invaginations of the leaf surface. Botanists, and more recently ecologists, have hypothesized that these structures mediate a mutualistic association between the plants and predaceous and microbivorous (microbe-feeding) mites. We examined the influence of domatia on the abundance of a tydeid mite, Orthotydeus lambi, on the riverbank grape, Vitis riparia, and its impact on a key fungal pathogen, grape powdery mildew, Uncinula necator. In two field experiments, we manipulated domatia (by blocking them with glue or using clones that varied in domatia size) and O. lambi densities on V. riparia vines that we had inoculated with mildew. Mite densities were significantly higher on plants with intact domatia than on plants with blocked domatia (38% and 200% greater in experiments 1 and 2, respectively). In addition, clones with larger domatia had significantly more mites than clones with smaller domatia. In the first experiment, the greater number of mites on plants with domatia relative to plants without domatia did not translate into reduced incidence of mildew; mites reduced mildew to very low levels in both treatments. In the second experiment, plants with intact domatia had a significant 38% reduction in leaf area covered with mildew relative to plants with blocked domatia. In addition, clones with larger domatia (and thus more O. lambi) had less mildew than clones with smaller domatia. This study represents the first experimental evidence that acarodomatia benefit plants through increased abundance of a mycophagous mite, which resulted in decreased severity of a plant disease.

AB To evaluate the relative roles of seed availability and competitive interactions in creating within-community patterns of species richness in unproductive grassland, we conducted a sowing experiment in a dry calcareous (alvar) grassland, where both the number of arriving seeds and the number of arriving species were approximately doubled compared to the natural seed rain. Also, in half of the plots, 36% of the vegetation and bryophyte cover was removed to simulate disturbance. Sowing significantly increased species richness and the number of seedlings in plots. Disturbance increased the number of seedlings but had no significant effect on species richness. In the first year, the highest number of seedlings was found in disturbed and sown plots. The dynamics of seedling numbers differed among species. Of the 15 sown species, seedlings of nine species were found in some plots. The number of seedlings of two species were not dependent on treatments, those of three species depended only on sowing, and for four species there was a significant positive interaction between sowing and disturbance. The establishment of sown species was not dependent on initial species richness or number of adult ramets in experimental plots. It was concluded that, though the behavior of individual species may differ, the local deficiency of seeds may be an important force generating small-scale community patterns of calcareous grasslands.

AB Understanding vegetation responses to landscape-scale disturbance often is critical for understanding ecosystem structure and function. Satellite remote sensing and geographic information systems can be used to determine whether response patterns observed in fine-scale studies are present at landscape scales. We used these technologies to examine key factors correlated with revegetation of Mount St. Helens in the first 15 yr following its catastrophic eruption in 1980. To measure revegetation, we used eight Landsat satellite scenes from 1984 to 1995 to estimate for each pixel (1) the time tin years) to reach an estimated 10% vegetation cover (EC10), (2) maximum rate of increase in vegetation cover (MR), (3) time-integrated vegetation cover (TIC), and (4) maximum estimated cover reached during the study period (MEC). Explanatory variables included type of volcanic disturbance, distance from the eruption, initial tephra thickness, distance from surviving forests, and topographic variables. Regression tree analysis (RTA) was used to model the response variables with the explanatory variables.
   RTA explained 50% of the variation in EC10, 57% of the variation in TIG, 31% of the variation in MR, and 51% of the variability in MEG. Remaining variability was a function of other variables, stochastic factors, and image processing. The greatest amount of variability in revegetation was explained by type of volcanic disturbance, which stratified the study area into primary and secondary successional areas and revealed previously undocumented patterns of where each successional type was present.
   Under secondary successional conditions, distance from the eruption and original tephra thickness were important. For primary successional areas, proximity to forest edges was important only at the edges of mudflows. Slope gradient was important for both secondary and primary successional areas. Landscape-scale patterns of revegetation were consistent with field studies of the importance of biotic legacies, colonizing vegetation, and topography. However, the importance of slope gradient for revegetation in primary successional areas has not been previously reported.

AB Population decline, local extinction, and recovery are profoundly influenced by variation in demography and life-history traits. Ln open populations, changes in patterns of recruitment may also have a major influence on the size of local populations, particularly for short-lived organisms. We examine here the demographic processes underlying a slow decline of corals on Jamaican reefs, where coral sever has decreased by fourfold over a 16-yr period. We divided the study into three approximately equal intervals (1977-1982, 1982-1987, and 1987-1993) and constructed size-based transition matrices for each of three abundant species of corals (Montastrea annularis, Agaricin agaricites, and Leptoseris cucullata) that differ substantially in life history: Montastrea is slower-growing, longer-lived. and has lower rates of recruitment than the other two species. Rates of survival, population growth (lambda), and recruitment declined substantially over time for all species and the stable size structures became increasingly dominated by small colonies. Elasticity and life table response analysis showed that changes in the persistence of large colonies had the biggest impact on population growth in all species. Simulations indicated that the levels of larval recruitment required to maintain populations at 1977 levels increased sharply over time, even as the actual recruitment rate declined. Recruitment failure was much more important to A. agaricites and L. cucullata than to M. annularis, which could survive long periods with minimal larval input. Recovery of these populations will require an increase in both survival and recruitment. The likelihood of the latter will depend on the scale of larval dispersal. and on the impact of targe-scale mortality of adults on stock-recruitment relationships. Differences in connectivity and life histories of corals will determine future patterns of recovery or further decline.

AB Host-parasitoid models with host density dependence were used to investigate the features that maximize biological control success. Relationships were derived in nonspatial models between parasitism level and host suppression at equilibrium. Spatially explicit metapopulation models could produce higher host suppression, and over a larger range of parameters, than nonspatial models. However, persistence of the metapopulation interaction depended critically on the starting conditions; for a realistic biological control starting point, a maximum mean suppression of 84% was compatible with persistence, although much greater host suppression could be achieved from less realistic initial conditions. This result was unchanged by spatial stochasticity. Overall metapopulation dynamics, as well as those of individual subpopulations, were best modeled by random parasitoid attack, even when the true attack behavior was otherwise. Fitting such models suggested that an independent estimate of host carrying capacity may be required when estimating host rate of increase from subpopulation data within a host-parasitoid metapopulation.

AB Temperate lake ecosystems are generally characterized by a strong annual cycle, and the relationships between observations of such ecosystems and external forcing variables can exhibit a complex structure. Furthermore, the observational data record is often short. This makes it difficult to assess the relationships between external forcing factors and their impact on the biological succession. Cycle-stationary maximum cross-covariance analysis (MCCA) allows the effects of seasonality to be modeled in a flexible way, and we describe this statistical technique in detail. MCCA offers an objective method to approximate the high-dimensional total cross-covariance structure by defining "weighting" patterns. With a predictor set of reduced dimension, a suitable regression between forcing variables and ecological response variables can be set up.
   Cyclo-stationary MCCA is used here to analyze the influence of meteorological variables (air temperature, wind speed, global radiation, humidity, and precipitation) on 13 biological and biogeochemical indicator variables of Plussee, a small lake in northern Germany. The main weather influence on the indicator variables was found to be connected to winter temperature. From the covariance structure the following major signals were detected to be related to higher winter temperature: a more intense spring algal maximum, a higher zooplankton biomass during the algal maximum, a less intense loss of nutrients to the hypolimnion, a higher summer bloom together with changes in the nutrient concentrations, and stronger oxygen consumption in autumn.

AB Comparisons of traits of outbreaking and nonoutbreaking leaf-eating Lepidoptera and Symphyta have shown that spring-feeding species are more likely to have outbreaks than are summer-feeding species. It has been suggested that variable synchrony with host budburst causes the population sizes of spring-feeding species to be more variable primarily because of the negative effects of older leaves on insects. While much evidence exists that leaf age can directly affect survival and reproduction of insects, few studies have looked at the population-level effects of variable phenology, and especially the potential for complex direct and indirect interactions with natural-enemy effects. To examine the consequences of variable phenology for population growth of an outbreaking insect, we manipulated the timing of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) egg hatch in the field. We released large numbers of gypsy moth larvae into replicate plots in the field at three times relative to budburst. Survival of larvae in protective sleeves was high unless they were released very long before host budburst, and leaf age had a direct negative effect on fecundity: the later the release, the lower was the fecundity of insects reared on white oak and black oak. The later the release, however, the greater was the dispersal by ballooning, which had the effect of reducing local densities. Because the most important natural enemies impose density-dependent mortality, dispersal had the effect of raising survival rate for later release dates. The direct host-plant effect and natural-enemy effects exhibited opposing influences on population processes, because fecundity decreased with release date but survival increased. The survival advantage of the late release outweighed the loss in fecundity, so that the expected population growth rate was highest for the latest release. The net effects of phenology on insect population growth thus depend largely on natural-enemy effects. Very different conclusions would have been drawn had we measured mortality only in protective sleeves and not in the presence of natural enemies. The strong natural-enemy effects may explain the large variability in outcome of plant-herbivore interactions and contribute to the high variability in population size of spring-feeding species.

AB We experimentally increased the number of eggs laid by Lesser Black-backed Gulls and examined the relationship between egg number and egg quality. Egg quality was measured in terms of egg composition and the probability that an egg would give rise to a fledged chick. In measuring the latter, we removed the potentially confounding effects (1) between parental quality and equality and (2) between increased egg production and parental condition, using a cross-fostering protocol in which eggs were reared by control parents. Lesser Black-backed Gulls were capable of producing, on average, almost three times the normal clutch of three eggs. Although egg mass did not fall below that of the last laid egg in normal clutches, as the clutch extended beyond three, experimental eggs contained relatively less lipid and relatively more water. Overall, the percentage of eggs that gave rise to hedged chicks (when reared singly by a foster parent) declined significantly with position in the experimental laying sequence; about two-thirds of the eggs laid at the beginning of the laying sequence gave rise to fledged chicks, whereas only about one-third of the last laid eggs did so. This was not due to any seasonal change in the capacity of foster parents to rear the chicks, and neither hatching nor fledging success of the eggs was related to their fresh mass. Thus, as more eggs are laid, important changes in egg composition occur that have in themselves, substantial effects on offspring survival. This study provides clear evidence of a trade-off between egg number and egg quality.

AB Herbivore damage can have indirect effects on plant fitness by influencing other important plant-animal interactions, such as pollination biology. For example, damage to floral and vegetative structures may influence the pattern of pollen movement within and among individual plants. In obligately outcrossing species, enhanced movement of self pollen (geitonogamy) can negatively impact fitness if self pollen clogs stigmas, interferes with stylar transmitting tracts, usurps ovules, or increases fruit abortion. We investigated whether early season browsing affects the fitness cost of self-pollination in the obligately outcrossing species scarlet gilia, Ipomopsis aggregata, using clipping and emasculation treatments.
   We found that clipping significantly reduced the production of flowers, fruits, and seeds whereas emasculation significantly increased the production of these components of female fitness. In addition, we detected a significant interaction between the clipping and emasculation treatments when considering four components of fitness simultaneously; emasculation led to an increase in the fitness of unclipped plants but not clipped plants. We propose two nonexclusive mechanisms to explain this pattern. First, damaged plants may experience reduced self-pollination due to reductions in pollinator visitation or effectiveness. Alternatively, damaged plants may simply lack the resources (or the ability to allocate resources) to benefit from emasculation. Our results support the notion that herbivory can have indirect effects on plant fitness through effects on other plant-animal interactions.

AB Spatial subdivision of the landscape can reduce the intensity of interspecific interactions, whether they be predation or competition. Recent models examining the ways in which spatial pattern in the landscape will influence the outcome of species interactions assume a trade-off between colonization ability and competitive ability in the interacting species. We tested for differential colonization and competitive ability in two interacting species of wolf spider (Hogna helluo and Pardosa milvina) which co-occur in agricultural and early successional habitats in the eastern USA. We conducted our research in replicated experimental soybean plots in which we created islands of enhanced habitat by supplementing natural litter and enhancing weed growth. Our experimental manipulations were repeated once for each of the two spider species: (1) spiders added, (2) prey attractants (composted vegetable waste) added, (3) spiders and prey attractants added, and (4) one control, for a total of eight subplots. We replicated the experiment six times, three times each in conventionally tilled fields and conservation tilled fields. We censused these plots at the end of the summer and found that conspecific addition significantly elevated numbers of one species (H. helluo) but not the other (P. milvina). These findings were consistent with our predictions that H. helluo is limited in colonization ability when compared to P. milvina, The addition of prey attractants significantly elevated numbers of both species, but the effect was far stronger for the superior colonist (P. milvina). This indicates that P. milvina is able to track resource abundance (both habitat structure and prey), a trait correlated with colonization ability. We found no strong evidence for a negative effect of H. helluo addition on numbers of P. milvina, as would be predicted if H. helluo strongly competed with or significantly preyed upon P, milvina. Body condition of P, milvina was lowest in subplots with higher numbers of H. helluo, indicating that H. helluo may have influenced the foraging success of P. milvina. We also found a strong and unexpected effect of the context of the plots (background tillage regime) on numbers of P. milvina, with there being approximately twice the P. milvina in the subplots in conventionally tilled fields.

AB Theory suggests that a source-sink structure for a prey species can promote the persistence of an otherwise nonpersisting predator-prey interaction. Using a heliozoan protist predator, Actinosphaerium nucleofilum, and a ciliated protozoan prey species, Tetrahymena pyriformis, we tested this prediction in laboratory microcosms. We created subdivided microcosms, each consisting of a 30-mL bottle containing predators and prey connected to a 30-mL bottle containing prey only. Prey dispersed freely through this connection, but predators did not disperse for hundreds of prey generations. The predators and prey in the subdivided microcosms persisted for over three times as long as they did in undivided 30-mL and 60-mL bottles. Our results suggest that prey rescue effects and spatial asynchrony in prey dynamics, characteristic metapopulation features, enhanced persistence in the subdivided microcosms. However, the details by which persistence was achieved closely resemble source-sink dynamics, not classic metapopulation dynamics. Evidence suggests that continuous prey immigration into predator-prey bottles from extinction-invulnerable prey-only bottles may have weakened the coupling between predator and prey dynamics and contributed to the increase in persistence. In showing that source-sink dynamics enhanced predator-prey persistence, our experiments support conclusions of metapopulation theory that point to the importance of immigration between spatially discrete populations.

AB Although ecologists were among the first scientists to study the implications of chaotic dynamics, there is still no widely accepted example of chaos in a field population. If current developments in nonlinear dynamics are to be of relevance to population ecology, however, it is necessary to determine whether chaos occurs in nature. Here we bring together two lines of evidence suggesting that the dynamics of vole populations in northern Fennoscandia may be chaotic: nonlinear analysis of time-series data, and a model based on biological mechanisms. We review how a mechanistic population model can be used to produce short-term population forecasts, even when one of the species is not observed, and then use this benchmark of model accuracy to support our choice of a mechanistic population model for vole dynamics.By adjusting model parameters to optimise the forecasting accuracy on the vole time series, we can obtain parameter estimates for the model. In tests on simulated data, this new approach to parameter estimation for stochastic dynamic models yields parameter estimates such that the fitted model produces dynamics qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those observed. However, some parameters are poorly identified (i.e., many different parameter combinations yield nearly identical model dynamics). For the best-fit parameters, the model dynamics are characterized by quasi-chaotic behavior; the global Lyapunov exponent is very close to (and statistically undistinguishable from) zero, but the median local Lyapunov exponent is significantly positive. Our findings of recurrent short-term chaos suggest that vole dynamics in northern Fennoscandia are characterized by a blend of order and irregularity. The irregularity is the same type as would occur in a noisy chaotic system (i.e., exogenous noise amplification by sensitive dependence on initial conditions) but only occurs during specific portions of the oscillation.

AB The goal of this investigation was to study the effects of spatially structured habitat heterogeneities on locally dispersing single-species populations. In this investigation, the environmental heterogeneities were not randomly distributed, but rather were clustered by specifying probabilities of small local configurations of the landscape, as in local structure or pair approximations. This allows the study of landscapes with the same amount of habitat loss but different levels of fragmentation or clustering. I describe a simple algorithm for generating such structured landscapes. Spatially explicit simulations of population models on these landscapes were performed using stochastic cellular automata and compared to predictions from mean-field and pair approximations, for which detailed derivations are presented.
   For populations with local dispersal, I show that the spatial correlations of habitat types completely determine equilibrium population density on suitable sites and that the amount of suitable habitat has no effect, precisely the opposite of what the mean-field approximation predicts. When habitat types are randomly distributed on the landscape, the two approximations do almost equally well, and thus the additional complexity of the pair approximation is not justified. However, when habitat types are not randomly distributed, the mean-field approximation gives qualitatively incorrect predictions for population response to varying habitat heterogeneity. Thus, pair approximations combine some of the best features of spatially explicit and implicit models and serve as a useful supplement to those methods for understanding spatially structured ecological systems, especially where environmental heterogeneities are spatially correlated.

AB A large portion of terrestrial carbon (C) resides in soil organic carbon (SOC). The dynamics of this large reservoir depend on many factors, including climate. Measurements of C-13:C-12 ratios, C concentrations, and C:N ratios at six forest sites in the Southern Appalachian Mountains (USA) were used to explore several hypotheses concerning the relative importance of factors that control soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and SOC turnover. Mean delta(13)C values increased with soil depth and decreasing C concentrations along a continuum from fresh litter inputs to more decomposed soil constituents. Data from the six forest sites, in combination with data from a literature review, indicate that the extent of change in delta(13)C values from forest litter inputs to mineral soil (similar to 20 cm deep) is significantly associated with mean annual temperature. The findings support a conceptual model of vertical changes in forest soil delta(13)C values, C concentrations, and C:N ratios that are interrelated through climate controls on decomposition. We hypothesize that, if other environmental factors (like soil moisture) are not limiting, then temperature and litter quality indirectly control the extent of isotopic fractionation during SOM decomposition in temperate forest ecosystems.

AB Uptake of glycine was studied in four plants commonly used in grasslands in northern Europe (Phleum pratense, Trifolium hybridum, T. pratense, and Ranunculus acris) and compared to uptake of ammonium and nitrate. The experiment was conducted in the field, but with plants transferred to pots with soil 8-10 d before the start of the experiment. Plant uptake of U-(C2N)-C-13-N-15 glycine, (NH4+)-N-15, and (NO3-)-N-15 was studied by injecting dilute (1 mmol/L) solutions of respectively labeled N source into the pots and harvesting plants 21 h later. Measurements of C-13 and N-15 in roots showed that, in all plants, part of the glycine N was taken up in the form of intact amino acid. Hence, regressions of plots of excess C-13 against excess N-15 showed that a minimum of 19-23% of the glycine-derived N was taken up as intact amino acid; possible losses of labeled C atoms of glycine during its metabolism in the plants implies that these estimates are conservative. Uptake of the different N sources was similar in the two Trifolium species, while rates of nitrate uptake were comparably high in P. pratense, and rates of glycine uptake were comparably low in R. acris. N-15 labeling of shoots was detected in all species, whereas significant levels of C-13 tracer was only found in shoots of P. pratense. It is concluded that a capacity for uptake of organic N exists also in an agricultural setting, despite the rapid turnover of organic N usually found under such conditions. This adds to the growing knowledge of plant utilization of organic N sources in natural ecosystems and stresses the need for reexamining this step in the biogeochemical N cycle.

AB A central goal in ecology is to predict population dynamics from demographic information. Based on the asymptotic population growth rate lambda, calculated from a projection matrix model as a descriptor of the population dynamics, we analyze published data of 49 species of birds to determine how lambda is influenced by variation in different demographic trails. Across species, the mean elasticity of the adult survival rate was significantly larger than the mean elasticity of the fecundity rate. The contribution of the fecundity rate to the population growth rate increased with increasing clutch size and decreasing adult survival rare. while the greatest contribution of adult survival rate occurred among long-lived species that matured late and laid few eggs. This represents a continuum from "highly reproductive species" at one end to "survivor species" at the other end. In addition, a high contribution of adult survival rate was found in some relatively long-lived species with early age at maturity (and a large clutch size) which was assumed to represent a bet-hedging strategy, i.e., producing a large number of offspring in some occasional good years. In a retrospective analysis. interspecific differences in the effects of actual temporal variation in adult survival rate and fecundity rats on the variability of lambda were analyzed. These effects are expected to be large when the variance or the sensitivity of the trait is large. Because there was a negative relationship among species, both for the adult survival rate and the fecundity rate between the variability and the sensitivity of the trait, contribution of a trait to the variance in lambda decreased with sensitivity. Similarly, within species, less temporal variation was found in traits with high elasticities than in traits with less contribution to lambda. In some species, covariance among matrix elements also influenced the contribution of a demographic trait to lambda. Monitoring schemes of bird demography should be designed in such a way that temporal variances and covariances among demographic traits can be estimated. Furthermore, it is important in such schemes to include data from a combination of traits that either have large sensitivities or high temporal variation.

AB Spectral transmittance signatures (expressed as absorbances) were studied as a potential indicator of photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic contributions to the canopy-absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). An analytical approach was made under laboratory conditions using synthetic canopies in an integrating sphere. This approach provided the basis for identifying spectral (absorbance-based) features and indices to estimate green (photosynthetic) and nongreen (structural and dead materials) contributions to canopy absorbance. A strong relationship was found between the amplitude of the first derivative of the absorbance (A(RE)) and green area, while the integrated absorbance in the PAR region (A(PAR)) mainly responded to variations in total area. The ratio A(RE)/A(PAR) was closely correlated to the fraction of photosynthetic area to total area (i.e., the canopy green fraction). Similarly, the ratio and normalized difference of the absorbances at 680 and 900 nm (A(SR) and A(NDVI)) closely tracked variations in the canopy green fraction. Subsequently, these indices were tested in field plots with contrasting structural characteristics. Under field conditions, A(RE) was a good indicator of green biomass. The indices A(SR) and A(NDVI) were also reliable indicators of green biomass but were affected by changes in sampling conditions. As in the lab study, A(RE)/A(PAR) was a good indicator of canopy green fraction. Thus, ground-based measurements of canopy spectral transmittance provided a tool for determining the photosynthetic contribution to canopy-absorbed PAR by correcting for nonphotosynthetic canopy components. Moreover, A(RE) showed a strong correlation with conventional vegetation indices derived from spectral reflectance measurements. This technique could be a useful tool for plant ecophysiology studies and a field-validation method for remote-sensing studies.

AB Plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) can affect survival, reproduction, and distribution of herbivores. Individuals with a high capacity to tolerate PSMs will experience fewer and smaller adverse effects than less tolerant individuals. Theoretically. the capacity to tolerate PSMs can be acquired during development, modulated during adulthood, or genetically fixed. We studied tolerance to phenolic resin from creosote bush (Larrea tridentain) in two populations of desert woodrats as a first step in understanding phenotypic habituation and genetic adaptation of this species to creosote resin. One population was from Mojave desert habitat where woodrats eat creosote bush, and the other from the Great Basin desert, where creosote bush is not present and woodrats consume mainly juniper (Juniperus osteosperma). For >1 mo in the laboratory, woodrats from both populations were fed rabbit chow with increasing amounts of phenolic resin extracted from creosote bush until they lost body mass or showed any sign of sickness. Woodrats from the Mojave population maintained body mass at higher concentrations of resin and remained in the experiment longer. There were no differences between populations in food intake across all resin levels; however, maximum resin intake was 25% higher for the Mojave population Food intake decreased with increasing resin intake. Glucuronic acid excretion in urine, one indicator of detoxification capacity, did not differ between populations. Water consumption increased with increased levels of creosote resin in the diet in woodrats from both populations. The results are consistent with the idea of differential tolerance to creosote bush phenolic resin in desert woodrat populations. Woodrats appear to be a promising natural system to study the developmental or genetic factors underlying vertebrate adaptation to plant secondary metabolites.

AB Feeding-induced plant resistance is a well-documented phenomenon for leaf-chewing insects. Furthermore, feeding-induced resistance provides the mechanistic basis for many cases of delayed interspecific competition, whereby previous feeding by one species diminishes the performance of other herbivores which attack the same plant later in the season. This phenomenon, however, has been very poorly investigated for sap-feeding insects. The results we present here fur salt marsh-inhabiting planthoppers (Prokelisia dolus and P. marginata) provide one of the few known examples of delayed, plant-mediated interspecific competition between two sap-feeding insects.
   Three lines of experimental evidence from the laboratory, field cages, and open field plots provide support for the detrimental effects of previous feeding by one planthopper species on the subsequent survival and performance of the other. Laboratory experiments showed that prior feeding on cordgrass by one congener resulted in reduced performance of the other in the following generation. However, the effect was asymmetric. Prior feeding by P. dolus resulted in prolonged development and reduced body size (a correlate of fecundity) in P. marginata, whereas only development was protracted in P. dolus when plants were previously exposed to P. marginata. Consequently, P. dolus appears to be the superior competitor in the context of delayed, plant-mediated interactions. The negative effects of previous feeding by P. dolus on the development time, body size, and survival of P, marginata obtained in the laboratory were confirmed both in cages and on cage-free islets of cordgrass in the field. Feeding-induced reductions in host-plant quality by P. dolus may provide additional impetus for P. marginata to migrate from shared habitats on the high marsh to nutritionally superior plants in the low marsh rarely occupied by P. dolus.
   The mechanism underlying the delayed competitive effects between Prokelisia planthoppers is most likely diminished plant nutrition, because feeding by P, dolus significantly reduces the concentration of essential amino acids in cordgrass. The asymmetry of plant-mediated competition between the Prokelisia species may be due to the ability of P. dolus to better tolerate feeding-depleted levels of plant nitrogen via compensatory feeding.
   Even though these two planthoppers do not suffer significant fitness reductions during contemporaneous interactions, they compete severely in the context of feeding-induced plant resistance which is expressed later in the season. This result, coupled with the fact that most studies of interspecific interaction between herbivorous insects are contemporaneous, indicates that interspecific competition may be profoundly underestimated as a structuring force in phytophagous insect communities.

AB This paper addresses how dispersal ability of the geometrid moth Itame andersoni interacts with habitat subdivision to impact population structure, importance of different habitat types (e.g., patch sizes, habitat configurations), and regional distribution patterns in a subdivided habitat of patches of its host plant Dryas drummondii (Rosaceae). Habitat subdivision occurs both on the patch scale and on the larger spatial scale of sites due to patchy successional patterns. Itame distribution is patchy within areas colonized by Dryas. This research combines observational and experimental approaches to examine individual movement behavior, immigration, and emigration rates of both caterpillars and adult females at the scale of discrete Dryas patches. Itame caterpillars will cross bare ground separating plant patches: however, movement of caterpillars on bare ground was more restricted than predicted by a correlated random walk due to large turning angles which led to area-restricted search. Caterpillar immigration into patches previously cleared of Itame is usually low and is negatively affected by patch isolation when local Itame densities are high. Caterpillar emigration is also significantly greater from patches with high Itame density. Immigration of females, which have reduced wings, was positively influenced by patch isolation and negatively influenced by the presence of a barrier preventing adult females from walking into patches. All females emigrate from their point of emergence and continue moving as they oviposit. Females lay eggs singly on foliage, in leaf litter, and on rocks under and surrounding Dryas patches. Significantly more eggs are laid off of Dryas patches than within Dryas patches, but this is not a result of concentration of searching effort off of Dryas patches. Females move greater distances than predicted by a correlated random walk. Movement parameters combined with oviposition parameters lead to the prediction that the: average female will lay all of her eggs within 5-15 m of her starting point. Restricted movement appears to demographically isolate: sites separated by distances of as little as 0.5 km. Limited between-site dispersal may link these populations into metapopulations and may explain patchy regional patterns of distribution. Within sites, densities are likely to build up in smaller patches and subdivided habitat due to preferential oviposition on bare ground. These smaller patches may in turn be disproportionally important for population processes due to their contribution of dispersers through density-dependent emigration within and between sites. Thus, this research demonstrates how limited dispersal can impact patterns of distribution, abundance, and population structure in a natural system.

AB Associational resistance, which refers to decreased herbivory experienced by a plant growing with heterospecific neighbors, is a well documented ecological phenomenon. In contrast, studies that describe increased herbivory due to heterospecific neighbors (associational susceptibility) are relatively rare. In this study we document associational susceptibility among hosts of the fall cankerworm (Alsophila pometaria). Cottonwoods (Populus angustifolia X P. fremontii) located under box elder (Acer negundo) were colonized by two to three times more cankerworms, and suffered two to three times greater defoliation than cottonwoods growing under mature cottonwoods, or cottonwoods growing in the open. This associational pattern reflects fall cankerworm's strong preference for box elder over cottonwood: egg densities were 26 times greater on box elder than cottonwood, first instar larvae consumed 75 times more box elder than cottonwood in larval palatability trials, and fourth instar larvae consumed three times more box elder than cottonwood. In terms of larval performance, first instar larvae exhibited approximately six times greater mortality and 40% slower development time on cottonwood relative to box elder, whereas fourth instar larval performance did not differ between the hosts. Based on these and other findings, we predict that, when generalist herbivores reach outbreak proportions and consume their preferred hosts, they will then move to nearby less-preferred hosts to complete their life cycle. This "spillover" effect will result in associational susceptibility for less-preferred hosts and is likely common in forest outbreak situations where herbivore densities are high. With increased emphasis on diversified plantings in agriculture and forestry, it is important to understand potential drawbacks such as associational susceptibility.

AB We present and apply a method for analyzing size-dependent patterns of resource acquisition by individuals within stands of competing plants. Our approach relies on curve-fitting to relate empirical measures of resource acquisition with various aspects of plant size and form. These relationships are referred to as size-uptake relationships (SURs). We demonstrate the use of this approach by characterizing the size dependence of light and nitrogen acquisition within developing stands of birch seedlings. Results of a number of phenomenological studies have predicted that competition for light is expected to be size asymmetric and that competition for belowground resources is expected to be size symmetric. Our study provides the first direct empirical test far these hypotheses.
   Application of the SUR approach largely confirms predictions regarding the size-dependent nature of light and belowground resource (nitrogen) acquisition. The uptake of nitrogen by birch seedlings was size symmetric, regardless of which aspect of size we considered (i.e., root mass, root length, root surface area, number of root tips, number of mycorrhizal root tips). In contrast, light interception was size asymmetric in relation to height and leaf area, but size symmetric in relation to total plant biomass. Differences in the degree of size-asymmetry of Light acquisition between different measures of size were driven by the nature of the allometric relationships between plant height, biomass, and leaf area.
   SURs offer a tool for exploring some of the mechanistic processes related to resource-based interactions. Using this approach, we demonstrate that it is possible to characterize simultaneously the size-dependent patterns of multiple resources within competing plant populations. We suggest that this approach may prove valuable for identifying how size-dependent patterns of resource acquisition vary through ontogeny. We conclude with a discussion of the need for a more mechanistic understanding of plant-plant interactions and the role that the SUR approach can play towards this goal.

AB Compensatory population dynamics, in which species that decline in response to an environmental perturbation are replaced by similar species, may be crucial in maintaining processes performed by functional groups of species. Compensatory dynamics may be produced by negative interactions among species, such that the decrease in abundance of a species releases the suppression of another species and allows it to increase. We conducted a mesocosm experiment in Trout Lake, Wisconsin, USA, to test the hypothesis that compensatory shifts in species abundances play a role in overall planktonic community response to pH perturbation. In 2000-L mesocosms over a period of six weeks, we contrasted a control treatment with two acidified treatments (press, sustained pH = 4.7; and pulse, alternating pH = 4.7 and ambient pH). In the acidified treatments, we saw changes in abundance of the major zooplankton and phytoplankton species, but we observed few cases of compensatory dynamics. Nonetheless, when present, compensatory dynamics could be strong. Analyses using autoregressive models revealed negative interactions among species that could potentially lead to compensatory dynamics. However, this potential for compensatory dynamics was not realized in cases where all species were sensitive to the pH perturbations. Therefore, compensatory dynamics that buffer community responses to perturbations may be limited in communities in which many species are sensitive to the perturbation.

AB Genetic variation in photosynthetic traits within populations provides the potential for evolution, but few studies relate phenotypic variation in these traits to variation in fitness. We tested the prediction that a lower photosynthetic rate reduces fecundity and survivorship by comparing wild-type (WT) Amaranthus hybridus family lines to those having a single-gene mutation that confers resistance to atrazine (R) and lowers the rate of photosynthetic carbon assimilation. Wild-type and R family lines with nearly uniform nuclear genomes were used to minimize the confounding effects of other loci. We established experimental populations in agricultural and one-year-old field plots and measured chlorophyll fluorescence, gas exchange, and the fecundity and survivorship of WT and R genotypes for two generations.
   The R genotype had a lower efficiency of electron transport through photosystem II, which translated into a 20-30% decrease in photosynthetic rate at light levels above 400 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). Compared to the WT, the R genotype also had lower water-use efficiency, higher specific leaf area, and greater leaf nitrogen concentration on a mass, but not area, basis. In five of six replicate populations, the R genotype had lower fecundity than the WT in the first generation. Survivorship of seed over winter was similar for the two genotypes, but survivorship of R seedlings during early establishment was lower than the WT in the agricultural held. The consistent pattern of selection against the R genotype during vegetative growth stages suggests that a lower photosynthetic rate reduces fitness. This selection, paired with heritable variation for photosynthetic traits within populations, provides a more complete scenario for the evolution of photosynthetic traits.

AB For many species, not all required resources are contained in breeding habitat. Such species depend on landscape complementation, i.e., linking together different landscape elements through movement, to complete their life cycles. We suggest that the dichotomous habitat classification of many metapopulation analyses (habitat vs. nonhabitat) masks our ability to detect metapopulation effects for such species. We tested this using a species for which landscape complementation is obligate and metapopulation structure is likely: Rana pipiens, the northern leopard frog. We used breeding chorus survey data to index relative abundance of leopard frogs in 34 "core" ponds and conducted Poisson regression analysis to determine the effects on frog density of local pond habitat, availability of summer habitat (landscape complementation), and number of occupied ponds in the surrounding landscapes (metapopulation structure). All of these factors had statistically significant effects on frog density. However, when summer habitat was not included in the statistical model, the metapopulation structure was no longer significant; i.e., its effect was masked. Our results suggest that one must be cautious in applying the results of metapopulation analyses to species for which the habitat vs. nonhabitat categorization of the landscape is not appropriate. The potential for rescue and recolonization to maintain a regional population must be assessed within the constraints of the entire landscape.

AB We used spadefoot toad larvae to evaluate assumptions and test predictions of the Wilbur and Collins model for plasticity in age and size at metamorphosis. The model assumes that there is a threshold during larval development after which it is possible to metamorphose and to accelerate metamorphosis in response to certain environmental stimuli. The threshold presumably sets the minimum size and/or age at metamorphosis. Development after the threshold is modified according to environmental conditions, with growth rate serving as an index of environmental quality. Rapidly growing larvae are predicted to delay metamorphosis to take advantage of a favorable larval environment. Slower growers are predicted to transform closer to the threshold, thus enabling them to escape from a poor larval environment. Groups of three larvae from all three species (Experiment 1) or isolated larvae from two species (Experiment 2) in the genus Scaphiopus were reared at three food levels. At predetermined ages, subsamples of larvae had their food supply eliminated. The cessation of feeding represents a decline in the quality of the larval environment. After food elimination, larvae either completed development or entered a developmental stasis, making no further progress toward metamorphosis. The ability to complete development was demarcated by a specific stage of development or a narrow range of stages, thus defining a threshold. The threshold for successful metamorphosis was arrived at earlier at higher food levels and is best described as a function of both stage and mass. If food was eliminated after the threshold had been reached, the starved larvae completed larval development at an earlier age than continuously fed controls at each food level except the lowest food treatment of S. intermontanus. The magnitude of this acceleration of development was greatest in fast-growing (high food) larvae and smallest in slow growers (low food). These results confirm that all three species respond to a decline in the quality of the larval environment as predicted by Wilbur and Collins. Furthermore, the interspecies comparison implies an adaptive shift in this plasticity in the form of a change in the stage of development that serves as a threshold, the degree of acceleration in development rate after the threshold, and the flexibility in the amount of growth that is seen after the threshold. S. couchii, which is derived from the most ephemeral environment, reaches the threshold at an earlier stage of development. It also displays a greater proportional acceleration in development rate after the threshold, matched by a larger trade-off in reduced body size at metamorphosis in comparison with species from less ephemeral environments.

AB We examined the role of the omnivorous fish, gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), in transporting nutrients from sediments into the water column and their subsequent impacts on phytoplankton. We manipulated sediment access and fish size during two mesocosm experiments to determine how these factors could alter the effects of gizzard shad on phytoplankton. In the first experiment, gizzard shad stimulated phytoplankton only when they could feed directly on lake sediments and not when benthic feeding was prevented by a mesh netting. In the second experiment, small gizzard shad stimulated phytoplankton to a greater extent than did an equivalent biomass of large gizzard shad. In the absence of gizzard shad, zooplankton became more abundant, and phytoplankton were less P limited, compared to treatments with gizzard shad present. This suggests a shift from grazer limitation in the absence of gizzard shad to direct limitation by nutrients in the presence of gizzard shad. Gizzard shed stimulated total N and P, suggesting an important nutrient transport effect. Thus, gizzard shad impact phytoplankton through an interaction of top-down and bottom-up effects, which are facilitated by a large detrital subsidy to this system.

AB We determined whether plants benefit from a reduction in irradiance when growth is limited by low temperatures. Growth of snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora Sieb, ex Spreng,) seedlings was studied in response to two irradiance regimes (100% and 50% sunlight) under field conditions during autumn and winter. Seedlings were planted on north (exposed) and south (sheltered) sides of vertical screens transmitting 50% incident sunlight. This planting arrangement allowed assessment of affects of excess irradiance on growth of seedlings subject to common temperature minima, Over winter, sheltered seedlings were less photoinhibited, had higher photosynthetic CO, assimilation rates, lost less leaf area, and maintained a higher leaf-area ratio than exposed seedlings. These differences were consistent with greater growth of sheltered than exposed seedlings by the end of winter. These results show that shading may contribute to facilitation of regeneration by nurse plants in frost-prone environments.

   ABSORPTION; MECHANISMS
AB We used a combination of surveys of natural vegetation and seed-sowing and seedling transplant experiments to determine the relative importance of competition and microenvironmental modification as mechanisms by which understory vegetation influences the establishment of tree seedlings in an Alaskan postfire boreal forest. Seedlings of white spruce (Picea glauca) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) became established more frequently than expected in patches that were dominated by horsetail (Equisetum arvense), and less frequently than expected in patches of bluestem (Calamagrostis canadensis) and other vegetation. Similarly, birch and spruce, whether sown directly or transplanted as seedlings into horsetail-dominated patches generally showed greater survivorship, growth, and nitrogen accumulation (for birch only) than did those transplanted into bluestem or quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) patches. Clipping experiments demonstrated that the presence of aboveground vegetation reduced survivorship (for birch only), growth (for both species), and nitrogen accumulation (for spruce only) in all patch types. Thus, the understory vegetation in all patch types competed with tree seedlings. However, patch x clipping interactions were either absent or could not explain the greater inhibition of seedling establishment by bluestem or aspen than by horsetail. The strong inhibitory effect of bluestem and aspen on the establishment of spruce and birch seedlings is best explained by the unfavorable temperature and moisture microenvironments in these patches, rather than by differential competition in patches of bluestem, horsetail, or aspen. Many asymmetrical species interactions that are thought to drive successional change may result more from the contrasting effects that species have on their environment than from resource competition among species.

AB We compiled studies that report data on the relationship between animal population density and patch or island area for 287 individual species and 21 faunas. We tested the assumption of the equilibrium theory of island biogeography that population densities are independent of area by performing a meta-analysis using the linear correlation coefficient. r, as a measure of the effect of area on population density. We fit meta-analyses that used a random-effects model to these data to test far the effects of taxa. habitat, latitude, spatial scale, and overall population density. We also fit meta-analyses that used a fixed-effect model to the same data to estimate the repeatability of measurements of the correlation between population density and area within species.
   Contrary to the equilibrium theory of island biogeography, our results indicate that, on average, animal population densities are positively correlated with area, which suggests that density compensation may be uncommon. This result was found fur individual species, but not for faunas. We found taxonomic differences in the correlation between population density and area, with insects and birds having on average large or moderately large positive correlations, respectively, and mammals having correlations near zero, Observations within individual species showed considerable repeatability. The observed overall positive correlation between the population density of individual animal species and area is best explained in the context of the resource concentration hypothesis.
   Our results imply that the regional abundance and persistence of animal populations may depend strongly on the presence and continued persistence of a few large patches of suitable habitat, rather than on a regional network of small and large habitat patches.

AB Food availability, energetic ceilings, and life-history trade-offs have been proposed as potential determinants of offspring number in many animals. We investigated the role of these factors in determining litter size in a free-ranging population of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). Long-term observational data were used to assess the influence of food availability, while experimental manipulations of litter size permitted evaluation of the importance of energetic ceilings and life-history trade-offs. Among unmanipulated litters, juvenile growth rate and survival, but not litter size, were significantly related to annual food supply. Experimental increases in offspring number were successfully sustained in a high- and a low-food year, but in both years increases in litter sizes were associated with pronounced declines in juvenile growth rates. However, the reduced size of offspring in augmented litters did not fully compensate for the increase in offspring number, so that the total litter mass supported by augmented females was much higher than that of control females. During late lactation, augmented females were characterized by increased daily energy expenditure, but not by significant changes in time budgets, relative to control females. Increases in litter size did not appear to reduce maternal survival, but were associated with declines in offspring survival. Together, these results indicate that food availability and energetic ceilings do not limit litter size in red squirrels directly, but that tradeoffs between offspring number and offspring survival may eliminate any advantage of weaning larger-than-normal litters.

AB The nitrogen content of plant tissue is low relative to that of herbivores; as a consequence, dietary N can limit the: growth and reproduction of herbivores and select for attributes that increase N acquisition. Bark beetles face a particularly severe challenge because the phloem that they consume is very low in nitrogen and phosphorus relative to their requirements. We quantified variation in the phloem concentrations of N and P in the host tree, Pinus taeda, and evaluated the following hypotheses regarding the role of sym-host biotic fungi in nutrient budgets of the herbivore Dendroctonus frontalis: D, frontalis experience variation in phloem nutrient concentrations across several spatial scales (H-1); mycangial fungi enhance the diet of D. frontalis larvae by contributing to the acquisition of N and P (H-2); Ophiostoma minus, an apparently antagonistic fungal symbiont, hinders D, frontalis larvae because it does not enhance nutrient concentrations of the phloem as much as mycangial fungi do (H-3); and larvae of bark beetle species that lack mycangial fungi must consume more phloem to accomplish the same growth as larvae of D. frontalis (H-4). In addition, we developed a general model for the N budgets of herbivorous insects that identifies the possible combinations of dietary and physiological parameters that can allow developmental success on low-nutrient diets.
   Spatial variation in phloem N was mostly at the level of trees within sites (a scale of meters) while P mostly varied among sites (a scale of kilometers). Trees with higher N content produced larger D. frontalis adults. Prior to infestation by beetles, phloem nutrient concentrations were very uniform within trees and very low relative to that of the bark beetles (N and P concentrations of D. frontalis adults were 28 and 8 times greater, respectively). During infestation, phloem nutrient concentrations increased overall and be came highly variable within trees, Nitrogen concentrations increased from 0.40 +/- 0.01% (ean +/- SE) in uninfested phloem to 0.86 +/- 0.03% in the phloem surrounding successfully developing D. frontalis larvae, which are typically associated with one or two species of mutualistic mycangial fungi. Nitrogen concentrations were intermediate in other microhabitats within infested trees, including regions with no adult colonization, with failed larval development, or colonized by the antagonistic bluestain fungus O. minus. We parameterized a general nutrient-budget model for D. frontalis and a sympatric non-mycangial bark beetle, Ips grandicollis, which indicated that (1) mycangial fungi provide their benefits by concentrating dietary N for larvae; (2) O. minus may exert its antagonistic effects on D. frontalis larvae by failing to concentrate dietary N as much as mycangial fungi do; (3) non-mycangial bark beetles meet their N budgets through high consumption of unaltered, low-N phloem; and (4) larvae should easily meet their P requirments with any combination of consumption rate and development time that allows them to meet their N requirements. Alternative strategies for N acquisition may have general consequences for the population dynamics and community interactions of bark beetles.

AB I examine how habitat patchiness influences the distribution, abundance, and spatial dynamics of the geometrid moth Itame andersoni in the Wrangell Mountains of Alaska. Itame inhabits a subdivided habitat created by patches of its host plant Dr) as drummondii (Rosaceae) growing on bare ground. Habitat subdivision occurs both on the patch scale and on the larger spatial scale of sites due to patchy successional patterns. I surveyed five distinct sites to examine the relationships between plant patch size, patch isolation. Itame density, and pupal mass. I censused Itame caterpillar density in over 200 plant patches fur 1-3 years and found that densities were highest in medium-sized Dryas patches and lowest in very large "carpets" of Dryas. Isolated and small patches had high variance in density leading to lower mean densities. In contrast to density, pupal masses were highest in the largest patches, indicating a positive effect of patch size on individual fecundity, which was highly correlated with pupal mass. Results from the survey, as well as experimental manipulations of density, showed that Itame density had a negative effect on pupal mass. By using observed caterpillar densities and pupal masses to predict egg densities, I determined that the variance in pupal masses between patches was nut sufficient to explain the observed density-dependent population dynamics. Thus it appears that caterpillar density itself has mure important population-level impacts than does pupal mass. Contrary to predictions in the literature, this leads to the conclusion that smaller plant patches and the subdivided habitat that they constitute are disproportionally important for Itame populations.
   Temporal population dynamics were fairly synchronous between Dryas patches within sites but asynchronous between sites separated by >0.5 km, suggesting that sites may form distinct populations of Itame. This work shows the direct impacts of even very small-scale habitat patchiness on species distribution and abundance and how effects at the small spatial scale may combine with effects of larger scale subdivision to determine population structure.

AB In order to test whether changes in forest composition observed while sampling portions of the landscape originating from different fires may be explained by stand-level processes, I reconstructed species and stand dynamics for mesic sites in the mixed-boreal forests of Quebec. The stands studied are located in the forest surrounding Lake Duparquet in northwestern Quebec and originated from eight successive fires representing a chronosequence of 230 yr. Tree composition and ecological characteristics were assessed in 313 quadrats distributed systematically within the burned areas; one representative stand per fire, presenting the average species composition for clay soils with a moderate moisture regime, was selected for detailed dendroecological analysis. All living and dead stems (> 1 cm dbh) were mapped and cut down in a 20 x 20 m quadrat. Cross sections collected at the root collar and at every meter were analyzed using standard dendrochronological techniques. The age of the stand before the last fire was estimated using snags and logs located in, or in the vicinity of, each quadrat.
   A PCA (principal-components analysis) ordination of all quadrats shows a gradual change with time since fire from stands dominated by hardwoods (aspen and paper birch), to mixed stands with an important white spruce component, to coniferous stands dominated by balsam fir and white cedar. Despite variations in the age and composition of the stands before the last fire, they generally follow a common pattern characterized by post-fire hardwood dominance. Age structures show successive waves of aspen, birch, and fir recruitment, corresponding respectively to the post-fire cohort, the gradual dismissal of the first aspen cohort, and spruce budworm outbreaks. Each of these waves corresponds to a decrease in hardwoods and an increase in the conifer component of the stand. Suppressed white spruce individuals, recruited primarily as part of the post-fire cohort, experienced growth releases following the dismissal of the first aspen cohorts. White cedar increased in abundance late in succession and tended to outcompete balsam fir in old coniferous stands severely affected by spruce budworm outbreaks.
   The observed multi-cohort process contrasts with the simple replacement of hardwoods by conifers as suggested by observations of differential growth rates. The patchy distribution of conifer regeneration together with the poorer ability of conifers to rapidly fill gaps may explain why hardwoods are successfully recruited. This gradual rate of change, occurring over several generations, results in the maintenance of an important hardwood component in most stands even in the absence of fire. After 230 yr, stands are still mainly composed of trees originating from punctuated events such as fire, the gradual dismissal of the first aspen cohort, or spruce budworm outbreaks. This contrasts with old-growth boreal forests dominated by spruces in which a quasi-equilibrium is maintained by small canopy disturbances. The study confirms that changes in forest composition observed while sampling portions of the landscape originating from different fires may be explained by simple processes occurring at the stand level.

AB The spatial heterogeneity of a subtidal marine landscape and the areal extent of both monospecific and mixed patches of seagrass species were studied in Tamps Bay, Florida, USA. Specifically, we examined the temporal dynamics of seagrass distribution and its relationship to water depth and the serial replacement of one species by another. The similar to 5-ha landscape was mapped at l-m intervals in the spring and fall of 1994 and 1995. The landscape consisted of monospecific and mixed patches of seagrass (47%) and bare sediment (53%). Halodule wrightii was the most abundant seagrass (similar to 74%), while Thalassia testudinum was second most common (20%), and mixed patches of H. wrightii and T. testudinum composed the remaining 6%.
   There was an overall increase in seagrass of 14% from spring 1994 to fall 1995. The majority of change occurred along the margins of existing seagrass patches (i.e., H. wrightii invading bare sediment). Typically, "new" patches were the result of the transition of one seagrass species to another (e.g., H. wrightii replacing T. testudinum). Water depth over the landscape ranged from 30 to 100 cm, and although seasonal differences in the distribution of seagrass species were detected, water depth in this landscape was not an adequate predictor of the observed distributional patterns of either seagrass species at any season.
   Temporal transitions of one seagrass species to another, or to/from bare sediment, did nor fit previously published models of seagrass succession. Instead, H. wrightii, the competitive "inferior," often replaced T. testudinum as the dominant seagrass, suggesting that factors other than competition may have a controlling influence in this landscape. We suspect that hydrodynamics (e.g., seasonal storm events) may be an organizing force in maintaining the landscape's heterogeneity.

AB Parapatry describes a geographic pattern in which the ranges of two species have separate but contiguous distributions without any physical barriers between them. We present results from a study of ecological mechanisms to explain parapatry in closely related species. These include competition, spatially varying performances, and dispersal that depends on the densities of both species. We use a model consisting of two coupled nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations with density-dependent diffusion terms and space-dependent Lotka-Volterra-like competing interaction terms. The model is analyzed by using a mixture of phase-plane analysis and numerical simulations.
   Results show that competition and dispersal can lead to completely segregated species ranges. Spatial variation favored and provided stability to parapatric distribution. Parapatry occurred under several conditions, including when both species were identical in dispersal, intrinsic rate of growth, and competition but differed in their spatial performances. Results indicate that overlapping distributions and parapatry are equally expected for close species. Moreover, similar species in parapatry tend to exhibit equivalent range sizes. This model explains how species can coexist regionally while maintaining spatial exclusion. It also describes how a species that is rare in distribution can invade the range of a similar and widespread species. We discuss the limitations of using present species distributions for recognizing modes of speciation, and we suggest studying more extensively the relationship between density-dependent dispersal and interspecific competition. We show that density-dependent dispersal can favor segregation.

AB Elasticity analysis is a useful tool in conservation biology. The relative impacts of proportional changes in fertility, juvenile survival, and adult survival on asymptotic population growth lambda (where ln(lambda) = r, the intrinsic rate of increase) are determined by vital rates (survival, growth, and fertility), which also define the life history characteristics of a species or population. Because we do nor have good demographic information For most threatened populations, it is useful to categorize species according to their life history characteristics and related elasticity patterns. To do this, we compared the elasticity patterns generated by the life tables of 50 mammal populations. In age-classified models, the sum of the fertility elasticities and the survival elasticity for each juvenile age-class are equal, thus, age at maturity has a large impact on the contribution of juvenile survival to lambda. Mammals that mature early and have large litters ("fast" mammals, such as rodents and smaller carnivores) also generally have short lifespans; these populations had relatively high fertility elasticities and lower adult survival elasticities. "Slow" mammals (those that mature late), having few offspring and higher adult survival rates (such as ungulates and marine mammals). had much lower fertility elasticities and high adult or juvenile survival elasticities. Although certain life history characteristics are phylogenetically constrained, we found that elasticity patterns within an order or family can be quite diverse, while similar elasticity patterns can occur in distantly related taxa.
   We extended our generalizations by developing a simple age-classified model parameterized by juvenile survival, mean adult survival, age at maturity, and mean annual fertility. The elasticity patterns of this model are determined by age at maturity, mean adult survival, and lambda, and they compare favorably with the summed elasticities of full Leslie matrices. Thus, elasticity patterns can be predicted, even when complete life table information is unavailable. In addition to classifying species fur management purposes, the results generated by this simplified model show how elasticity patterns may change if the viral rate information is uncertain. Elasticity analysis can be a qualitative guide for research and management, particularly for poorly known species, and a useful first step in a larger modeling effort to determine population viability.

AB Herbivores can directly increase nitrogen mobility by increasing the quality of organic matter entering the decomposition cycle, but they also may decrease nitrogen mobility by decreasing the biomass of high-nitrogen species in the plane community. We assessed effects of voles (Microtus) on nitrogen dynamics using exclosures in two riparian meadows (Crystal Bench and Blacktail Deer Creek) in Yellowstone National Park (USA). At both sites, the quantity of plant litter was decreased by herbivory following a vole population peak in 1992. At Crystal Bench, removal of voles caused a decrease in the nitrogen concentration and an increase in the C:N ratio of plant litter over the four years of the study. The higher quality litter produced in the presence of voles at Crystal resulted in a larger pool of potentially mineralizable nitrogen in soil from control plots relative to soils from plots that had not been accessible to voles. At Crystal, vole removal did not cause a change in plant community composition. However, at Blacktail, after several years of vole exclusion, legumes became more common in exclosures than in control plots that were accessible to voles. Selective herbivory on high-nitrogen legumes kept the litter quality outside exclosures low, whereas higher legume biomass caused a decrease in C:N ratio of plant litter inside exclosures. The removal of voles at Blacktail caused a 15% increase in the fraction of the soil nitrogen that was rapidly mineralizable.
   Our results show that voles increased nitrogen mobility, especially during and after population peaks. However, that increase was offset by decreases in nitrogen mineralization over longer periods when voles caused a decrease in high-quality plant litter produced by preferred forage plants, especially legumes: Thus, both the mechanisms by which voles affected nitrogen dynamics and the net effects of voles varied over time and space. The balance of direct and indirect effects may provide a general mechanistic explanation of whether herbivores increase or decrease the rate of nitrogen cycling.

AB We investigated the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus levels in whole fish and gut samples of several species of cyprinids, relating our findings to nutrient flux models. Some differences in whole-fish nutrient content across species, lakes, and seasons, as well as differences across fish length and mass, were found. N and P contents were highest in fathead minnows and lowest in pearl dace, with northern redbelly dace and finescale dace intermediate. Larger fish had higher percent C and lower percent N and P. However, all differences in whole fish C, N, and P chemistry were small. Cyprinids had the following mean composition: carbon, 46%; nitrogen, 9.7%; and phosphorus, 1.5%. The cyprinid molar C:N:P ratio was 242:16:1. These values make cyprinids relatively low in phosphorus compared to other fish that have been previously studied, especially members of the Percidae and Centrarchidae. Gut contents were lower in N and P than the whole fish, and C:N and C:P ratios were correspondingly higher in gut contents than in the whole fish. Thus, minnows must concentrate both of these nutrients within their biomass compared to what they eat. The N:P ratio of minnows and minnow gut contents had nearly identical means. All chemical variables showed lower variation in the fish than in the gut contents, supporting a homeostatic model of nutrient flux. Stable nitrogen isotope analysis found that minnows were similar to 3 parts per thousand (parts per thousand) heavier than their gut contents, providing evidence that gut contents analyzed were derived mainly from ingested material. A homeostatic nutrient model appears to be an appropriate one for fish.

AB There is great interest in the importance of nectar nutrients to fecundity in the Lepidoptera, but nutrient allocation has been difficult to measure quantitatively. Here we trace the allocation of nectar nutrients in the hawkmoth Amphion floridensis using naturally occurring variation in plant stable carbon isotopes and thereby derive a descriptive model of carbon flow into eggs. Because C-13 content (expressed as delta C-13, the C-13:C-12 ratio relative to a standard) depends on photosynthetic mode, moths were fed sucrose solution made with either either C-3 or C-4 sugar (beet or cane), both of which were distinct from larval host plant. In addition, two of four experimental diets contained an amino acid supplement distinct in delta C-13 from either sugar or larval host plant. Females were hand fed daily from experimental diets, and their eggs were collected and analyzed for delta C-13. Egg delta C-13 increased rapidly from a value resembling larval delta C-13, and followed an asymptotic pattern of carbon incorporation. The presence of amino acids in the diet had no effect on either fecundity or egg delta C-13. Because egg delta C-13 equilibrated at a value lower than delta C-13 diet, we invoke an allocation model in which carbon is contributed to eggs by two separate pools. One pool of carbon comes into isotopic equilibrium with adult diet, whereas the other does not, contributing carbon with an exclusively larval signature across a female's lifetime. Carbon fractional turnover rate and the relative contribution of the two pools were estimated by fitting the model to the data with nonlinear regression. The resulting model fitted the data well and indicated that 50-60% of egg carbon is derived from adult nectar sugars after the "mixing pool" has come into equilibrium. Thus, this study demonstrates that adult nectar sugars provide an important source of egg carbon and explores how properties of nutrient mixing and turnover can generate patterns of reproductive allocation.

AB The spatial distribution of seeds can influence several parameters of the natural regeneration of plant populations. Factors shaping seedfall patterns have been typically explored from the tree perspective (seed shadow) or from the population perspective (seed rain). However, the seed rain is actually composed of multiple seed shadows. In this paper, we use this framework to explore the variables shaping the seedfall pattern of the wild olive tree (Olea europaea var. sylvestris), a fleshy-fruited tree of the Mediterranean scrublands. We monitored the movement patterns of avian seed dispersers and the seedfall around each fruit-bearing O. europaea tree in two contrasting sites, differing in the degree of human management and abundance of scrub cover.
   None of the seed dispersers moved between microhabitats (different shrub species and open interspaces) as a function of microhabitat relative abundance. All dispersers foraged preferentially at O. europaea; only the smaller species visited open interspaces, and these only sporadically.
   Avoidance of open sites by frugivores, especially larger species, and their attraction to source trees were the major determinants of the seedfall pattern. Regarding seed size distribution among microhabitats, we found that only small seeds were significantly overrepresented in open interspaces. From the seed shadow perspective, seed density under trees was similar in the: two study sites, but it decreased with distance at a higher rate in the disturbed scrubland. From the seed rain perspective, seed density was significantly different among microhabitats, with open interspaces collecting few, if any, seeds, and places under source trees receiving the highest densities.
   Results from seed shadow and seed rain analyses were integrated to construct a path model to explore the relative contribution of spatial, microhabitat, and individual tree features to the seedfall pattern. Factors related to microhabitat were identified as having a major role in shaping seedfall pattern. Open interspaces collected few seeds, points under shrub species with sparse foliage collected moderate seed densities, and points under shrubs with dense foliage collected the highest seed densities. The comparison between sites suggests that habitat alteration (a reduction of the scrub layer) can lead to contrasting seedfall patterns. The occurrence of an abundant scrub layer in the well-preserved scrubland allowed a complex pattern of seed rain. In contrast, the sparse scrub cover in the disturbed scrubland yielded a seedfall pattern composed of multiple seed shadows constrained to the vicinity of tree crowns. Thus, our sampling design and analytical approach have proved useful in describing the relative importance of the set of variables that shapes the complex seedfall pattern of a bird-dispersed plant. This seedfall pattern, in turn, is central to the understanding of the spatial patterns of plant recruitment and the efficiency of the dispersal mutualism.

AB In studies of avian nesting success, it is often of interest to estimate stage-specific daily survival probabilities of nests. When data can be partitioned by nesting stage (e.g., incubation stage, nestling stage), piecewise application of the Mayfield method or Johnson's method is appropriate. However, when the data contain nests where the transition From one stage to the next occurred during the interval between visits, piecewise approaches are inappropriate. In this payer, I present a model that allows joint estimation of stage-specific daily survival probabilities even when the time of transition between stages is unknown. The model allows interval lengths between visits to nests to vary, and the exact time of failure of nests does not need to be known. The performance of the model at various sample sizes and interval lengths between visits was investigated using Monte Carlo simulations, and it was found that the: model performed quite well: bias was small and confidence-interval coverage was at the nominal 95% rate. A SAS program for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of parameters, and their standard errors, is provided in the Appendix.

AB Plant resources, predators, and abiotic conditions represent three major factors that potentially influence insect herbivore abundance in terrestrial ecosystems. In nitrogen (N)-limited environments the potential for bottom-up (plant resource) control is strong because plant quality may limit herbivore abundance. However, extremes in abiotic conditions, such as temperature and moisture, can mask such effects. I tested these hypotheses in an 8-yr field experiment that measured responses of plants and grasshoppers (Orthoptera) to N addition and exclusion of bird predators in an N-limited old-field prairie in east-central Minnesota. Plant biomass increased by 150-400%, and plant tissue N increased by 78% in response to N addition of 17 g.m(-2)yr(-1). Total grasshopper density responded positively to N addition following warm years. However, multiple regressions suggested that grasshopper densities were related much more strongly to thermal conditions than to soil N. Bird exclusion yielded weak effects that varied over time and may have been influenced by compensatory responses of other grasshopper predators to bird exclosures. Grasshopper feeding guilds differed in the relationship between their in vivo drymatter digestibility (DMD) and plant tissue N, and this physiological difference explained their drastically different responses to N addition. Plant quality (in vivo DMD) increased with plant tissue N for mixed-feeding grasshoppers, and accordingly, their density was positively correlated with soil N. Plant quality did not change with plant tissue N for grass feeders, and their densities were negatively correlated with soil N. Both guilds responded positively to warmer thermal conditions, but mixed-feeder densities were negatively related to previous year's precipitation, and grass-feeder densities were not affected by precipitation. These results support the hypothesis that bottom-up influences of insect herbivores can be important in N-limited systems but do not support the hypothesis that more productive environments necessarily support greater top-down influences. Thermal conditions may interact with or eliminate bottom-up effects. Furthermore, different guilds within the herbivore trophic level may be influenced differently by N addition, predators, and abiotic conditions. These results suggest that exploring the mechanisms of interaction between abiotic and trophic influences within components of food webs is likely to yield many new insights into the regulation of herbivore communities.

AB We examined intraspecific variation in susceptibility to herbivory by common ringtail possums (Pserrdocheirus peregrinus) for two species of Eucalyptus, (E. polyanthemos and E. sideraxylon) and the chemical basis for that variation. Using a no-choice protocol, we observed dry matter intakes by common ringtail possums ranging from 3.28 to 44 g.(kg body mass)(-0.75).d(-1) for E. polyanthemos and from 2.4 to 67 g(kg body mass)-0.75 d(-1) for E. sideroxylon. We investigated, using correlative analyses, the relationships between dry matter intake and a range of foliage chemical characteristics, including measures of nutritional quality (total nitrogen, cellulose, hemi-cellulose, lignin, in vitro dry matter digestibility) and plant secondary chemistry (total phenolics, condensed tannins, cyanogenic glycosides, terpenes, and sideroxylonal, a recently identified Eucalyptus toxin). Significant relationships were identified only for terpenes (and 1,8-cineole in particular) and sideroxylonal. Bioassay experiments confirmed that the foliar concentration of sideroxylonal alone was sufficient to explain the variation observed. To undertake a field study of variation in foliar sideroxylonal and dry matter intake by possums of E. polyanthemos, we developed calibrations of both variables against the near infrared spectra of foliage samples. Acceptable calibration equations were developed, and we applied these to samples collected from a number of E. polyanthemos individuals within an area approximating the home range size of common ringtail possums. We found that foliar sideroxylonal varied from nil to 12.6 mg/g, while predicted dry matter intakes by possums ranged from nil to 42.8 g (kg body mass)(-0.75.d-1), We conclude that significant patchiness in nutritional quality of foliage, resulting from variation in foliar concentrations of a single compound, exists at a scale relevant to the feeding decisions of individual animals.

AB The degree to which a variable's dynamics are synchronized among a set of neighboring lakes indicates the relative influence of regional climate variability. Furthermore, by determining which lakes tend to be most synchronous in their response to climate we can deduce the primary ways that climate influences the dynamics of the variable in question. In this study, we look for evidence of synchrony in the temperature, calcium, and chlorophyll dynamics of seven neighboring northern Wisconsin lakes. Our goals were to assess the influence of climate on dynamics of these variables and the effect of lake basin properties on their response to climate signals. Synchrony was measured as the r(2) value from a regression relating observations of a variable in one lake against simultaneous observations of the same variable in another. Temperature was the most synchronous variable, with all pairs displaying significant synchrony, Calcium was also highly synchronous, with 15 of the 21 lake pairs exhibiting significant synchrony. Chlorophyll was significantly synchronous for 11 of the 21 lake pairs, but only three pairs exhibited r(2) > 0.50. Lakes that were most similar in water clarity and average epilimnetic depth were most synchronous in temperature. Calcium was most synchronous among lakes occupying similar positions in the: groundwater how system, as expected from the control of calcium by groundwater flow paths. Synchrony of chlorophyll was highest for lakes with similar degrees of thermal stratification, suggesting that internal supplies of nutrients are an important determinant of interannual variability. The importance of ground- or bogwater flow to interannual chlorophyll dynamics is also suggested by the systematic asynchrony of chlorophyll for the clear-water lake that receives the least groundwater discharge. Our results show that climate imposes a strong synchrony on the behavior of three very different properties of the study lakes. Furthermore, the lakes differed predictably in their response to the same regional climate trends. Surprisingly, the differences between average synchrony observed for the three variables we considered were largely due to the diversity of the study lakes, rather than the disproportionate sensitivity of chlorophyll to local stochastic effects.

AB Parents should adjust expenditure on parental care so as to maximize fitness, but quantitative data are sparse, particularly for sexually dimorphic species. We use data from two breeding seasons to investigate the fitness consequences of variation in parent provisioning behavior and chick growth in a sexually dimorphic seabird, the Wandering Albatross (Diomedea exulans). Male parents brought more food to their single offspring than females did, and male chicks (sons) received more food than female chicks (daughters). The study of growth parameters indicates that sons had faster growth rates, reached higher asymptotic mass, and were heavier and larger at hedging than daughters. Male chicks that survived to adult age were larger than those that disappeared, whereas the females that survived were those in better condition at hedging, indicating that different factors affect survival of each sex during the first years of independence at sea. Survival to adult age seems to be influenced by the ability of parents to provision the offspring adequately, especially in the case of male chicks, whose costs appear to be higher. The age and experience of parents did not influence the amount of food delivered to the chick, but older birds rearing male chicks were more synchronized on a within-pair basis than younger parents, and consequently their sons grew faster, attaining both higher asymptotic mass and higher mass at fledging. Old adult males appeared to have a higher mortality rate than younger males when rearing a son. There was no such tendency for adult males rearing a daughter or for females rearing a son. Younger, less experienced pairs may tend to produce more sons than daughters when compared to older and more experienced pairs. If valid, this tendency for an age-related sex ratio could be the result of higher costs of raising the more expensive sex. These findings indicate that the optimal age-related investment by parents varies between males and females but also depends to a large degree on whether they are rearing a son or a daughter.

AB The effect of single-tree influence areas on the physicochemical properties of the soil surface mineral horizon (0-18 cm) was studied in three stands of Pinus radiata D. Don introduced into Sierra de la Ventana, Argentina, grasslands 50 yr ago. Soil samples were taken at distances of 0, 1, and 2 m in transects from the tree to the periphery of the crown. Adjacent grassland soils with mollic epipedons were used as controls. Soil alteration was found to be highest near the trunk, with clear evidence of acid hydrolysis of primary silicates; the epipedon close to the trunk was classified as umbric rather than mollic. Decreasing values of pH, Ca, and exchangeable Mg, and increasing values of exchangeable H and Al, and also of fulvic acid-complexed Al, were registered from the grassland toward the axes of the trees. The soil properties analyzed fall into a distinctive spatial pattern of radial symmetry around each individual tree, with systematic and predictable variations, thus confirming the validity of the concept of "single-tree influence circles" for the study area. Each stand of P. radiata generates a patch of soil alteration within the undisturbed habitat matrix; the internal structure of these patches shows a radial pattern of different polypedons spatially and genetically associated with the inner ring of bark litter and the outer ring of leaf and twig litter. The present work shows that the introduction of P. radiata triggered changes in the evolutionary trend of the soils of such magnitude as to be reflected at the highest taxonomic level in soil taxonomy.

AB Tree plantations are an important component of tropical landscapes, providing wood, fuel, and perhaps carbon (C) sequestration. Primary production in wet tropical plantations is typically nutrient limited. In some Hawaiian Eucalyptus plantations, nitrogen (N) limitations to production are alleviated by intercropping N-fixing Albizia trees that may decrease available phosphorus (P). Thus, sustainable productivity and C sequestration may depend on species composition. We measured soil N and P availability and ecosystem N and C sequestration in a 17-yr-old replicated replacement series of Eucalyptus and Albizia in Hawaii. Species composition included pure plots of each species and four proportions of mixtures. Soil N availability increased with the proportion of Albizia in the plot, but soil P availability declined. Aboveground tree C accumulation showed a synergistic response to increasing percentage of Albizia, with the mixed stands having more tree C than pure stands of Eucalyptus or Albizia. In the top 50 cm of soil, total N and C increased linearly with percentage of Albizia. Stands with the highest percentage of Albizia had 230 g/m(2) mole soil N and 2000 g/m(2) more soil C than stands without Albizia. Stable C isotope analyses showed that increased soil C resulted from differences in both tree-derived C and "old" sugarcane-derived C. Deeper soil C (50-100 cm) was a substantial fraction (0.36) of total soil C but did not vary among treatments. Our results demonstrate that tree species effects on nutrient and C dynamics are not as simple as monocultures suggest. Mixed-species afforestation increased tree and soil C accrual over 17 years, and N inputs may increase soil C storage by decreasing decomposition.

AB A single trade-off between competitive ability and mortality has been shown to support an arbitrarily large number of species in models of interference competition in spatially structured populations. We show that this results not from spatial structure, but instead from the assumption that a small difference in mortality translates into a large difference in competitive ability. We present graphical criteria for recognizing functions that support one, two, or more species. High levels of coexistence in models of this form depend on a steep slope or a discontinuous second derivative of the function relating mortality to competitiveness. These criteria are identical to those in models of interference competition chat lack explicit spatial structure.

AB Co-occurring species may utilize vastly different strategies to cope with limited water resources, particularly in areas subjected to predictable and recurring drought. While these physiological responses have commonly been measured at the leaf level, in small seedlings, and integrated in fluxes of whole stands or watersheds, sap flux measurements in large trees have become a useful tool for monitoring transpiration of individual canopies over long time periods. In this study, sap flux (J(S)) was measured with constant heat sap flow gauges for co-occuning species which have been previously evaluated at the leaf level. Measurements were taken in a subalpine stand containing most of the dominant species of the central Rocky Mountains (Pinus contorta, Abies lasiocarpa, Populus tremuloides, and Pinus flexilis). Daily J(S) values were parabolically related to daytime average atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (D) in all species, with a broad range of maximum J(S) values occurring between 1.2 and 1.8 kPa. Populus tremuloides had the greatest increases in J(S) with increasing D, while Pinus contorta showed the lowest J(S). A decrease in maximum J(S) was observed for all species later in the season when soil moisture declined from 0.35 to 0.24 m(3)/m(3) at 0-45 cm. Late-season J(S) in A. lasiocarpa decreased 50% due to stomatal closure in response to the soil moisture deficit, regardless of daily D. In contrast, the Pinus species were sensitive to D, showing larger late-season reductions in J(S) on high than on low D days. Populus tremuloides showed less sensitivity to soil moisture than the other species, with relatively high J(S) continuing late into the season and intermediate change in the response of J(S) to D with decreasing soil moisture. Stand-level estimates of transpiration by plots dominated by Pinus contorta and A. lasiocarpa (2.6 +/- 0.6 mm/d) were found to be similar to plots dominated by Populus tremuloides (2.7 +/- 0.6 mm/d) despite the nearly fourfold higher leaf area indices for the conifers.

AB The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that temporal differences in food chain composition affect lower trophic levels not only directly, by predation and grazing, but also indirectly, by inducing avoidance behavior. In a field study, the recruitment rate from the sediments to water of two algal species (Gonyostomum semen and Peridinium sp.) was higher at low than at high biomass of herbivorous zooplankton. In complementary laboratory experiments, where abiotic conditions were standardized, the presence of live, as well as dead, herbivores reduced the recruitment rate of both Gondostomum semen and Peridinium sp. These results suggest that some algal species are able to adjust their recruitment behavior in response to the likely risk of being grazed. Together with morphological adaptations (e.g., spines and large size) common among many algal species, such an induced behavioral response is an important adaptation to reduce cell mortality. As shown in this study, this behavioral response may have a profound impact on dominance and succession patterns in algal communities. The high zooplankton biomass observed during the first year of the held study was caused by failed reproduction of the dominant fish species in the lake (roach. Rutilus rutilus). Hence, food chain interactions (low predation on zooplankton, leading to high biomass of herbivorous zooplankton) may act in concert with more indirect, predator-avoidance behavior in structuring the phytoplankton community.

AB We developed a simulation method, known as life-stage simulation analysis (LSA) to measure potential effects of uncertainty and variation in vital rates on population growth (lambda) for purposes of species conservation planning. Under LSA, we specify plausible or hypothesized levels of uncertainty, variation, and covariation in vital rates fur a given population. We use these data under resampling simulations to establish random combinations of vital rates for a large number of matrix replicates and finally summarize results from the matrix replicates to estimate potential effects of each vital rate on lambda in a probability-based context. Estimates of potential effects are based on a variety of summary statistics, such as frequency of replicates having the same vital rate of highest elasticity, difference in elasticity values calculated under simulated conditions vs, elasticities calculated using mean invariant vital rates, percentage of replicates having positive population growth, and variation in lambda explained by variation in each vital rate. To illustrate, we applied LSA to viral rates for two vertebrates: desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) and Greater prairie Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido). Results fur the prairie chicken indicated that a single vital rate consistently had greatest effect on population growth. Results for desert tortoise, however, suggested that a variety of life stages could have strong effects on population growth. Additional simulations for the Greater Prairie Chicken under a hypothetical conservation plan also demonstrated that a variety of vital rates could be manipulated to achieve desired population growth. To improve the reliability of inference, we recommend that potential effects of vital rates on lambda be evaluated using a probability-based approach like LSA. LSA is an important complement to other methods that evaluate vital-rate effects on lambda, including classical elasticity analysis, retrospective methods of variance decomposition, and simulation of the effects of environmental stochasticity.

AB The design and objective of a community study imply the selection of the appropriate ordination technique in terms of species response models and weighting options. In this paper, we start from the observation that existing two-table ordination techniques and related measures of niche breadth inevitably weight a sample in proportion to its abundance. We introduce a new multivariate method, which gives a more even weight to all sampling units, including those which are species poor or individual poor. We use this new method of analysis which we call OMI (for Outlying Mean Index) to address the question of niche separation and niche breadth. The Outlying Mean Index, or species marginality, measures the distance between the mean habitat conditions used by species (species centroid), and the mean habitat conditions of the sampling area (origin of the niche hyperspace), and OMI analysis places species along habitat conditions using a maximization of their mean OMI. Therefore, the position of the species depends on their niche deviation from a reference, which represents neither the mean nor the most abundant species, but a theoretical ubiquitous species that tolerates the most general habitat conditions (i.e., a hypothetical species uniformly distributed among habitat conditions). We demonstrate that OMI analysis is well suited for the investigation of multidimensional niche breadths in the case of strong limiting factors (e.g., meteorological conditions) or strong driving fortes (e.g., longitudinal stream gradient). Furthermore, the analysis helps in finding which ecological factors are most important for community structure and organization and provides a separation of species based on their niche characteristics.

AB A 35-year controlled burning experiment in Minnesota oak savanna showed that fire frequency had a great impact on ecosystem carbon (C) stores. Specifically, compared to the historical fire regime, fire suppression led to an average of 1.8 Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1) of C storage, with most carbon stored in woody biomass. Forest floor carbon stores were also significantly impacted by fire frequency, but there were no detectable effects of fire suppression on carbon in soil and fine roots combined, or in woody debris. Total ecosystem C stores averaged similar to 110 Mg/ha in stands experiencing presettlement fire frequencies, but similar to 220 Mg/ha in stands experiencing fire suppression. If comparable rates of C storage were to occur in other ecosystems in response to the current extent of fire suppression in the United States, fire suppression in the USA might account for 8-20% of missing global carbon.

AB Knowledge of the direction, magnitude, and timing of changes in bird population abundance is essential to enable species of priority conservation concern to be identified, and reasons for the population changes to be understood. We give a brief review of previous techniques fur the analysis of large-scale survey data and present a new approach based on generalized additive models (GAMs). GAMs are used to model trend as a smooth, nonlinear function of time, and they provide a framework for testing the statistical significance of changes in abundance. In addition, the secund derivatives of the modeled trend curve may be used to identify key years in which the direction of the population trajectory was seen to change significantly. The inclusion of covariates into models for population abundance is also discussed and illustrated, and tests for the significance of covariate terms are given. We apply the methods to data from the Common Birds Census of the British Trust for Ornithology for 13 species of farmland birds. Seven of the species are shown to have experienced statistically significant declines since the mid-1960s, Two species exhibited a significant increase. The population trajectories of all but three species turned downward in the 1970s, although in most cases the 1980s brought either some recovery or a decrease in the rate of decline. The majority of populations have remained relatively stable in the 1990s. The results are comparable with those from other analysis techniques, although the new approach is shown to have advantages in generality and precision. We suggest extensions of the methods and make recommendations for the design of future surveys.

AB Historical events have been used to explain a wide range of phenomena including geographical distributions of species, community diversity, and population structure. At the level of individuals, historical effects in which past conditions influence future performance are particularly likely to occur in long-lived organisms that store resources between seasons and that form organs months or years before their elaboration. Such carryover mechanisms have been documented in several perennial plant species, but the implications for population processes are poorly known. In this study, I examine how the history of individuals influences their future performance, population dynamics, and life cycle structure in the long-lived herb Lathyrus vernus. Overall effects of plant history on population dynamics, in terms of growth rate, reproductive values, stable stage distribution, and elasticities, are examined by comparing an ordinary first-order matrix model with a second-order matrix model. In the latter, not only the present state of individuals, but also their past state is allowed to influence future fate.
   The results demonstrate that the history of individuals is sometimes important in models of population dynamics. Plant size change over a one-year period was negatively correlated among time intervals. Addition of the previous year's stage in population models shifted the growth rate from positive (lambda = 1.010) td negative (lambda = 0.986) and increased the proportion of small established individuals in the stable stage distribution. If historical effects are due to a capacity to buffer environmental variation and regain size or state, as in L. vernus, then recruitment contributes less and stasis more to population growth than suggested by ahistorical models. The presence of historical effects at the level of individuals, in any form, may have important consequences for population development and should be included in any interpretation of the life-cycle structure.

AB The spatial display of fire over time on the landscape is ecologically important, and spatially explicit analyses offer a possibility of revealing anthropogenic influence on fire regimes. Nonetheless few such analyses have been attempted for longer time frames. We identified past fires in a northern Swedish boreal landscape using fire scars on Pinus sylvestris trees. Within a 19 X 32 km area, local fin chronologies were established at 203 points by cross-dating fire scars on 1133 wood samples, the earliest dating back to the 1100s. A total of 349 separate fires were identified to location and size. The estimated number of fires per unit area and time (after correcting for varying sample density over time) was relatively constant at 0.095 fires.(10(4) ha)(-1).yr(-1) from 1350 to 1650. It increased gradually thereafter, except for a low period in the early 1700s, peaked at 1.17 fires (10(4) ha)(-1) yr(-1) in the mid-1800s, and then dropped dramatically after 1860. The proportion of the area burned per unit time also increased after 1650, in parallel with the increase in the number of fires (although much less strongly due to a counteracting trend in fire size), from an annual rate of 0.8% prior to 1650 to 2.8% in the mid-1800s. Prior to 1650, 90% of the total burned area was due to fires larger than 1000 ha, compared to 55% after 1650. This decrease in fire size with increasing number of fires may be an intrinsic property of the system: a negative feedback caused by lack of fuel in early succession. Fire intervals shorter than 15 yr were rare, and there was an increase in the hazard of burning during the first 3-5 decades after fire, suggesting an effect of fuel accumulation. Thus, the proportion of the area burned per unit time does not increase linearly with the number of fires in the landscape, because the probability that fires will stop at boundaries with recently burned areas increases over fires.
   The changes in the number of fires per unit time mirror changes in the cultural use of the land, i.e., the gradual expansion of permanent settlements in the area after the late 1600s. They are not explained by changes in climate records. This suggests that the increase in fire numbers from the second half of the 1600s represents an increase in anthropogenic fires. Before 1650, the number of fires detected per unit area and time was only marginally different from the present-day density of lightning ignitions in the region (similar to 0.1 fires (10(4) ha)(-1) yr(-1)), whereas during the mid 1800s it was 11.7 times higher.
   These results show that large alterations in the fire regime can occur without substantial changes in the proportion of area burned per unit time, as exemplified by the trend after 1650, when there were concurrent changes in the number of fires and in average fire size. Therefore, the number of fire events per unit area and time should be an important variable in the analysis of fire history and its underlying causes.

AB Host nests are the key habitat for ectoparasite species that live and reproduce within the nest material. Nest properties can influence host and parasite reproductive success, and therefore the outcome of host-parasite interactions, as well as the composition of parasite communities. Previous correlational results suggested that nest humidity may increase the negative effect of fleas on Great Tit (Parus major) reproductive success. Since the causality of the relationship was unknown, we simultaneously manipulated both hen flea (Ceratophyllus gallinae) infestation and nest humidity in order to investigate: (1) the effect of flea infestation on nest humidity, (2) the effect of nest humidity on the prevalence of flea infestations, (3) the effect of nest humidity on adult flea survival and reproduction, (4) the interaction between Rea infestations and nest humidity on Great Tit reproductive performance. and (5) the effect of both factors on secondary infestations by ectoparasitic Protocalliphora Hies. The present study provides the first example of an ectoparasite acting as a physical ecosystem engineer where nest humidity increased as a result of flea infestations. In experimentally uninfested nests, infestation of hosts by immigrant fleas was more frequent in nests with reduced humidity, in experimentally infested nests, manipulation of humidity did not significantly affect the number of adult fleas or larvae. Hen flea infestation reduced Great Tit nestling body mass, tarsus length, and wing length, as well as the number of young Hedged. The detrimental effect of the fleas on Great Tit reproduction was not altered by our modifications of nest humidity. The effect of fleas on nestling growth parameters and the number young hedged did not vary significantly with the seasonal decrease in reproductive performance of the birds, or with the number of young in the brood. The prevalence of secondary infestations by Protocalliphora was higher in nests with reduced humidity, and in nests experimentally infested with fleas. The numbers of Protocalliphora pupae were lower in flea-infested nests. This study provides the first experimental evidence that an abiotic factor within nests can affect ectoparasite infracommunity structure. It also provides the first evidence for an interspecific association between two ectoparasite species.

AB We reexamined geographic factors explaining the number of plant species on islands in the Galapagos Archipelago. We hypothesized that plant species richness (S) was related to the number of source pools and that plant species dispersal preferentially followed direct, oceanic pathways. To test different dispersal pathways from multiple source pools, the total number of islands within a given dispersal radius (i) was posed as the sum of the number of line-of-sight islands (C-i) and of the number of islands without line-of-sight connection (B-i). In partial regression analyses, controlling for nearest island area (A(2)) and for recipient island elevation (E) and area (InA), C-i and C-i x E were found to be positively correlated with S in the Galapagos for nearly all dispersal ranges from 10 km to 419 km (maximum inter-island separation). In contrast, B-i x E was negatively correlated with S at the longest dispersal ranges. The connectivity index, C-i, multiplied by elevation, E, explained more variation in S in the Galapagos than prior regression models using additive forms of E, InA, A(2), and isolation from the central island. Using the variables C-i x E and InA, multiple-regression models explained >90% of the variance in both endemic and total plant species richness in the Galapagos Archipelago.

AB Large-scale changes in climate may have unexpected effects on ecosystems, given the importance of climate as a control over almost all ecosystem attributes and internal feedbacks. Changes in plant community productivity or composition, for example, may alter ecosystem resource dynamics, trophic structures, or disturbance regimes, with subsequent positive or negative feedbacks on the plant community. At northern latitudes, where increases in temperature are expected to be greatest but where plant species diversity is relatively low, climatically mediated changes in species composition or abundance will likely have large ecosystem effects. In this study, we investigated effects of infrared loading and manipulations of water-table elevation on net primary productivity of plant species in bog and fen wetland mesocosms between 1994 and 1997.
   We removed 27 intact soil monoliths (2.1 m(2) surface area, 0.5-0.7 m depth) each from a bog and a fen in northern Minnesota to construct a large mesocosm facility that allows for direct manipulation of climatic variables in a replicated experimental design. The treatment design was a fully crossed factorial with three infrared-loading treatments, three water-table treatments, and two ecosystem types (bogs and fens), with three replicates of all treatment combinations. Overhead infrared lamps caused mean monthly soil temperatures to increase by 1.6-4.1 degreesC at 15-cm depth during the growing season (May-October). In 1996, depths to water table averaged -11, -19, and -26 cm in the bog plots, and 0, -10, and -19 cm in the fen plots.
   Annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of bryophyte, forb, graminoid, and shrub life-forms was determined for the dominant species in the mesocosm plots based on species specific canopy/biomass relationships. Belowground net primary production (BNPP) was estimated using root in-growth cores.
   Bog and fen communities differed in their response to infrared loading and water-table treatments because of the differential response of life-forms and species characteristic of each community. Along a gradient of increasing water-table elevation, production of bryophytes increased, and production of shrubs decreased in the bog community. Along a similar gradient in the fen community, production of graminoids and forbs increased. Along a gradient of in creasing infrared loading in the bog, shrub production increased whereas graminoid production decreased. In the fen, graminoids were most productive at high infrared loading, and forbs were most productive at medium infrared loading. In the bog and fen, BNPP:ANPP ratios increased with warming and drying, indicating shifts in carbon allocation in response to climate change.
   Further, opposing responses of species and life-forms tended to cancel out the response of production at higher levels of organization, especially in the bog. For example, total net primary productivity in the bog did not differ between water-table treatments because BNPP was greatest in the dry treatment whereas ANPP was greatest in the wet treatment.
   The differential responses of species, life-forms, and above- and belowground biomass production to the treatments suggest that bog and fen plant communities will change, in different directions and magnitudes, in response to warming and changes in water-table elevation. Further, results of this and complementary research indicate that these peatlands may mediate their energy, carbon, and nutrient budgets through differential responses of the plant communities. Thus, predictions of the response of peatlands to changes in climate should consider differences in plant community structure, as well as biogeochemistry and hydrology, that characterize and differentiate these two ecosystems.

AB Many small mammal species may exhibit source-sink dynamics, in which some patches (sources) are occupied mainly by residents, while others (sinks) are occupied mainly by recent immigrants. Residents and immigrants are expected to differ in their degree of familiarity with their surroundings, which could affect resource use. Small mammals are known to inhibit the establishment of tree seedlings, especially when population densities are high, and habitat quality, especially the availability of cover and food, has been found to affect local densities. In addition, availability of food can affect the use of other food items, especially those of lower quality. Our goals were to study how population status (residents vs, immigrants) affects use of habitat patches differing in cover and food availability, and how the quality of habitats and individuals interact and affect tree-seedling predation by meadow votes (Microtus pennsylvanicus). We conducted a field experiment in six 40 m x 40 m enclosures in an old field. The enclosed populations were randomized into resident vs. immigrant treatments and exposed to a habitat manipulation treatment (cover vs. food) using a 2 x 2 factorial design within the enclosures. We planted seedlings of red maple (Acer rubrum) and black birch (Betula lenta) in each habitat patch and censused them for three weeks. Seedling predation was lower in food-supplemented than in nonsupplemented patches. Voles were attracted by cover and killed more seedlings within it than in open patches. Immigrants moved more between habitat patches than residents. When controlling for the number of visitors to patches, the immigrants killed fewer seedlings than did the residents. This study demonstrates that spatial dynamics of animal consumers, such as source-sink movements between habitat patches, can influence community dynamics of plants, such as the invasion of old fields by trees, in ways beyond those predicted by simple numerical relationships between consumers and resources.

AB This article used a series of simple models to examine the population dynamics of two independently reproducing resource populations in spatially distinct patches, when the resources are eaten by a fixed consumer population that moves adaptively between the patches. The models assumed that each resource (patch) experienced a potentially different set of environmental influences on its growth rate. The models also assumed that consumer distribution shifted more rapidly toward the more rewarding patch as the difference in resource intake rates between the patches increased. In most cases, the time-average of spatial heterogeneity of resource densities is greatest for intermediate rates of consumer movement. The average resource densities and consumer fitness are also frequently maximal when movement rates are intermediate. Intermediate movement rates allow enough of a lag in consumer redistribution that resources periodically escape overexploitation. Resource densities and heterogeneity may increase by a large factor as the rate of consumer movement (or the sensitivity of consumer movement to differences in intake rates) increases. These findings were used to discuss the potential effects of predators that interfere with habitat selection by their prey. Such predators may have positive or negative effects on the density of their prey and of their prey's resources. Predators may also either increase or decrease the spatial heterogeneity of resource densities.

AB How should plant ecologists scale up from the fine-scale events affecting individual plants in small neighborhoods to the coarse-scale dynamics of plant communities? We give here a dynamical system, derived from an individual-based model, that captures the main effects of spatial structure. The individual-based model describes a multispecies plant community, living in a spatial domain, containing plants that (1) reproduce and die with rates that depend on other individuals in a specified neighborhood, and (2) move through seed dispersal and clonal growth. Over the course Of time, substantial spatial structure can build up in such a community due to local interactions and dispersal. The dynamical system describes how the structure of local neighborhoods changes over time, using the first and second spatial moments of the individual-based model. We show, by means of an example of two competing species, that the dynamical system gives a close approximation to the behavior of the underlying individual-based model and that the changes in local spatial structure as time progresses have fundamental effects on the dynamics.

AB The ability to enter torpor at low ambient temperature, which enables insectivorous bats to survive seasonal food shortage, is often seen as a prerequisite for colonizing cold environments. Free-tailed bats (Molossidae) show a distribution with a maximum latitudinal extension that appears to be intermediate between truly tropical and temperate-zone bat families. We therefore tested the hypothesis that Tadarida teniotis, the molossid species reaching the highest latitude worldwide (46 degrees N), lacks the extreme physiological adaptations to cold that enable other sympatric bats to enter further into the temperate zone. We studied the metabolism of individuals subjected to various ambient temperatures in the laboratory by respirometry, and we monitored the body temperature of free-ranging individuals in winter and early spring in the Swiss Alps using temperature-sensitive radio-tags. For comparison, metabolic data were obtained from Nyctalus noctula, a typically hibernating vespertilionid bat of similar body size and convergent foraging tactics. The metabolic data support the hypothesis that T. teniotis cannot experience such low ambient temperatures as sympatric temperate-zone vespertilionid bats without incurring much higher energetic costs for thermogenesis. The minimum rate of metabolism in torpor was obtained at 7.5 degrees-10 degrees C in T. teniotis, as compared to 2.5 degrees-5 degrees C in N. noctula. Field data showed that T. teniotis behaves as a classic thermo-conforming hibernator in the Alps, with torpor bouts lasting up to 8 d. This contradicts the widely accepted opinion that Molossidae are nonhibernating bars. However, average body temperature (10 degrees-13 degrees C) and mean arousal frequency (3.4 d in one bat in January) appear to be markedly higher than in other temperate-zone bat species. At the northern border of its range T. teniotis selects relatively warm roosts (crevices in tall, south-exposed limestone cliffs) in winter where temperatures oscillate around 10 degrees C. By this means, T. teniotis apparently avoids the risk of prolonged exposure to energetically critical ambient temperatures in torpor (<6.5 degrees-7.5 degrees C) during cold spells. Possibly shared by other Molossidae, the physiological pattern observed in T. teniotis may clearly be linked to the intermediate latitudinal extension of this bat family.

AB The generalist feeding strategy of larvae of the western tree hole mosquito, Aedes sierrensis, is central to understanding the community-level effects of the tritrophic interactions among mosquito larvae, midsized organisms (such as protozoa), and lower-level organisms (such as bacteria and fungi) in west coast phytotelmata. Laboratory microcosm experiments were conducted to characterize the feeding strategies of Ae. sierrensis larvae in the presence of multiple resource types (free-swimming protozoa and substrate-bound particulate material). In our experiment, we quantified the effects of varying instar numbers and profile, resource type, and refuge size on predation of protozoa. Refugia were explicitly modeled in our microcosms, representing the interstitial spaces of leaf litter and the wood lining of natural tree holes. Results from these microcosm experiments suggested that: (1) Even in the absence of larvae, the majority of protozoa resided in the small-volume, resource-rich refugia. There was, however, a strong nonlinear and negative relationship between larval densities in the upper compartment and the protozoan densities in the refuge, suggesting that there was continual movement of protozoa between the two spaces. (2) Fourth instars harvested resources by filter-feeding at a higher rate than second instars. (3) As the level of substrate-bound particulate food was increased, the predation pressure by filter-feeding on the protozoa decreased. (4) As the refuge volume increased, the predation pressure on the protozoa decreased.
   We constructed a three-state-variable mathematical model describing the generalist feeding behavior of Ae. sierrensis larvae. The model system, with constant predator densities and two prey groups, exhibited full cooperativity; i.e., an increase in protozoa density resulted in a shift toward predation by filter feeding, while an increase in substrate-bound resources resulted in a shift toward predation by browsing. This indirect mutualism is mechanistically distinct from previously published systems and provides a potential mechanism for protozoan persistence in the presence of larval predation.

AB We describe a new approach to determining the age structure of seed banks of natural plant populations and apply it to a natural population of the Sonoran Desert winter annual, Pectocarya recurvata (Boraginaceae). Unlike other C-14 techniques, tandem accelerator mass spectrometry (TAMS) counts the number of carbon isotope atoms, permitting high precision with small samples. Aboveground nuclear bomb tests caused atmospheric C-14 levels to peak in 1963. Their subsequent gradual decline provides a signal for aging seed banks with TAMS. We constructed a calibration curve using seeds with known dates of production during 1980-1995, then used it to age 53 seeds sampled from a natural seed bank in 1993, at the Desert Laboratory in Tucson, Arizona. Seed number declined with age at an approximately exponential rate, with the oldest recovered seed having an estimated age of 5 yr (95% cr = +/-2.3 yr). The seed bank age structure was judged more than adequate to buffer this population from typical fluctuations, based on an examination of 15 yr of population dynamic data. The TAMS technique has strong potential for answering a broad range of ecological and evolutionary questions requiring post-1963 age determinations and for which a several-year confidence interval is acceptable.

AB Lateral shading of direct-beam irradiation among neighboring canopy tree crowns in a nonequatorial tropical rain forest canopy was modeled as a function of solar position using a photogrammetric database derived from large-scale color aerial stereopairs (1:1500-1:3000 scale) acquired in 1976. The interception of direct-beam irradiation by the orthogonally projected crown area of each tree was computed at hourly intervals over a full calendar year using a Parameterization model of cloud-attenuated direct-beam availability. The annual totals of intercepted direct-beam irradiation (I-b) ranged from 1.81 to 4.13 GJ.m(-2).yr(-1). Expressed as a percentage of the available incident direct-beam irradiation, these values ranged from 44% to 100%. Approximately 20% of the sample population intercepted <70% of the available annual direct-beam irradiation. The long-term effects of lateral shading and the intertree differences in I-b were assessed using repeat aerial stereophotography of the same section of forest 18 yr later in 1994 for the determination of the mortality, survivorship, and crown growth of the canopy trees delimited in the 1976 stereopairs. Mortality over the 18-yr period amounted to 27.2%. Based on the lateral shading simulations, the mean annual I-b totals of the survivors and those that died were significantly different (P < 0.001). Approximately 40% of the survivors experienced crown area reductions. Although there was no significant difference in the I-b of survivors with crown growth and those with crown reductions, a relationship was established between I-b and the extent of crown area change. Canopy trees that intercept the most direct-beam irradiation and experience the least lateral shading have higher probabilities of survivorship and significant crown area changes that may be in the form of crown growth or crown reduction. Their laterally shaded neighbors have a lower survivorship probability, and those that survive persist in an inhibited state with limited crown area change. We conclude that the effects of lateral shading are not limited to the margins of treefall gaps and that lateral shading determined by crown position in the uneven upper canopies of nonequatorial tropical rain forests has a detectable effect on the long-term fates of neighboring canopy trees.

AB Texas ebony (Chloroleucon ebano) has recently been introduced as an ornamental tree in the Phoenix metropolitan area of Arizona (USA). It has since been colonized by the seed beetle Stator limbatus (Coleoptera: Bruchidae), and seeds of Texas ebony support the development of beetles to reproductive maturity in nature and in the laboratory. Egg size affects the larval survivorship of beetles on seeds of Texas ebony. Females of S. limbatus exhibit egg-size plasticity in response to native host plants; they lay small eggs if they encounter seeds of catclaw acacia (Acacia greggii) and lay large eggs if they encounter seeds of the blue paloverde (Cercidium floridum). We tested the hypothesis that oviposition experiences of female S. limbatus on native plants affects the ability of their larvae to develop on seeds of the nonnative Texas ebony. We demonstrate that females that encounter the native C. floridum while they are maturing their eggs produce progeny that have survivorship 10 times higher on seeds of the introduced Texas ebony than that of progeny produced by females that do not encounter C. floridum during egg maturation. However, this result cannot be explained entirely by egg-size plasticity; survivorship of larvae differed among treatments even in the range of egg sizes that overlapped between treatments. These results thus indicate that females exhibit plasticity in egg size and egg composition, and that this plasticity facilitates the expansion of S. limbatus onto seeds of a nonnative plant. Our study thus demonstrates that maternal effects can influence species interactions within communities, and that we should consider these maternal effects when predicting the ecological and evolutionary consequences of changing species distributions.

AB Plant resistance to herbivores is affected both by genetic and environmental factors. The carbon-nutrient balance hypothesis (CNB) explains environmentally induced variation in both constitutive and delayed herbivore-induced resistance (DIR) in terms of variation in soil fertility and light regime. The CNB hypothesis predicts that an increase in the availability of nutrients (e.g., fertilization) decreases both constitutive and induced resistance against herbivores. We tested the relative roles of plant genotype, defoliation, and soil fertility in determining herbivore resistance of cloned silver birch Betula pendula Roth saplings. As indicators of insect and mammalian resistance we conducted bioassays with a geometrid moth, Epirrita autumnata (Borkhausen), and counted the resin droplets on the shoot of the saplings, respectively. In addition, we measured rapid induced resistance (RIR) against the insect herbivore. Finally, we analyzed leaf secondary chemistry to investigate the correlations of secondary chemicals with the level of resistance measured using the performance of E. autumnata.
   With respect to the constitutive resistance against an insect herbivore, our results support the CNB hypothesis; the larvae of E. autumnata had a higher relative growth rate and pupal mass on fertilized saplings compared to nonfertilized saplings, i.e., the fertilized saplings had a lower resistance level. However, the relative growth rate of E. autumnata was significantly decreased by defoliation only when the larvae were grown on fertilized saplings. The number of resin droplets increased due to fertilization and, in fertilized saplings, following defoliation, but these responses were highly determined by the genotype of the sapling. Altogether, the results on resin droplets are not in accordance with the CNB hypothesis.
   The concentration of condensed tannins correlated negatively with E. autumnata growth rate and pupal mass in both fertilization levels, whereas the concentration of total nontannin phenolics correlated positively with the E. autumnata growth rate in nonfertilized saplings. In addition, the concentration of myricetin glycosides correlated negatively with the pupal mass of E. autumnata, whereas the correlations between E. autumnata performance indices and other groups of flavonol glycosides were either significantly positive (kaempferol glycosides) or nonsignificant (quercetin glycosides). Further, the concentration of 3,4'-dihydroxypropiophenone 3-glucoside (DHPPG) correlated positively with the magnitude of induction in E. autumnata growth rate and pupal mass in fertilized saplings, where the significant induction in resistance occurred. The correlations of secondary chemistry and E, autumnata performance indices suggest that the constitutive level of resistance of B. pendula against E. autumnata is mainly determined by the concentration of condensed tannins, whereas the induced resistance is determined by the concentration of nontannin phenolics, such as flavonol glycosides and DHPPG.
   We observed significant differences among the clones in their insect and mammalian resistance (i.e., genetic basis for the resistance), which indicates that resistance can evolve as a response to herbivory. However, fertilization explained a higher proportion of variance in insect performance indices than the genotype of the plant, whereas the opposite was true for the amount of resin droplets, which we used as an indicator of mammalian resistance.

AB Pollinator selectivity is thought to influence the evolution of separate sexes in plants because of its potential to limit plant reproductive success. Selective visitation could also constrain or promote the phenotypic divergence of the sexes. In this study, I explored the causes and consequences of selectivity by generalist pollinators of a gynodioecious wild strawberry (Fragaria virginiana) and thus provide insight into potential pollinator-mediated selection for dioecy and sexual dimorphism. I found that flowers of F. virginiana show pronounced sexual dimorphism in petal length, stamen length, nectar and pollen production, and that this results in dramatic and consistent levels of sex-differential visitation by ants, bees, and flies. I performed manipulations of hermaphrodite flowers to understand the basis of selectivity and found that much of bee and fly preference for hermaphrodite flowers derived from their strong preference for longer petals, but also from a more subtle preference for pollen-filled anthers. These studies also revealed that other traits contribute to the observed discrimination against females. A stronger relationship existed between bee visitation and pollen receipt in females than between bee visitation and pollen removal from hermaphrodites. An analysis of natural variation in petal and stamen length confirmed the central role of petal length and also showed a lack of an effect of vestigial stamen length in pollination success of females. It also revealed a significant effect of stamen length, but not of petal length, on pollen removal. The data suggest that pollinator selectivity may affect the evolution of floral sexual dimorphism, both by exerting selection that could lead to the maintenance of stamens in females and by exerting selection to increase petal length in females.

AB The banks of Brine Pool NR1, a brine-filled pockmark in the Gulf of Mexico, are host to a population of Bathymodiolus childressi, a hydrocarbon seep mussel with methanotrophic endosymbionts. The mussel community surrounds the pool, covering an area of similar to 540 m(2) and can be divided into two distinct zones separated by a transitional area. The inner zone extends inward from the edge of the pool similar to 1 m. The water among the mussels in this zone has high methane concentrations (>200 mu mol/L) and moderate oxygen concentrations (nondetectable to 161 mu mol/L). Hydrogen sulfide was rarely detected in this zone. The outer zone extends similar to 1 m inward from the outer edge of the mussel bed. This zone also has high methane concentrations in the water among the mussels (>200 mu mol/L), but lower average oxygen levels and areas with very high levels of hydrogen sulfide. The two zones are linked with a transitional area, the middle zone, ranging in width from 1 to 4 m, where intermediate environmental conditions are found. The inner zone was relatively homogenous, while spatial heterogeneity was high in the middle and outer zones, both in the characteristics of the mussel population and in their environment. Size-frequency distributions indicate that the inner zone is an area of active recruitment, with very little recruitment occurring in either the middle or outer zones, Physiological condition indices of the mussels were significantly higher in the inner zone than in the outer zone in some years. Comparisons of growth parameters also indicate better growth conditions in the inner zone. Physiological condition and growth did not change between the first two years of the study, However, a significant change in both was detected between 1994 and 1995, suggesting that this deep-sea community is exposed to an unexpected temporal variability in environmental conditions.

AB Ecologists recently have been focusing on the role that trait-mediated indirect effects can have on community structure and composition. To date, this work has primarily focused on the effects of predator-induced behavioral plasticity on communities. However, predator-induced morphological plasticity, which has been documented in many taxa, might also lead to trait-mediated indirect effects. Here, I examined how predators altered the behavior and morphology of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and leopard frogs (R. pipiens) and how these phenotypic changes altered the outcome of competition between the two species.
   Competition in the absence of caged predators was asymmetric; when reared separately, leopard frogs grew more than wood frogs, but when competing (without predators), wood frogs grew faster than leopard frogs. The presence of caged predators reversed the outcome of competition between the two anuran prey. In the presence of larval dragonflies (Anax spp.) or caged mudminnows (Umbra limi), leopard frogs grew faster than wood frogs while total tadpole biomass production remained unchanged. Thus, there was a predator-mediated indirect effect.
   Because predators alter both the behavior and morphology of larval anurans and both of these traits are known to affect resource consumption and growth, both are potential mechanisms to explain the change in competitive outcome. Changes in behavior were not related to changes in growth, but changes in morphology (specifically mouth width and tail length) were related to changes in growth. When competitors were added (without predators), wood frogs increased their mouth width by 10% and their tail length by 3%, while leopard frogs increased their mouth width by 5% and did not change their tail length. The greater increase in mouth width for wood frogs should increase their forage intake, since tadpoles feed by scraping periphyton; the importance of a 3% longer tail in competitive ability is unknown. The presence of the predator threat (via chemical cues from the caged predators) reduced both the mouth width and tail length in the two prey species to precompetition levels. This response corresponded with the reduced competitive ability of the wood frogs. This work demonstrates that both competitors and predators can alter prey morphology and suggests that changes in morphology can cause trait-mediated indirect effects.

AB Induced responses to herbivores are common and well documented in plants. It has been hypothesized that the evolutionary ecology of induced responses can be understood by studying benefits of induction in the presence of herbivores and costs of induction in the absence of herbivores. Phenotypic benefits and costs of induction would indicate that such plasticity in defense could be adaptive (i.e., that phenotypes matched to their environmental conditions have higher relative fitness than unmatched phenotypes). However, few studies to date have investigated the benefits and costs of induction in the same system. In this study, induced responses of Lepidium virginicum to herbivory reduced feeding by generalist noctuid caterpillars in choice and no-choice experiments. Induced plant responses to herbivory were correlated with an increase in the number of trichomes per leaf and an increase in the diversity of the putatively defensive chemical compounds, glucosinolates, present in the foliage of damaged plants compared to undamaged controls. Induction did not affect the feeding behavior of the larvae of the specialist butterfly, Pieris rapae.
   In field experiments, induction reduced natural colonization of plants by aphids compared to both unmanipulated controls and controls that were damaged (but not induced) by clipping a leaf from the plant using a pair of scissors. Induced plants were more likely to survive in the field than clipped plants, a result that suggests a net fitness benefit of induction when leaf tissue removal was controlled. In experiments conducted in the absence of herbivores, damage induced responses did not reduce the root or shoot biomass of plants grown at low density. At high plant density, induction was associated with both reduced root biomass and increased aboveground growth, suggesting that induction may cause an allocation shift, rather than a loss of total biomass. Induced responses of plants satisfy a necessary component of adaptive plasticity because plants in variable herbivore environments maximize relative fitness by adjusting their defensive phenotype.

AB The occupation of adjacent, nonoverlapping positions along environmental gradients by closely related and ecologically similar species has drawn considerable attention from many ecologists over the past decades. Condition-specific competition, wherein competitive superiority varies with the abiotic environmental gradient, has been proposed as the major structuring force behind such distributions. However, few studies have elucidated the underlying mechanisms, such as behavioral and demographic processes. We conducted laboratory experiments to examine the effects of temperature on interspecific competition between two stream salmonid fishes, Salvelinus malma and S. leucomaenis. The two species have a largely allopatric altitudinal distribution on Hokkaido Island, Japan, proposed to be the result of temperature-mediated competition. We tested predictions that at a higher temperature (12 degrees C), S. leucomaenis would dominate over S. malma in aggressive interactions, foraging performance, growth, and survival, but become subordinate at a lower temperature (6 degrees C). Indeed, S. leucomaenis initiated a greater number of aggressive acts, attained greater food intake and greater growth, and finally excluded S. malma at the higher temperature. Although the two species initiated a similar number of aggressive acts and foraged equally well at the lower temperature, S. leucomaenis achieved a higher growth rate than S. malma; however, the latter eventually became numerically dominant. Clear competitive release in allopatry occurred for S. malma only at the higher temperature, providing direct evidence of condition-specific asymmetric competition. The lower distribution boundary of S. malma in Hokkaido streams may therefore be determined by temperature-mediated condition-specific competition. However, mechanisms determining the upper distribution boundary of S. leucomaenis could not be fully explained by the competitive results at lower temperature, but required an understanding of how effects of competition interacted with species-specific physiological traits. Thus, species distributions along an environmental gradient cannot be solely explained by a simple model of condition-specific competition without considering mechanistic linkages among behavioral and physiological responses to the environment, resource use, and demographic processes.

AB Experimental work has established that vertebrates can have a large impact on the abundance of arthropods in temperate forest and grasslands, as well as on tropical islands. The importance of vertebrate insectivory has only rarely been evaluated for mainland tropical ecosystem. in this study, we used exclosures to measure the impact of birds on arthropods in Guatemalan coffee plantations. Variation in shade management on coffee farms provides a gradient of similar habitats that vary in the complexity of vegetative structure and floristics. We hypothesized that shaded coffee plantations, which support a higher abundance of insectivorous birds, would experience relatively greater levels of predation than would the sun coffee farms. We found a reduction (64-80%) in the number of large (> 5 mm in length) but not small arthropods in both coffee types which was consistent across most taxonomic groups and ecological guilds. We also found a small but significant increase in the frequency of herbivore damage on leaves in the exclosures. This level of predation suggests that birds may help in reducing herbivore numbers and is also consistent with food limitation for birds in coffee agroecosystems. However, the presence of shade did not have an effect on levels of insectivory.

AB Recently, numerous studies have pointed to the importance of positive interactions in natural communities. There is now a broad consensus that the balance between negative and positive interactions should shift along environmental gradients, with competition prevailing under environmentally benign conditions and positive interactions dominating under harsh conditions. A commonly cited example of the importance of facilitation in harsh environments is the preference of desert annual plants for the areas under the canopy of shrubs. The recognition of apparently positive effects of desert shrubs on annuals, however, has been mostly based on density measurements, while fitness parameters of the understory plants have been ignored. Also, the temporal consistency of such effects has not been previously tested. Based on conceptual ideas about the balance between interference and facilitation, we predicted that positive effects of the shrubs on the understory should dominate in dry years, while in favorable years, negative effects would be stronger. We tested our hypothesis by measuring the direction and magnitude of the shrub effect on demographic responses of four desert annual plant species during four consecutive seasons of differing rainfall. The results contradicted our initial hypothesis. Depending on the species, the effect of the shrubs shifted from either negative to neutral or from neutral to positive with increasing annual rainfall. However, this trend was stronger for the effect of shrubs on plant reproductive success than on their densities. Our data highlight the importance of measuring fitness parameters in studies of plant-plant interactions. We suggest that the negative effects of shrubs on plant fitness were due to rainfall interception, while positive effects were related to increased nutrient availability beneath shrubs. However, the mechanisms by which the shrubs and annuals interact can only be resolved using an experimental approach. Our results contradict previous hypotheses about the relative importance of positive and negative interactions along environmental gradients. A simple conceptual model summarizing the proposed role of rainfall in determining the direction of shrub effects on their understory annuals is presented.

AB Many forest-interior songbirds are considered "area sensitive" because they are absent from smaller forest remnants in fragmented landscapes, Reductions in food abundance with fragment size could explain area sensitivity, but to date, only one empirical study has investigated this possibility. From 1995 to 1997, we tested the food abundance hypothesis in two small (similar to 55-ha) and two large (>400-ha) forest fragments located in a matrix of agricultural land in northeastern New South Wales, Australia. We measured differences in food abundance by comparing the biomass of surface-dwelling invertebrates in large and small fragments. We also determined whether food supply was associated with foraging efficiency and reproductive performance in an area-sensitive, ground-foraging insectivore, the Eastern Yellow Robin (Eopsaltria australis), breeding at these same sites. Invertebrate biomass in the small fragments was about half of that in the large fragments. Incubating female robins received 40% less food from males, females left their nests more frequently to forage on their own, and nestlings were provisioned with less food in the small fragments. Females in the small fragments also had a shorter breeding season (by three weeks), laid eggs that were 7% lighter, and reared smaller nestlings. Because our measures of invertebrate biomass, foraging efficiency, and reproduction produced corresponding results, we conclude that Eastern Yellow Robins experienced relative food shortage in these small fragments. Therefore, food shortage probably influences area sensitivity in this species. We suggest that the role of food supply be given greater consideration in other fragmentation studies.

AB Rivers are increasingly fragmented by dams, resulting in disruption of natural dispersal pathways and subsequent changes of riverine communities. We assessed the effect of dams as barriers to plant dispersal along rivers by comparing the flora of vascular plants between pairs of run-of-river impoundments in northern Sweden. Adjacent impoundments in similar environmental settings develop different riparian floras because species with poor floating capacity become unevenly distributed among impoundments. Such discontinuities were not found along a free-flowing river, suggesting effective dispersal of riparian plants in the absence of dams. Given that dams regulate most of the world's rivers, floristic disruptions of riparian corridors may be a global phenomenon. The extensive fragmentation of other ecosystems may have caused similar obstructions to organism dispersal, with subsequent changes in species composition.

AB Females of the golden egg bug (Phyllomorpha laciniata) lay eggs on the backs of male and female conspecifics, and surprisingly, individuals commonly carry unrelated eggs. Here, we investigate predation risk from the ant Formica rufa during two reproductive stages of the golden egg bug: egg carrying and mating. Ants and an egg-loaded bug were enclosed with an unloaded bug, with a mating pair, or with a mating pair and an unloaded bug. Both mating and egg carrying increased predation risk. Mating increased predation risk because mating pairs were attacked more often than single egg-loaded bugs. When a mating pair was enclosed with an egg-loaded bug and an unloaded bug, the pair was attacked significantly more often than the two single individuals together, even though ant visitation rates did not differ among prey items. Ants attacked egg-loaded bugs significantly more often than unloaded bugs. Egg-loaded individuals suffered lower predation risks when in the presence of a mating pair than when in the presence of a single unloaded bug. Thus, predation risk depends on the mating status of nearby individuals. In the field, single individuals are often found with mating pairs; this observation could be explained if individuals decrease their predation risk by associating with preferred prey.

   NUMBER
AB Despite its potential importance as a source of fitness variation in natural plant populations, few studies have so far examined long-term patterns of individual differences in progeny viability under natural conditions. This paper reports on a six-year field study on the differences in progeny viability (defined here as the probability of seeds contributing an established, prereproductive juvenile to the population), and its two components (seedling emergence and seedling survivorship), for the Mediterranean evergreen shrub Lavandula latifolia. The main objectives of the study were (1) to assess whether individual plants actually differ in the viability of their progeny under natural conditions, and (2) to determine if naturally occurring levels of variation in viability may modify individual differences in fecundity. Seed progenies from 14 maternal parents belonging to one population were sown at 10 held sites differing broadly in habitat type and soil characteristics, and seedling emergence and survival subsequently were monitored for six years. Maternal parents differed significantly in progeny viability because of both differential seedling emergence and seedling survivorship, and variation in either of these parameters was not significantly related to maternal differences in seed size. Differences in seedling survivorship were more important than differences in seedling emergence as determinants of maternal variation in progeny viability.While individual differences in seedling emergence remained consistent across sowing sites, there was a strong parent x sowing site interaction on seedling survivorship, and the rank of maternal parents with regard to this Variable varied erratically among sowing sites. A significant inverse relationship existed across maternal parents between seed production and progeny viability, which was not mediated by differences in seed size, thus suggesting a trade-off between the number and quality of the progeny produced by L. latifolia plants. Although maternal differences in seed production were about twice as important as differences in progeny viability in determining maternal differences in juvenile recruitment, viability differences should not be disregarded a priori as unimportant sources of fitness differences. Results of this study stress the importance of conducting long-term, direct field assessments of individual differences in progeny viability across a range of environments encompassing the conditions actually faced by the species.

AB Many organisms occurring in temporally variable environments have evolved life-history traits that enable their populations to persist during unfavorable environmental conditions. Numerous terrestrial plants, insects, and marine invertebrates, for example, rely on resting stages that disperse their propagules in time. Although widely observed among many taxa, few examples exist for marine macroalgae, at least in part because of the methodology involved in studying them. Here, I determined that microscopic life stages of the annual marine macroalga Desmarestia ligulata overwinter during periods when the macroscopic thalli are absent, thereby allowing this species to persist in temporally variable environments. Examination of field-grown microscopic stages with fluorescence microscopy identified these stages as gametophytes. Holdfast tagging experiments determined that recruitment of the macroscopic stages was not enhanced by regrowth of perennial thalli as observed in other macroalgae, suggesting that overwintering gametophytes were the sole source of sporophyte recruitment. In contrast to true resting stages, Desmarestia gametophytes were not dormant, but rather were metabolically active, sensitive to small differences in environmental quality, and highly subject to physical damage. Gametophyte photosynthetic rates were greater under higher irradiance, and growth rates were greater under longer photoperiods and higher irradiance. Although their survival appeared to be reduced by grazing from large (>1 cm) invertebrates and sedimentation, gametophytes. were able to survive in the field for at least 15 mo and thereby enhance sporophyte recruitment more than a year after settlement. I suggest that Desmarestia gametophytes be regarded as alternate life-history stages that simply maintain populations under a different set of environmental conditions than the macroscopic sporophytes do, rather than as ''dormant" or "resting" stages.

AB This investigation examines how a predator-induced reduction in activity of a prey species (a "nonlethal" predator effect) affects the growth rate of the prey and, indirectly, the growth rate of competitors of the: prey. We further determine how the magnitudes of these effects depend on density of the prey species. We develop a foraging model that predicts a predator will reduce the growth of a focal prey species at low prey density but have little effect at high prey density. The model also predicts that presence of the predator will indirectly facilitate growth of a competitor of the focal species, and that this effect will be negligible at low, and maximal at high, focal species density. Thus it is precisely where the effect of the predator on the growth of the focal species is minimum that the indirect effect on the competitor is maximum.
   We tested these predictions using a system of three species/size classes of anuran larvae and a larval odonate predator (Anax longipes) in cattle watering tanks. By caging the predator we isolated its effect on foraging behavior of the anuran larvae from that of density reduction. We manipulated the density of small green frog larvae (Rana clamitans) while holding density of small bullfrog (R. catesbeiana) and large green frog competitors constant. Small green frogs and bullfrogs reduce their activity in the presence of caged Anax whereas the large green frogs do not.
   Results were in accord with the model predictions. Caged Anax reduced small green frog and bullfrog growth at low small green frog density but had no effect at high small green frog density. In contrast, caged Anax had a positive effect on large green frog growth, but this effect was negligible at low small green frog density and maximal at high small green frog density. The results also showed that the indirect effects of the predator that arose through reduction in prey foraging activity were comparable in magnitude to those expected through reduction in prey density. These results suggest that the nonlethal effects of a predator on prey and, indirectly, on competitors of their prey, can be large in magnitude and depend strongly on relative species densities.

AB The distribution of species depends on the availability of suitable habitats, the capacity to disperse to these habitats, and the capacity of populations to persist after establishment. Dispersal limitation implies that not all suitable habitat patches will be occupied by a species. However, the extent to which dispersal limits local distribution is poorly known. In this study, we transplanted seeds, bulbils, and juvenile plants to examine patterns of dispersal limitation and patch occupancy in seven temperature-forest herbs. Recruitment was recorded during four years in 48 patches. The investigated species varied considerably in their natural abundance in the patches. Patterns of seedling emergence and establishment among patches were not related to any of nine investigated abiotic factors. In contrast, the availability of seeds or bulbils was found to limit recruitment in six of the investigated species. Establishment was also successful in many patches where the species did not occur naturally. Estimated patch occupancy in the investigated species ranged from 17.2% to 94.6%. Seed size was positively correlated with the probability of successful establishment of seeds and negatively correlated with patch occupancy. The results suggest that dispersal limitation is an important structuring factor in temperate-forest herb communities. The distribution of species can be perceived as the result of processes operating both among and within patches. Seed size is a key trait in these processes.

AB Beavers are increasingly viewed as "ecological engineers," having broad effects on physical, chemical, and biological attributes of north-temperate landscapes. We examine the influence of both local successional processes associated with beaver activity and regional geomorphic boundaries on spatial Variation in fish assemblages along the Kabetogama Peninsula in Voyageurs National Park, northern Minnesota, USA. Fish abundance and species richness exhibited considerable variation among drainages along the peninsula. Geological barriers to fish dispersal at outlets of some drainages has reduced fish abundance and species richness. Fish abundance and species richness also varied within drainages among local environments associated with beaver pond succession Fish abundance was higher in upland ponds than in lowland ponds, collapsed ponds, or streams, whereas species richness was highest in collapsed ponds and streams. Cluster analyses based on fish abundance at sites classified according to successional environment indicated that four species (northern redbelly dace, Phoxinus eos; brook stickleback, Culaea inconstans; finescale dace, P. neogaeus; and fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas), were predominant in all successional environments. Several less abundant species were added in collapsed ponds and streams, with smaller size classes bf large lake species (e.g., black crappie, Pomoxis nigromaculatus; smallmouth bass, Micropertus dolomieui; yellow perch, Perca flavescens; and burbot, Lota lota) being a component of these less abundant species. The addition of smaller size classes of large lake species indicates that dispersal of early life-history stages from Kabetogama Lake played a role in determining the species richness and composition of less abundant species in successional environments on the peninsula. Furthermore, collapsed-pond and stream environments closer to Kabetogama Lake had higher species richness than similar successional sites located farther from the lake. Cluster analyses based on fish abundance at sites classified according to drainage indicated that species composition among drainages was influenced both by the presence or absence of geological barriers to fish dispersal and the nonrandom distribution of collapsed ponds and streams. Based on these results, we present a hierarchical conceptual model suggesting how geomorphic boundaries and beaver pond succession interact to influence fish assemblage attributes. The presence of a productive and diverse fish assemblage in headwater streams of north-temperate areas requires the entire spatial and temporal mosaic of successional habitats associated with beaver activity, including those due to the creation and abandonment of beaver ponds. The ultimate impact of the local successional mosaic on fishes, however, will be strongly influenced by the regional geomorphic context in which the mosaic occurs.

AB Interspecific competition has long been implicated as a force structuring the distribution of organisms along environmental gradients. The research presented here uses a survey, foraging observations, and a manipulative field experiment that test the included-niche competition hypothesis as a mechanism structuring the distribution of a generalist grasshopper, Melanoplus femurrubrum, along a food-resource gradient. A field survey of 10 old fields revealed a step-like reduction in M. femurrubrum abundance as the proportion of grass cover in the fields exceeded 60%. Furthermore, M. femurrubrum abundance and the abundance of a potential competitor, the grass specialist Chorthippus curtipennis, were negatively correlated among the fields. Experimental foraging observations showed that M. femurrubrum was a polyphagous feeder that preferred grass and consumed less grass in the presence of C. curtipennis. The pattern of grasshopper distribution and foraging data support an included-niche competition hypothesis. However, in a field experiment that manipulated C. curtipennis presence and absence and the composition of vegetation in which competition might occur, growth and mortality rates in M. femurrubrum did not respond to C. curtipennis competition. Performance was predicted to be lowest in grass-dominated conditions, those corresponding to the locations when M. femurrubrum does not exist. Instead, growth rates were highest and mortality rates were lowest in grass-only treatments. While the survey and foraging observations support the included-niche hypothesis, the experiments suggest that interspecific competition in adult grasshoppers is not the cause of the grasshopper distribution pattern. Similar experiments in western North American prairies indicate that interspecific competition can be important and that foraging ecology can be a good indicator of the interaction. This study contributes to the increasing body of knowledge about interspecific competition's role in organism distributions. It demonstrates that geographic similarity in natural history need not lead to a similar importance of limiting factors.

AB I examined mechanisms and patterns of benefit for the membracid (treehopper) Publilia concava tended by the ant Formica obscuriventris to test two hypotheses: that treehoppers benefit from ant attendance only by protection from predators, and that density-dependent benefit depends on the presence of predators. I used a factorial design, manipulating ants and predators in 1996, and ants and removal of uncollected honeydew in 1997. Results showed that treehoppers benefit from ant attendance by protection from predators. Additionally, results suggested that treehoppers benefit from ant attendance in ways other than protection from predators; tended treehoppers outperform untended treehoppers even with predators excluded. There was no support for the hypothesis that a proximate benefit of ant-tending includes removal of uncollected honeydew. A possible benefit (untested) of ant-tending is increased feeding rates. Treehoppers in small aggregations benefited more than treehoppers in large aggregations, indicating a density-dependent benefit in this mutualism, independent of predator level. Correspondingly, the number of ants per treehopper was highest for small aggregations. This study suggests that individuals can benefit from mutualisms in complex ways. Additionally, it adds to a growing number of studies that support the hypotheses that mutualisms may be stabilized by density-dependent benefit and that density-dependent benefit may be driven by the recruitment patterns of mutualists.

AB The negative impacts of herbivores on plant fitness may include both direct and indirect effects. Direct effects on female plant fitness occur when decreased seed production is due to decreased resource availability from loss of leaf area and its attendant photosynthesis or through consumption of reproductive structures. Indirect effects occur when folivore- and florivore-mediated changes in floral traits influence pollinator preference and/or pollinator efficiency, thus reducing pollen receipt. We examined the effects of both leaf and floral herbivory (bud damage) and determined the relative contribution of direct and indirect effects of damage on female fitness through changes in floral traits for Oenothera macrocarpa (Onagraceae). The experiment was a two-factorial design that manipulated both leaf damage (similar to 25% leaf area removed by hand) and pollen receipt (supplemental hand pollination). We then measured effects of leaf damage on floral traits (corolla diameter, floral tube length, and flower number) and fruit and seed set. Because herbivores damaged corollas in the bud stage in this experiment, we were also able to determine the effect of florivores on subsequent female reproduction.
   Plants in the increased leaf damage treatment (33.4% leaf area loss) produced fewer flowers than natural leaf damage plants (6.5% leaf area loss), and their flowers had smaller corolla diameters and shorter floral tube lengths. Experimentally damaged planes also had 18% lower fruit set and produced 33% fewer seeds compared with natural leaf damage plants. Hand pollination increased fruit set by 60% and total seed number by 38% above that of naturally pollinated plants, demonstrating that female fitness was pollen-limited. Bud damage significantly decreased corolla diameter and floral tube length, and it led to a 68% reduction in fruit set. Hawk moths were observed preferentially visiting flowers with larger corollas, and study flowers with larger corollas had significantly increased probability of setting fruit. Additionally, seed number per fruit was positively related to floral tube length. In path analysis, we found no significant path between percentage leaf damage and female reproduction, suggesting that herbivores did not reduce seed production directly through decreased resource availability. Instead, we found a significant indirect path from percentage leaf damage to seed number through corolla diameter. We conclude that decreased female reproduction was due to changes in floral traits from both leaf and floral bud damage, which affected hawk moth preference (flowers with smaller corollas received fewer visits) and hawk moth efficiency of pollen delivery (flowers with shorter floral tubes had fewer seeds). This study demonstrates that herbivores can mitigate the mutualistic relationship between plants and pollinators through their effects on floral traits.

AB Fluctuating prey populations and their effects on avian predator population dynamics have been studied particularly at high latitudes, where prey populations, especially microtines, are known to be cyclic; raptors show both numerical and functional responses to variations in their prey. In this paper, we investigate the response of a migratory raptor (Montagu's Harrier, Circus pygargus) to variations in abundance of its main prey (common vole, Microtus arvalis) in France. We document multiannual fluctuation in the abundance of common voles. The numerical response of Montagu's Harrier to this variable food supply was studied using breeding parameters (breeding density, breeding phenology, and various measures of breeding success). Breeding density and mean clutch size were strongly correlated with spring vole abundance, whereas mean brood size at fledging was correlated positively with summer vole abundance. The mechanism involved in the numerical response of Montagu's Harrier indicates that dispersal and colonization by yearlings may be more important than natality per se. Pellets collected between 1986 and 1997 were used to determine the functional response of Montagu's Harrier to variations in vole abundance. In terms of biomass. Montagu's Harrier diet consisted mainly of voles (33.7-86.6%, between 1986 and 1997). Vole biomass in pellets was closely related to vole abundance estimated by trapping. A type II functional response was detected, with satiation at high prey density, as the shapes of many relationships between breeding parameters and vole abundance were more curvilinear than linear. Our results fit the pattern of relationships between predators and cyclic prey found in Fennoscandia, in which specialist predators show a strong numerical response, although at such a temperate latitude, a more pronounced functional response might have been expected.

AB We examined the breeding success of forest grouse in relation to anthropogenic forest fragmentation in Finland. Employing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and grouse data derived from Finnish wildlife triangle censuses conducted during 1989-1994, we combined the locations of 2267 Black Grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and 1060 Capercaillie (T. urogallus) females after the breeding season in mid-August with landscape data. The indicators of breeding success were the proportion of grouse hens with a brood and brood size. Two study areas teach 45 000 km(2)) in the boreal zone were selected for investigation.
   The breeding success of grouse was negatively correlated with both fragmentation of forest area per se by farmland and the: decreasing proportion of older forest as a result of clear-cutting. The extent of landscape accounting best for variation in nesting success was an order of magnitude larger (similar to 100 km(2)) than the area most probably used by a grouse female and her brood during the summer, which suggests that landscape scale factors may override local factors such as track size and distance from edge. The proportion of grouse hens with a brood was lower in heavily fragmented landscapes than in more continuous forest landscapes whereas only minor differences in brood size were detected. We suggest that the most likely cause of the observed spatial correlation was higher nest predation by generalist predators in fragmented forest landscapes. The effects of landscape composition on the breeding success of grouse were more marked in northern than in southern Finland, probably because predator populations are more food-regulated in the north. The diminished breeding success of forest grouse as a result of increased forest fragmentation is a probable cause of population declines in forest grouse species during the past decades in Fennoscandia.

AB We conducted laboratory and field experiments to determine the effects of plant quality and prey abundance on the intensity of interactions involving an omnivorous insect, its two herbivorous prey, and their shared host plant. We found that variation in plant quality, prey abundance, and presence of alternative prey altered the functional response of the omnivorous big-eyed bug, Geocoris punctipes (Heteroptera: Geocoridae). The presence of high-quality plant parts (lima bean pods) reduced the number of prey (pea aphids and corn earworm eggs) consumed by big-eyed bugs. The results of our caged, field experiments mirrored those of the functional-response experiment. Populations of pea aphids were larger when caged with big-eyed bugs on bean plants with pods than on plants without pods. Pads, therefore, had an indirect, positive effect on the survivorship of herbivorous insects that feed on lima beans.
   Because pods reduced the number of prey consumed by big-eyed bugs, and caged prey populations were larger on plants with pads, we hypothesized that herbivore populations would be larger in fields of beans with many pods than in fields of beans with few pods. To test this hypothesis, we established 20 x 30 m field plots of lima beans with many pods and with few pods. The results of this experiment forced us to reject our hypothesis: populations of herbivores were much smaller in plots of beans with many pods than in plots of beans with few pods. In an earlier study, we found that pods had a powerful, direct, positive effect on big-eyed bugs. Big-eyed bug populations were larger in plots of beans with many pods in the present study. It appears that the positive direct effects of pods on big-eyed bugs overwhelm the positive indirect effects of pods on herbivore population size, and that pod feeding by big-eyed bugs ultimately results in smaller herbivore populations. Plant quality, therefore, mediates the effect of this omnivore on prey suppression.

AB Multivariate selection models and demographic matrix projections are closely related. The subtle differences among the parameters of both approaches (sensitivities, elasticities, selection differentials, and gradients) can be confusing. I suggest a hierarchical framework for analysis using elasticity path diagrams, "elastograms." The framework combines selection analysis fur the links between phenotypic traits (morphology, behavior) and fitness components (vital rates) with matrix analysis for the relationship between fitness components and population growth rate/fitness.
   Elasticities are often used to quantify the impact of a transition rate in the projection matrix on the population growth rate (lambda). Elasticities fur underlying fitness components such as fecundity and survival rates can be derived from their connection with the transition matrix entries. Yet other traits may affect lambda due to a functional relationship with one or more components of fitness: for instance, the timing of flowering of a plant may affect its seed yield. Elasticities can also be used to quantity the effects of such traits: they can be interpreted as selection gradients for traits expressed on a proportional (mean-standardized) scale. "Evolvabilities" (additive genetic variation in mean-standardized traits), rather than the heritabilities of traits, are needed to predict expected selection responses from the elasticities.
   Elasticities quantify the direct effect of a focal trait on lambda. integrated elasticities measure the impact of a trait through both its direct and indirect effects. This requires knowledge of the correlations among traits. Matrix projections and selection analysis (through multiple regression or path analysis) can be merged into an elasticity path diagram that summarizes the hierarchical relationships among traits and fitness. Such diagrams facilitate the identification of those traits that have the highest impact on the life cycle of the study organism and can be a tool to define the targets of management practices, as well as an aid in comparative life history research.

AB We used two independent methods to determine the dynamics of soil carbon and nitrogen following abandonment of agricultural fields on a Minnesota sand plain. First, we used a chronosequence of 19 fields abandoned from 1927 to 1982 to infer soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics. Second, we directly observed dynamics of carbon and nitrogen over a 12-yr period in 1900 permanent plots in these fields. These observed dynamics were used in a differential equation model to predict soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics. The two methods yielded similar results. Resampling the 1900 plots showed that the rates of accumulation of nitrogen and carbon over 12 yr depended on ambient carbon and nitrogen levels in the soil, with rates of accumulation declining at higher carbon and nitrogen levels. A dynamic model fitted to the observed rates of change predicted logistic dynamics for nitrogen and carbon accumulation. On average, agricultural practices resulted in a 75% loss of soil nitrogen and an 89% loss of soil carbon at the time of abandonment. Recovery to 95% of the preagricultural levels is predicted to require 180 yr for nitrogen and 230 yr for carbon. This model accurately predicted the soil carbon, nitrogen, and carbon : nitrogen ratio patterns observed in the chronosequence of old fields, suggesting that the chronosequence may be indicative of actual changes in soil carbon and nitrogen.
   Our results suggest that the rate of carbon accumulation was controlled by the rate of nitrogen accumulation, which in turn depended on atmospheric nitrogen deposition and symbiotic nitrogen fixation by legumes. Our data support the hypothesis that these abandoned fields initially retain essentially all nitrogen and have a closed nitrogen cycle. Multiple regression suggests that vegetation composition had a significant influence on the rates of accumulation of both nitrogen and carbon; legumes increased these rates, and C-3 grasses and forbs decreased them. C-4 grasses increased the C:N ratio of the soil organic matter and thereby increased the rate of carbon accumulation, but not nitrogen accumulation.

AB Food webs based on flows of organic matter were developed for two small streams to examine food web response to a large reduction in detrital inputs. At the study site, Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in the southern Appalachians, leaf litter inputs and associated microbial assemblages are the main energy source for food webs in headwater streams. We eliminated leaf litter inputs to one stream using a net placed over the first 180 m of stream from its origin. Food webs based on Row of organic matter were developed for a reference stream and the litter-excluded stream for two months. July and December of year 1 of the litter exclusion, to examine effects of leaf litter exclusion on the trophic base of the food web, size distribution of flows, predator-prey interactions, and trophic structure. Flows (mg AFDM.m(-2).d(-1); AFDM = ash-free dry mass) were estimated using gut content analyses for detritus and prey items, coupled with secondary production estimates. We used a whole-stream C-13 tracer method to estimate assimilation of bacteria by invertebrates. The food webs encompassed most (84-91%) of invertebrate secondary production. but <30% of the estimated total links. The primary sources of organic matter for the food web in the reference stream were leaf tissue, bacterial carbon, and animal prey, with <similar to>25-30% of total secondary production derived from each. In-stream primary production led to <1% of invertebrate secondary production. A higher fraction of food web production in the litter-excluded stream was derived from wood. Magnitudes of detrital flows were lower in the litter-excluded stream, and some taxa were missing compared to the reference stream. The fraction of predator ingestion approached 100% of total secondary production for both streams, but this predation was distributed diffusely among several tare. Flows to predators were fewer and smaller in the litter-excluded stream, yet these flows had higher per-biomass consumption coefficients, suggesting stronger interactions among the remaining common taxa. These food webs enabled us to examine interactions among taxa in the streams; hence, we found responses of the stream ecosystem to litter-exclusion that we would not have considered had we only measured changes in invertebrate population sizes or system-level changes in organic matter flow.

AB The size of eggs that evolves within a population will in theory reflect a balance between selection for large eggs and for increased fecundity. Theory also predicts that the intensity of selection for large eggs (via effects of egg size on progeny survival and growth) increases as environmental quality decreases. I took advantage of variation in seed quality among individuals within one population of a single tree species, Cercidium floridum, to (1) quantify variation in the magnitude of selection on seed beetle (Stator limbatus) egg size, and (2) test the hypothesis that the intensity of selection on egg size increases with decreasing host plant quality. The proportion of larvae that failed to penetrate the seed coat varied substantially among individual trees and was used as a measure of seed-coat resistance. The intensities of selection (i) on egg size also varied among trees. This measure i was positively correlated (among trees) with the resistance of seed coats to penetration by larvae of S. limbatus, indicating that that selection is greatest on trees upon which larval survivorship was lowest. This study thus demonstrates that the intensity of selection on egg size increases as larval environmental quality decreases.

AB Annual flooding in low-gradient rivers is recognized as an important subsidy between the river and its broad adjoining floodplains. Unfortunately, relatively few low-gradient rivers are unregulated and retain their natural "flood pulse" behavior in most developed regions of the world. Furthermore, attempts to quantify flood inundation dynamics of any river floodplain are scarce. We used aerial photography to delineate the degree of floodplain inundation and GIS to quantify flooded areas on the forested floodplain of a 6.3-km reach of the Ogeechee River, an unregulated sixth-order river in the southeastern USA. A regression was used to quantify the relationship between discharge and percentage floodplain inundation. Using 58 years of daily discharge data obtained from a U.S. Geological Survey gaging station, we converted daily discharge into daily percentage inundation and produced an inundation-duration curve, which describes the percentage of time that a particular inundation level is exceeded. This showed, for example, that >50% of the floodplain was inundated 15% of the time (54 d/yr) and that 100% was inundated 3.6% of the time (13 d/yr) for the average year. At 50% inundation, system width exceeded channel width by 19 times. In a relatively wet year, we showed that 50-100%, of the floodplain was inundated for several months during the winter-spring. Even in a relatively dry year, >20% of the floodplain (seven times the river width) was inundated for several months. The long term pattern over a period of 58 years (1938-1995) showed considerable fluctuation in inundation and recession occurring throughout most years, with the highest peaks found during winter and spring. The floodplain failed to reach 50% inundation in only four of 58 years. However, in six years, >50% of the floodplain was inundated for at least 30% of the time (i.e., four months of the year). Floods of 50% inundation typically had a duration of at least 30 d. Thus, although inundation may fluctuate considerably within a year, much of the floodplain can be inundated for a relatively long duration. Description of such longterm patterns is essential for understanding natural hydrodynamics of unregulated rivers, particularly as attempts are made to restore previously altered systems. The flood pulse for this forested floodplain river is less predictable and floods are of shorter duration than the large tropical rivers for which the hood pulse concept was originally conceived. Unlike tropical rivers where seasonal patterns of flooding are driven by precipitation, flooding in the Ogeechee River is primarily controlled by seasonal differences in evapotranspiration. Description of inundation dynamics is critical to understanding how plants and animals adapt to a habitat that shifts from dry to lentic to lotic, and in quantifying production of aquatic organisms and ecosystem processes.

AB Soil organic matter in the dry valleys of the McMurdo Sound Region sustains a unique terrestrial microbial community in one of the most extreme climates on earth. The origin of this organic material has long been in question, given the absence of higher plants in this arid ecosystem. We examined the sources and distribution of organic matter from six elevational transects extending along a 30-km section of Taylor Valley (163 degrees E, 77.35 degrees S), from the head of the valley to the Ross Sea. The delta(13)C and delta(15)N of soil were determined both to identify potential sources of soil organic matter (i.e., marine, lacustrine, and/or terrestrial) and to map C and N source distribution in the valley. Results suggest that the primary source for soil organic matter is not the wind transport of organic material from modern aquatic systems (a long-held hypothesis). Instead, our data indicate that modern distributional patterns of low-elevation (<150 m above sea level [a.s.l.]) soil organic matter (SOM) in Taylor Dry Valley are strongly influenced by the climatic history of the region, with the isotopic signatures of SOM along the valley door corresponding to the spatial distribution of ancient glacial tills and lacustrine systems. At many sites, higher elevation soils (>150 m a.s.l.) have isotopic signatures similar to those of autotrophs currently inhabiting nearby cryptoendolithic communities, suggesting that similar autotrophic activity may be occurring in these soils and that longterm primary productivity in dry valley soils contributes to organic matter accumulations. Taken together, these findings support a new "legacy" model for soil organic matter origins and fluxes in the dry valley ecosystem.

AB Optimal Defense (OD) theory predicts that the within-plant allocation of secondary metabolites that function as defenses will be positively correlated with the fitness value of particular plant parts. Here, we experimentally examine this prediction by exploiting our understanding of the mechanisms of wound-induced nicotine production in Nicotiana sylvestris (Solanaceae) to manipulate the patterns of nicotine allocation and to determine their fitness consequences. In two perturbation experiments conducted over three stages of ontogeny (rosette, elongation, and flowering), we wounded or removed leaves of different ages (young, mature, or old) and determined the effects on nicotine allocation (whole-plant and within-plant) and fitness (lifetime viable seed production). OD theory predicts that, as leaves age and their fitness value decreases, the allocation of defense to particular leaves and the fitness consequences of their removal should be positively correlated. We found that (1) leaf removal results in a significant decrease in seed mass at the elongation stage, but not at the rosette or flowering stages; (2) the relative value of leaves decreases from young and mature to old leaves; (3) leaf damage significantly increases the whole-plant nicotine contents of rosette-stage plants, but not of elongation- or flowering-stage plants, and after damage, younger leaves are more heavily defended than older leaves at the elongation and flowering stages; and (4) regardless of ontogenetic stage, plants distribute nicotine among leaves in accordance with their relative fitness value, thus supporting OD theory predictions. Leaf value increases after N fertilization at the flowering stage, but is not changed if adjacent leaves are removed at earlier growth stages. Moreover, plants are capable of sending their root-synthesized nicotine to specific leaves after damage; at the elongation stage, the new and young leaves receive greater proportional allocations of nicotine than other leaves. The cessation of significant whole-plant nicotine inductions at later stages in ontogeny is not due to the root's decreased ability to respond to the plant's wound signal, jasmonic acid (JA) with increased nicotine biosynthesis, but rather to the decline in a leaf's sensitivity to wounding and in its ability to export JA from the leaves to roots.
   Ontogeny has profound effects on the use of this induced defense. Plants mount systemic nicotine inductions at the rosette stage that rely on large increases in de novo nicotine synthesis, switch to the selective targeting of nicotine to the new and young leaves at the elongation stage without large increases in de novo nicotine synthesis, and allocate to reproductive structures, but not leaves, at the flowering stage. These changes are consistent with the predictions of OD theory.

AB A two-year field study was conducted to evaluate the potential of two cactus species, Echinopsis chilensis and Eulychnia acida, to evolve defensive traits against the parasitic mistletoe Tristerix aphyllus (Loranthaceae). The adaptive value of host traits against parasitism was inferred through: (1) identification of the relevant characters of cacti to prevent infection, (2) evaluation of the fitness impact of parasitism on cacti, and (3) estimation of the linear and nonlinear selection coefficients on the relevant characters. Different lines of experimental and correlative evidence indicated that spine length was important in preventing individuals of the two cactus species from becoming parasitized. However, the impact of the mistletoe on cactus fecundity was contingent on the species involved. Even though parasitism decreased fruit production, seed number per fruit, and the total seed output in E. chilensis, low and nonsignificant linear and nonlinear gradients of selection were prevalent in this species, indicating absence of directional and stabilizing/disruptive selection for spine length. Additional analysis based on logistic regression, however, revealed that long-spined E. chilensis had a higher probability of reproduction than did short-spined individuals. Unlike its effect on E, chilensis, the mistletoe had no fitness impact on E. acida, and the maintenance and evolution of spines in this species could not be attributed to parasite-mediated selection. Even though spines act as a first line of defense against parasitism in the two cactus species, selection was detected only on E. chilensis. These results indicate that inferences on the adaptive value of host traits based only upon their role in preventing infection run the risk of overestimating parasite-mediated selection, and thus the potential for host-parasite coevolution.

AB Demographic perturbation analysis explores how population statistics (especially population growth rate lambda) respond to changes in the vital rates (survival, growth, development, reproduction, and so on). Perturbation analysis is used in two logically distinct ways. Prospective analyses (sensitivity and elasticity) explore the functional dependence of lambda on the vital rates. They predict the changes in lambda that would result from any specified change in the vital rates and are independent of previous patterns of variability of the vital rates. Retrospective analyses (life table response experiment [LTRE] methods and other kinds of variance decomposition) express observed variation in lambda as a function of observed (co)variation in the vital rates. Their results are specific to the observed pattern of variation. Sensitivity and elasticity analysis can be used to identify potential management targets because changes in vital rates with high sensitivity or elasticity will produce large changes in lambda. Sometimes that potential may not be realized because it is difficult or impossible to change those vital rates. Retrospective analyses cannot identify potential management targets because they compare the contributions of past changes in vital rates, not the effects of future changes. Just as the results of heritability analysis say nothing about the efficacy of clinical treatments, so the results of retrospective analysis say nothing about the efficacy of potential management tactics. Perturbation analysis is a powerful tool with important implications for conservation. It is important that perturbation analyses be applied properly.

AB We consider methods for estimating the relative contributions of different demographic components, and their associated vital rates, to population growth. We identify components of the population at time i (including a component for animals not in the population at i). For each such component we ask the following question: "What is the probability that an individual randomly selected from the population at time i + 1 was a member of this component at i?" The estimation methods for these probabilities (gamma (i)) are based on capture-recapture studies of marked animal populations and use reverse-time modeling. We consider several different sampling situations and present example analyses for meadow voles. Microtus pennsylvanicus. The relationship between these gamma (i) parameters and elasticities (and other parameters based on projection matrix asymptotics) is noted and discussed. We conclude by suggesting that model-based asymptotics be viewed as demographic theory and that direct estimation approaches be used to test this theory with data from sampled populations with marked animals.

AB The identification of key environmental forcings responsible for population patterns is a pervasive ecological problem and an important application of time series analysis. A common approach, implemented with methods such as cross-correlation and cross-spectral analysis, relies on matching scales of variability. This approach concludes that a population pattern is caused by a physical factor if their variances share a dominant period. In a nonlinear system, however, forcing at one temporal period can produce a response with variability at one or more different periods. Thus, scale-matching methods will be most successful at establishing cause-effect relationships in linear systems, or close to equilibria, where nonlinear systems are well approximated by linear ones. Here, we propose an alternative approach that does not assume linearity and relies on time series models that are both nonlinear and nonparametric. We specifically apply these models to determine the correct but unknown frequency of a periodic forcing. The time series are generated by simulation of a predator-prey model. Under periodic forcing, this type of model is known to be capable of different dynamic regimes, including chaos and quasiperiodicity, in which the power spectra of population numbers exhibit variance at frequencies other than that of the forcing. We show that nonlinear time series models, built with feedforward neural networks, are able to distinguish the correct forcing period in the predator-prey simulations. These results hold under two common limitations of ecological data: the presence of dynamical and measurement noise, and the availability of time series data for only one variable.

AB We studied components of reproductive success in two dioecious fig species, Ficus exasperata and F. hispida. at a deciduous and an evergreen site in south India, over a two-year period. Unlike monoecious figs, which produce a mixture of wasps, seeds, and pollen in every fruit, dioecious Bg species have hermaphrodite (functionally male) trees, which produce wasps and pollen only, and female trees, which produce seeds only. Dioecious fig species are free of the seed-wasp trade-off involved within each monoecious fig fruit; wasp and seed production in dioecious species reflect selective pressures acting on each sex to maximize offspring production. We studied specific predictions of the reproductive behavior of dioecious fig species, predictions that were made based on studies of monoecious figs.
   Pollinator land associated parasitic wasp) arrivals at trees bearing receptive inflorescences were closely linked to the seasonal variation in receptive fig numbers. More wasps arrived at female trees of F. exasperata than at "male" trees, apparently because of synchronized wasp release by male trees during the time of synchronous female tree receptivity. Wasp numbers arriving at male and female trees of F. hispida did not differ significantly, apparently because inflorescence production on male and female trees was more evenly spread over time. Female inflorescences had more pollinators than male inflorescences in F. hispida; female and male inflorescences had approximately equal numbers of pollinators in F. exasperata. Hand-pollination experiments introducing one, three, or eight pollinators into figs of F. hispida showed that foundress number was a significant predictor of resultant wasp or seed number In both Bg species, female inflorescences initiated more flowers than male inflorescences, and produced more seeds than male inflorescences produced wasps. Female fruits were not larger than male fruits at maturity in either fig species. Only in F. exasperata were male fruits significantly smaller in the dry than in the wet site. Both species had a relatively high average level of pollination (>70%). The mean percentage of fruit matured was 56% in F. hispida, and a surprisingly high 78% in F. exasperata.
   Both fig species exhibited strong sex differences in foundress numbers, numbers of Rowers initiated, and numbers of wasps or seeds matured, suggesting strong selection on components of reproductive success within each sex after dioecy evolved. Our quantitative analyses elucidate how some of the many factors in plant-pollinator relationships affect plant reproductive success in the fig-wasp mutualism.

AB A central tenet of density-dependent habitat selection theory, that individual fitness generally declines with increasing population density, has led to the hypothesis that, for colonial species, living at high density produces advantages that outweigh the costs. Seabirds have provided evidence for this hypothesis, and positive effects of high density have been offered as explanations for coloniality in this overwhelmingly colonial group. We investigated effects of nesting density on reproductive success of a colonial seabird that nests at variable densities, the Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus). Using breeding success data collected from 1984 to 1991 as part of a long-term study of this species at a large colony at Punta Tombo, Argentina, and experiments that included manipulation of nesting density, we addressed effects of nesting density at two spatial scales: the within-colony area scale (hundreds to thousands of square meters) and the very small scale of a penguin's immediate surroundings (distance to nearest neighbor).
   Nest density at the colony averaged 8.7 active nests/100 m(2) and ranged from <1 to >50 active nests/100 m(2) (n = 873 plots). In 100-m(2) plots sampled from 1987 to 1990 over large areas of the colony of similar average nest quality and distance inland, the number of fledglings per active nest was inversely correlated with nest density. Experienced breeders using high-quality nests in a high-density study area (>20 nests/100 m(2)) had 0.25 fewer fledglings per active nest than similar birds nesting in a low-density area (<6 nests/100 m(2)). Penguin fights (during which eggs and chicks may be lost), nonbreeding "prospectors" (who can start fights and kill chicks), and nest predation were all significantly more prevalent in the high-density area. Within a low-density area, birds nesting within touching distance of neighbors (<less than or equal to>80 cm) had significantly lower success than those with more distant neighbors. Nests where fighting occurred were significantly closer to their neighbors than were nests where no evidence of fighting was observed. We found no association between predation and distance to nearest neighbor.
   Experimental data were consistent with correlative results. In a plot with reduced density, fledging success was higher (P < 0.10) and fewer agonistic behaviors and predators were observed than in higher density plots. Chicken eggs placed in vacant nests remained untouched by predators longer in low-density areas of the colony than in high-density areas.
   All results indicated that yearly fledging success declines with increasing density at both the local and area scale, and that rates of predation and intraspecific aggression increase with density. The consistently negative effect of increased density begs the question of why Magellanic Penguins are colonial. Possible explanations include benefits to lifetime reproductive success not reflected in yearly hedging success (e.g., mate and nest acquisition or retention) and benefits of aggregation at spatial scales larger than those investigated in this study.

AB We investigate how coexistence between competitors may be influenced by habitat selection when habitats represent either sources or sinks, and given that dispersal is free to evolve. Evolutionary stable dispersal between sourer and sink habitats can occur if local fitnesses vary temporally, either due to intrinsic factors (e.g., chaotic dynamics) or extrinsic factors (e.g., environmental stochasticity). The model assumes locally linear Lotka-Volterra competition between two species. Given sufficiently low density-independent mortality in the sink, dispersal between habitats is an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS). Given a trade-off between competitive ability in the source and mortality in the sink, a sink habitat can promote species coexistence in the source habitat if the inferior competitor species experiences lower mortality in the sink. This highlights how sink habitats may provide mechanisms of coexistence in heterogeneous landscapes. In a second scenario, the competitors have distinct habitat preferences, resulting in the "Ghost of Competition Past" (i.e., complete habitat partitioning) with stable population dynamics. With unstable population dynamics, dispersal between habitats becomes the ESS, and the Ghost vanishes leading either to coexistence of the competitors in both habitats or global exclusion of one species. Our results highlight the importance of jointly considering the effects of spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability when analyzing the coexistence of competing, mobile organisms.

AB Using an experimental approach, this study addresses the following two questions for the perennial herb Paeonia broteroi (Paeoniaceae) at a location in southeastern Spain. (1) What are the relative magnitudes of the effects of pollinators and herbivores (invertebrates and vertebrates feeding on flowers and developing fruits) on maternal fecundity (total seed production per plant)? (2) Are the effects of pollinators and herbivores on fecundity additive, or is there some significant interaction between them? A two-factor ("Pollinators" and "Herbivores," each with two levels, "present" and "excluded") experimental design was used, with individual plants being treated as experimental units and maternal fecundity as the response variable. On average, the effects of pollinators and herbivores were of opposite sign and roughly similar absolute magnitude (similar to 7.5 seeds per plant), thus approximately canceling each other. A significant interaction (non-additivity) between factors did exist, with plants exposed to pollinators experiencing a disproportionately higher incidence of herbivores than those from which pollinators had been excluded. This was mainly due to mammals browsing only on the larger fruits from flowers that had been exposed to pollinators. Only in the absence of herbivores did pollinators account for a significant amount of between-plant variance in maternal fecundity. It is concluded that the interaction between pollinators and herbivores will lead to variable, herbivore-dependent "opportunity for selection" (sensu Arnold and Wade 1984) on P. broteroi by its pollinators. Regional variation in herbivore incidence experienced by P. broteroi populations will presumably generate local variation in the degree of adaptedness of the plant to its pollinators.

AB Current research suggests that the strength of top-down forces in communities increases with resource availability to primary producers. We examined the relative impacts of top-down and bottom-up forces on oak-herbivore communities by factorial manipulation of predation pressure and plant growth and quality. Plant growth and quality (phenolics, nitrogen) and avian predation intensity were altered through the addition of fertilizer to and the exclusion of birds from Quercus prinus and Q. rubra saplings. We censused the densities of insect herbivore guilds and predaceous arthropods on experimental and control trees in the summers of 1996 and 1997. We assessed changes in oak foliage quality using; chemical assays for nitrogen, gallotannins, proanthocyanidins, and foliar astringency (protein-binding capacity). In general, leaf chewers, phloem feeders, and leaf miners were more frequent on fertilized than on unfertilized trees. Predaceous arthropods were also more frequent on fertilized trees and were positively correlated with herbivore densities on Q. prinus saplings. Bird exclusion by itself had no detectable effects on the presence or absence of herbivores or predaceous arthropods. However, avian predation intensity on phloem feeders on Q. rubra did increase in the presence of nutrient addition to the bottom trophic level in July 1997. Cumulative 1997 yearly densities of herbivores and predaceous arthropods showed similar patterns of increasing avian predation pressure on fertilized Q. rubra saplings. Nonetheless, fertilization and bird exclusion treatments did not alter seasonal defoliation levels. At this early stage in the development of our oak-herbivore community, bottom-up forces appear to influence the impact of top-down forces.

AB A fundamental characteristic of any biological invasion is the speed at which the geographic range of the population expands. This invasion speed is determined by both population growth and dispersal. We construct a discrete-time model for biological invasions that couples matrix population models (for population growth) with integrodifference equations (for dispersal). This model captures the important facts that individuals differ both in their vital rates and in their dispersal abilities, and that these differences are often determined by age, size, or developmental stage. For an important class of these equations, we demonstrate how to calculate the population's asymptotic invasion speed. We also derive formulas for the sensitivity and elasticity of the invasion speed to changes in demographic and dispersal parameters. These results are directly comparable to the familiar sensitivity and elasticity of population growth rate. We present illustrative examples, using published data on two plants: teasel (Dipsacus sylvestris) and Calathea ovandensis. Sensitivity and elasticity of invasion speed is highly correlated with the sensitivity and elasticity of population growth rate in both populations. We also find that, when dispersal contains both long- and short-distance components, it is the long-distance component that governs the invasion speed-even when long-distance dispersal is rare.

AB Phenotypic plasticity is a widespread and often adaptive feature of organisms living in heterogeneous environments. The advantages of plasticity seem particularly clear in organisms that show environmentally cued switches between alternative morphs. Information concerning the presence and nature of variation underlying the induction of these morphs, especially under field conditions, would be valuable. Here we examined the basis for variation underlying a predator-induced defense in an intertidal barnacle (Chthamalus anisopoma). In a previous experiment, juvenile barnacles were exposed to a predatory gastropod (Acanthina angelica). Some of these individuals were induced to develop as a predation-resistant form, but other individuals developed as the default, undefended morph. Here we tested two alternative explanations for this observation. One, the "continuous-sensitivity" model, holds that there is normally distributed genetic variation for sensitivity to the cue. This model predicts that, given sufficient exposure to the predator, all individuals would develop as the induced form; it suggests that the previous findings resulted from an insufficient dose of the cue. The second model, the "discontinuous-sensitivity" model, asserts that there is a genetic polymorphism for inducibility such that some individuals are not able to respond to the cue. This model suggests that, with repeated exposures to the predator, the resulting dose-response curve would reach an asymptote at <100%. We conducted a dose-response experiment in order to contrast these two alternatives, and to examine an expectation generated by life-history theory, namely, that repeated exposure to the predator would induce maturity at a younger age. With respect to the life-history prediction, we found no evidence to suggest that repeated exposure of juvenile barnacles to Acanthina affected the age at maturity, even though we found strong evidence for size-selective attack by this predator. With respect to variation underlying induction to the defended morph, we obtained a dose-response curve showing a significant asymptote at about 22% induction, which is inconsistent with the continuous-sensitivity model. Hence the results indicate the possibility of a developmental polymorphism in the barnacle, but no indication of life-history shifts in response to the predator.

AB This study was conducted to determine the influence of animal disturbance, in the form of banner-tailed kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spectabilis) mounds, on soil microbial abundance and activities in a Chihuahuan Desert shrubland. Total organic carbon (TOC), microbial biomass C (C-mic), and basal respiration were quantified in soils from beneath and between creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) in three zones: directly on the mounds, immediately surrounding the mounds, and between mounds. TOC, C-mic, and respiration were enhanced both in soils beneath the canopies of the shrubs and on the mammal mounds. Thus, mammals as well as shrubs contribute to spatial heterogeneity. Ratios of respiration to C-mic (metabolic quotient) were highest on the mammal mounds; however, the ratio of C-mic:TOC was not affected by shrub canopy cover or location relative to mammal mounds. The higher metabolic quotients in the vicinities of the mounds reflect physical disturbance by mammals and suggest higher proportions of relatively easily metabolized organic carbon than in soils more distant from mounds.

AB Mutualistic interactions contain an underlying evolutionary conflict, in that natural selection favors individuals better at exploiting their mutualistic partner, thus potentially destabilizing the mutualism. In the obligate mutualism between yuccas and yucca moths, selective abortion of flowers that receive many moth eggs or receive poor pollen load has been suggested as a mechanism that can prevent evolution of excessive exploitation by moths. Using controlled pollinations, varying pollen amount and source, we asked whether variation in pollination quality of the magnitude seen among moths affects patterns of selective abortion. Pollination experiments in two Yucca filamentosa. populations revealed that both pollen quantity (large/small) and quality (self/one-outcross/two-outcross donors) affected fruit retention, seed set, and seedling growth rate. A pollen load larger than that typically provided by moths increased fruit retention. Outcrossed flowers were selectively retained to fruit, and flowers receiving a mixed outcross load were selectively retained over single-outcross flowers in one population. Seed set per fruit was significantly lower with a small pollen load, and lower when a single outcross source was used than in self or mixed outcross treatments. Outcross seeds germinated at a greater frequency and produced plants that grew faster than those that resulted from self-pollination, yielding a cumulative inbreeding depression of 0.73-0.81.
   Early fruit abortion is a major mortality factor to the yucca moth's progeny, and the female can increase retention by providing high-quality pollinations. Nonetheless, individual pollen loads are usually below levels that provide higher probability of retention, and commonly observed geitonogamous pollinations also appear to conflict with expected strong selection on moths to provide pollinations that give high retention probability. Other factors, such as combined visits by multiple females, floral position effects on retention, and possible costs of moth movement among plants, may interact with the pollination-mediated effects in molding female behavior. These factors do not diminish the potential of selective abortion to promote evolutionary stability of the interaction as they do not provide the moth with a mechanism to circumvent selective abortion.

AB How species interactions vary as a function of habitat characteristics continues to be an important debate in ecology. Using the barnacle-seaweed assemblage common in New England rocky intertidal habitats, I tested the hypothesis that species interactions switch from negative to positive at sites across the Cape Cod faunal barrier because of latitudinal variation in thermal stress and predation intensity between these regions. I manipulated Ascophyllum nodosum canopies in the high zone of two sites from each region and then determined the consequences for underlying Semibalanus balanoides recruits and adults for two years (January 1995 through January 1997). In both years, algal canopies reduced barnacle recruitment and growth rates at all sites but greatly increased survival rates only at the southern sites. When integrated in a demographic framework, these data showed that the reproductive fitness potential of individuals was facilitated by the algal canopy at southern sites but was reduced under similar conditions at northern sites. At southern sites, this was likely the result of buffering from physical stresses in the absence of predators. At northern sites, any buffering from physical stress was likely offset by an increase in mortality in the presence of predators. Interestingly. this variability in species interactions appealed to be associated with subtle variation in climate. Facilitation was evident only during 1995, the warmest year on record since 1900. In contrast, interactions were entirely negative during 1996, a slightly cooler year. These results suggest that species interactions in the intertidal zone may be sensitive to even subtle changes in climate. Interspecific buffering of neighbors from thermal stress is likely to be common in other systems and suggests that both aquatic and terrestrial vegetation may become increasingly important to local species persistence as climates change during the next century.

AB Many ecologists use two-dimensional systematic sampling to estimate mean density of individuals over the domain sampled. They usually calculate the variance of the mean as if the sample were a simple random sample, using the unbiased estimator under this sampling design, that is, sigma(2)/n. This practice leads to a selection bias, i.e., incorrect inclusion probabilities of population units in the sample are used in the estimator of variance of the mean. The magnitude of the bias varies with the underlying spatial autocorrelation structure.
   Design-based inference and model-based inference are two conceptual frameworks for tackling estimation of variance of the mean in a systematic sample. This paper reports use of the geostatistical estimation variance sigma(E)(2) with the model-based approach. This variance of the overall spatial mean depends on the spatial autocorrelation structure of the data. We illustrate the method by considering the density of acorns fallen under a sessile oak during one season. Acorns were numbered in square quadrats of 0.25 m(2); the data set was exhaustive. We drew nine one-start systematic samples from the whole population of quadrats. We computed semivariograms for the whole population and each sample and fitted them to exponential models without nugget. Using geostatistical theoretical results, we calculated a variance of the mean density of acorns by Monte Carlo integration.
   We show that our variance estimate depends on (1) the origin of the systematic sample, the central sample being the most accurate, (2) quadrat size, with a decrease in the variance when quadrat size increases, (3) the semivariogram model, (4) discretization of the domain used in Monte Carlo integration, and (5) the random number generator. Considering all sources of variation, the variance estimate we calculated ranged from similar to 2 to 36 in our example, for an overall mean equal to 95 acorns per quadrat. Geostatistical variance mainly reflects the locations and size of the sampled quadrats, and the spatial autocorrelation function.
   In our example, using the variance estimator of a simple random sample leads to a high selection bias. The bias can be neglected only in the absence of significant spatial autocorrelation in the sample. Otherwise, we advocate a geostatistical model-based approach that accounts for spatial autocorrelation.

AB We introduced tracer levels of N-15-enriched nitrate into the oligohaline reach of the Parker River estuary (Massachusetts, USA) to study the transformation and fate of watershed-derived nitrogen during the biologically productive summer period. Intensive temporal and spatial measurements were made of the isotopic label in a wide range of organisms during the N-15 amendment and for 2 mo thereafter. The tracer helped determine the relative trophic importance of three major sources of organic nitrogen supporting the food web of the upper Parker River estuary: planktonic and benthic primary producers, and detritus derived mostly from the surrounding marsh. The planktonic centric diatom Actinocyclus normanii was the primary vector of tracer nitrogen to benthic and water-column organisms. Fauna that attained the highest N-15-tracer content (planktonic copepods, planktivorous juvenile fishes, several macrofaunal crustaceans) derived a major part of their incorporated nitrogen (similar to 50% or more) from the bloom-forming planktonic diatom through consumption of freshly produced cells and deposited diatom detritus, or through processing of diatoms by. an herbivorous intermediary. Of the nitrogen incorporated by intertidal sedimentary biota (pennate diatoms, harpacticoid copepods, oligochaetes), benthivorous fishes (mummichog, white sucker), and sand shrimp, 10-30% derived from planktonic diatoms, often through a delayed remineralization and re-incorporation loop. Fauna that assimilated little label (spionid polychaete, anthurid isopod, American eel) obtained >90% of their nitrogen from a pathway based on plant detritus, or from older, nonlabeled diatom detritus. Assimilation and remineralization by benthic organisms of nitrogen incorporated in A. normanii demonstrated an unexpectedly strong linkage of water-column and benthic production. Benthic organisms continued to show tracer enrichment up to 2 mo after the end of tracer addition, indicating that deposited planktonic diatoms constituted a benthic food and nitrogen reserve. The N-15-tracer illuminated food web pathways and revealed the speed with which nitrogen moves through this estuarine ecosystem.

AB Insect pollinators of the Mediterranean shrub Lavandula latifolia (Labiatae) differ in components of pollinating effectiveness that may influence seed production and progeny quality. This study tests the prediction that L. latifolia flowers exposed to pollination regimes differing in pollinator composition should differ in their expected contribution to population recruitment in the field, as measured in terms of established seedlings, because of differences in seed production, progeny quality, or both. Using a randomized complete block design, two pollination regimes were induced during a 3-wk period on each of 15 L. latifolia plants by alternately exposing flowers in the two halves of each shrub to natural pollinators during two nonoverlapping diurnal periods (0930-1630, MD regime; dawn to 0930 and 1630 to dusk, R regime). The two pollination regimes differed in pollinator composition. The importance as flower visitors of butterflies and small bees was greater during the MD regime, which was also characterized by higher flower visitation rate and higher probability of visitation per time unit of individual flowers. MD flowers set proportionally more fruits, and each fruit contained more seeds, than R flowers. Seed production per inflorescence was also greater in MD than in R half-plants. Seeds from the MD and R regimes did not differ significantly in either mean mass, probability of germination under laboratory conditions, or probability of producing a seedling when planted in a greenhouse. When planted in the field, seeds originating from MD flowers had a greater probability of producing a seedling than those originating from R flowers, the difference being greatest where soil characteristics were most adverse for early seedling growth. In the field, MD and R seedlings did not differ in post-emergence survival rate and size of eventual survivors. The estimated average probability (+/-1 SE) of one ovule eventually producing one third-year, established seedling in the home environment was significantly greater for MD (0.0192 +/- 0.0041) than for R (0.0085 +/- 0.0020) flowers. This demographic advantage of MD ovules was mainly accounted for by the greater seedling emergence rate of MD seeds, and only secondarily by the greater fruit- and seed-set of MD flowers. Observed patterns may be explained by a combination of increased outcrossing derived from the greater relative importance of small bees and butterflies as pollinators, and increased gametophytic competition resulting from increased overall visitation rates to individual flowers during the MD pollination regime. This study suggests that even relatively minor differences in pollinator composition and abundance may have a measurable demographic impact on plant populations.

AB In a biotic environment, current reproduction will affect future population sizes, but these future changes may also affect the optimality of current reproductive decisions. We investigate the dynamics of predator-prey cycles if both predators and prey respond to each other's (and their own) population density by adjusting their breeding effort. We find that adaptive breeding strategies of predators can produce equally profound changes to the dynamics as those produced by analogous strategies of their prey. Contrary to earlier, more limited models, we find that breeding suppression can be either destabilizing (i.e., generating cycles or chaotic behavior) or stabilizing, in cases where predators, prey, or both can adopt adjustable strategies. The direction of change depends on the shape of the density dependence in the growth rates, as well as how it is affected by the breeding decisions. We discuss these findings in light of the Fennoscandian vole cycle, where antipredatory behavior of voles has been evoked to explain some properties of the cycle, and where many predators show pronounced variability in their breeding effort according to the phase of the cycle.

AB We analyze a 114-year historical record (1871-1985) of the change in abundance of 373 native plant species in Auckland, New Zealand, with the aim of identifying the attributes that predisposed some species to local extinction and rarity following European settlement. The 1871 survey records the relative abundance of native plants in the Auckland area just 31 years after Europeans began clearing the native vegetation for settlement, whereas the 1985 survey records the relative abundance of the same species 114 years later, when the area had been transformed into an urban landscape. Four attributes were significantly and independently related to the probability that a species was locally extinct or rare in 1985. (1) compared with species that were common in 1871, initially rare species were more likely to be extinct or rare in 1985; (2) compared with tall species, short species were more likely to be extinct or rare in 1985; (3) gymnosperms and dicotyledons were more likely to be extinct or rare in 1985 than were pteridophytes or monocotyledons; and (4) species occupying habitats that suffered the greatest loss of area following European settlement were more likely to be extinct or rare in 1985 relative to species occupying less affected habitats. Two additional attributes, long-distance dispersal ability and capacity for clonal spread, failed to independently explain significant variation in 1985 abundance. We discuss the likely causes of these relationships and consider their implications for understanding extinction processes.

AB If habitat selection is adaptive, habitat choice by individuals should be directly associated with reproductive success. With that expectation in mind, we examined consequences of habitat choice in Sage Sparrows (Amphispiza belli) in southern California. Habitat selection in Sage Sparrows was pronounced, with vegetation measurements within territories differing significantly from those of interspersed unoccupied areas. Likewise, sites where sparrows placed their nests were significantly different from random sites within territories. Both successful territories (those containing a nest that fledged at least one young) and successful nest sites differed significantly in habitat from those that were unsuccessful. However, there was an inverse relationship between choice and its consequences: the mean score of unsuccessful territories on a discriminant function describing the habitat gradient from unoccupied to occupied areas (i.e., choice) was significantly higher than the mean for successful ones. In other words, birds preferred to settle in areas in which they did worse. Thus, attractiveness of habitat has become inversely related to its suitability, and the study site now serves as an "ecological trap." Because predation accounted fur 80-90% of nest loss, we speculate that decoupling of habitat attractiveness from suitability has been produced by redistribution of predators (mainly snakes) due to anthropogenic landscape-level changes in the region.

AB Distribution of mobile animals may reflect decisions on how to balance conflicting demands associated with foraging and avoiding predators. A simple optimality model predicts that mobile animals should respond to changes in mortality risk (mu) and growth rate (g) by shifting habitats in a way that maximizes net benefits. In this study, field caging and tethering experiments quantified habitat-specific growth rates and mortality risk, respectively, for three different sizes of a coral reef fish, Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus), during its juvenile tenure in off-reef nursery habitats. These sizes bracketed the size at which this species undergoes an ontogenetic habitat shift from the interstices of macroalgal clumps ("algal habitat") to areas outside, or adjacent to, macroalgae and other physically complex microhabitats ("postalgal habitats"). Experimental results were used in a cost-benefit analysis to test the following alternative (but not mutually exclusive) a hypotheses: (1) juvenile grouper shift habitats in a way that maximizes growth rates (g); (2) juveniles shift habitats in a way that minimizes mortality (predation) risk (mu); and (3) if trade-offs exist between maximizing growth rate and minimizing mortality risk, juveniles shift habitats in a way that minimizes the ratio of mortality risk to growth rate (mu/g).
   Results suggested that small fish face a trade-off between living in the relatively safe algal habitat and achieving high growth rates in postalgal habitats. The value of mu/g was significantly lower in the algal than postalgal habitats for small fish, which typically reside in the algal habitat, and significantly lower in postalgal habitats for medium and large fish, which typically reside in postalgal habitats. Thus, habitat use by juvenile Nassau grouper was consistent with the "minimize mu/g hypothesis." These results highlight how behavioral responses to ecological processes, such as changing predation risk with body size, determine distribution patterns of mobile animals.

Total recovery of added N-15 (29.5 mg N-15/m(2) as NaNO3) in inorganic N, microbial immobilization in forest floor and soil microbial biomass, soil organic matter, and root biomass pools (0-10 cm depth) was 93% two hours following application of the (NO3-)-N-15 but rapidly dropped to similar to 29% within one month, presumably due to movement of the isotope into other plant tissues or deeper into soil. Microbial immobilization was initially (i.e., at 2 h) the largest sink for (NO3-)-N-15 (21% in forest floor; 16% in soil microbial biomass). After one month, total N-15 recovery varied little (24-18%) throughout the remainder of the growing season, suggesting that the major N transfers among pools occurred relatively rapidly. At the end of the four-month experiment, the main fates of the N-15 label were in soil organic matter (7%), root biomass (6%), and N immobilized in forest floor and soil microbial biomass (6%).
   Temporal changes in the N-15 enrichment (atom % excess N-15) Of plant and soil pools during the first month of the experiment indicated the dynamic nature of NO3 cycling in this Forest. The N-15 enrichment of soil microbial biomass and the forest floor significantly increased two hours after isotope additions, suggesting rapid microbial immobilization of NO3-. In contrast, the N-15 enrichment of soil organic matter did not peak until day 1, presumably because much of the added N-15 cycled through microorganisms before becoming stabilized in soil organic matter, or it directly entered soil organic matter via physical processes. Furthermore, the N-15 enrichment of root biomass (<0.5-mm diameter and 0.5-2.0 mm diameter) was greatest between day 7 and day 28, following significant increases in the N-15 enrichment of soil organic matter (day 1) and, more importantly, NH4+ (day 2). From these data we conclude that microorganisms are immediate. short-term sinks for anthropogenic NO3-. Although the long-term fate of NO3- additions to this forest is likely in soil organic matter and plants, the cycling of N through microorganisms appears to be the major short-term factor influencing patterns of NO3- retention in this ecosystem.

AB Turtles provide excellent models for studies of life history strategies, but terrestrial species are underrepresented in these analyses. We present a life table and demographic parameters of an inland population of Gopherus berlandieri to contribute to the study of evolution of turtle life histories. Data were gathered during a mark-recapture and radiotelemetry study in the Tamaulipan Biotic Province in southern Texas, USA. A total of 835 individuals were captured, measured, and their ages estimated. Females matured at 131 mm carapace length at an average of 5 yr of age (range: 4-8 yr). Clutch size, as determined by ultrasound, averaged 2.07 +/- 0.15 eggs (n = 49). No nests were found, and we estimated clutch frequency with a quadratic model to be 1.34 clutches female(-1).year(-1). Survival was estimated from age frequency regression and telemetry. Annual male survival (0.828, 0.834) differed (P < 0.05) from female survival (0.728, 0.774) for both techniques of estimation. Age-specific female survival ranged from 0.62 to 0.83 for 5- to 15-yr-old tortoises. Differential mortality of sexes led to a male-biased sex ratio in older age classes. Age structures of captured individuals did not vary (P > 0.05) among years, and population estimates did not differ among years; therefore, we constructed a life table under the assumption of a stationary population (r = 0.0). Under this assumption, survival from nest to age 4 yr must be at least 0.245, with hatchling survival of 0.528 to maintain a stationary population. Gopherus berlandieri matured at an earlier age, had smaller clutch sizes, and exhibited lower rates of female survival than other Gopherus species. We propose a physiological mechanism for lower female survival that implies trade-offs among egg size, subsequent hatchling survival, and female health. We maintain that high hatchling survival is necessary for population persistence. In an evolutionary context, we theorize that the selective advantages of small size and the life history strategies of G. berlandieri have been and are critical to its persistence.

AB Plants growing at high elevations in tropical mountains show a scleromorphic habit at the leaf and plant level, despite the fact that alpine landscapes are generally considered to be cool and humid environments. This paper tests the hypotheses (1) that aridity (potential transpiration E-P/rainfall P) in tropical alpine environments can be high despite low temperatures, and (2) that aridity in tropical alpine environments may be correlated with scleromorphic habit. A leaf energy balance model was developed that calculates the change in E-P for a standard leaf along elevational transects in equatorial and middle-latitude mountains by accounting for pressure (elevation) and temperature effects on transpiration. Modeled leaf-level transpiration in tropical alpine environments can be substantial and may even exceed transpiration at low elevations in middle latitudes. At 5000 m elevation, a high diffusion coefficient for water vapor under low air pressure and a high radiation load result in E-P rates 50-90% higher in tropical mountains than in middle-latitude ones. High E-P rates at high elevations are expected (1) in mountains of the dry tropics with low cloudiness and low rainfall but high radiation and, (2) in small oceanic mountain ranges with a strong advection of moist air and, thus, a reduced temperature lapse rate on the slope.
   Data from tropical Mount Haleakala (Maui, Hawaii) and from the middle-latitude Tyrolian Alps (Austria) were used to test the predicted E-P rates. The two mountains sharply contrast with respect to vertical distribution of E-P and rainfall. At high elevation on Maul, the calculated E-P was high (and was consistent with measured atmometer evaporation rates E-m), whereas rainfall was moderate to low. At high elevation in the Alps, both E-P and E-m were low compared to similar elevations on Maul, but rainfall was high. Worldwide mountain climate data sets show that rainfall tends to decrease upslope in many tropical mountains, while it increases with elevation in most middle-latitude mountains. I conclude that (1) high-elevation environments in tropical mountains are more arid than similar elevations in middle-latitude mountains as a result of both higher evaporative demand and lower rainfall, and (2) that aridity can significantly contribute to the scleromorphy of tropical alpine plants which had previously been attributed to low temperature or high radiation effects alone.

AB Matrix population models require the population to be divided into discrete stage classes. In many cases, especially when classes are defined by a continuous variable, such as length or mass, there are no natural breakpoints, and the division is artificial. We introduce the "integral projection model," which eliminates the need for division into discrete classes, without requiring any additional biological assumptions. Like a traditional matrix model, the integral projection model provides estimates of the asymptotic growth rare, stable size distribution, reproductive values, and sensitivities of the growth rate to changes in vital rates. However, where the matrix model represents the size distributions, reproductive value, and sensitivities as step functions (constant within a stage class), the integral projection model yields smooth curves fur each of these as a function of individual size. We describe a method for fitting the model to data, and we apply this method to data on an endangered plant species, northern monkshood (Aconitum noveboracense). With individuals classified by stem diameter. The matrix and integral models yield similar estimates of the asymptotic growth rate, bur the reproductive values and sensitivities in the matrix model are sensitive to the choice of stage classes. The integral projection model avoids this problem and yields size-specific sensitivities that are not affected by stags duration. These general properties of the integral projection model will make it advantageous for other populations where there is no natural division of individuals into stage classes.

AB The availability of resources may limit consumer populations, and temporal variation in resources may facilitate the coexistence of competitors. Accurate estimates of resource availability often cannot be obtained by counting potential food items, because of difficulties in determining resource quality. Instead, resource supplementation experiments must be conducted, but few experimental studies have examined the temporal patterns of resource limitation. To determine the occurrence, intensity, and temporal variation of resource limitation in natural populations of planktonic rotifers, experiments were conducted using two species of herbivorous rotifers from a eutrophic pond, Keratella cochlearis and Synchaeta sp. The difference in population growth rates in food-supplemented treatments relative to controls (Delta r) was used as a measure of the intensity of food limitation. Rotifers were usually food limited, with Keratella and Synchaeta showing significant food limitation (Delta r > 0) in 63% and 87% of the experiments, respectively. There was temporal variability in Delta r on time scales of one to a few weeks, indicating rapid changes in resource availability. Synchaeta population dynamics were more closely controlled by resources than was the case for Keratella, and the intensity of food limitation was higher for Synchaeta than for Keratella, possibly due to the more specialized feeding habits of Synchaeta.

AB Multiple antipredator defense strategies and their interactions were examined in a field study of the predatory planktonic waterflea Bythotrephes longimanus in Lake Constance, at the northern fringe of the European Alps. Because of its large body size and conspicuousness, Bythotrephes is a preferred prey of freshwater fish. We observed seasonal changes in life history and morphology and diel vertical migration, all best understood as a response to fish predation. Bythotrephes population dynamics were characterized by pronounced population growth in late spring, maximum abundances in June, and a steady decline toward the end of the season. In late spring, high population growth rates were achieved by means of large clutches, low investment in individual offspring, and small size at first reproduction. While the population was still increasing, a marked life history shift occurred. The reproductive strategy of females switched toward high per-offspring allocation at the expense of clutch size. This change in reproductive behavior resulted in an increase in the size of neonates and was accompanied by an increase in the size at first reproduction. Such a life history shift is typically observed in the presence of gape-limited predators, which points to the importance of juvenile fish as the principal vertebrate planktivores in Lake Constance. The length of Bythotrephes defensive spina increased throughout the season, reflecting increasing predation pressure, probably owing to seasonally increasing mouth gape size of juvenile fish. In contrast to the predictions of the predator-avoidance theory, the migration amplitude of large and conspicuous Bythotrephes was small as compared to other zooplankton species. We argue that theory and data can be reconciled ii: the migration behavior of Bythotrephes is considered as a result of an interaction of predator defenses in the presence of predominantly juvenile, gape-limited fish. As Bythotrephes achieved protection because of its life history and spina, the costs of large diel migrations may outweigh the benefits.

AB Spatial variation in abundance of reef fishes with dispersing larvae often has been attributed to variation in the supply of new colonists from the plankton, which we term "supply determination." We conducted field experiments with three species of planktivorous damselfishes (Dascyllus flavicaudus, D. trimaculatus, and Amphiprion chrysopterus) to distinguish between the influence of supply determination and spatial variation in suitable microhabitat ("habitat determination") on patterns of abundance, and to evaluate whether habitat became limited. In experiments where the abundance of initially unoccupied habitat suitable for these fishes was manipulated among a series of plots, colonization and population trajectories were followed for up to six years. Additional experiments explored the effect that the densities reached on colonization plots had on settlement.
   Colonization experiments revealed positive linear relationships between the time-averaged abundance of adults and of new colonists among experimental plots. While consistent with supply determination, the patterns resulted almost exclusively from experimentally imposed variation in the amount of suitable habitat among plots. For both species of Dascyllus, habitat became limited as densities reached on experimental habitats suppressed settlement by similar to 80-90%. Spatial variation in the abundance of Amphipiron also mirrored availability of suitable habitat, although for this species we found no compelling evidence that local densities were constrained by anything other than an undersupply of larvae. These results highlight the need to consider explicitly patterns of covariation in larval supply and availability of suitable resources, to examine density effects on input as well as loss rates. and to quantify the relative effects of recruitment limitation and resource limitation on local densities.

AB In many ectotherms, incubation temperature has profound effects on the timing of hatching and size of hatchlings, but the mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood. We studied the energetics of embryonic development and growth in the lizard Sceloporus undulatus. Eggs were incubated at six constant temperatures, ranging from 28 degrees to 38 degreesC, and embryonic metabolism, incubation period,and body size at hatching were determined. The duration of embryonic development decreased significantly from 55 d at 28 degrees to 40 d at 32 degreesC but did not differ significantly between 32 degrees and 34 degreesC. Embryos incubated at temperatures above 34 degreesC did not survive to hatching. Metabolic rate at specific stages of development (percentage of total incubation period) did not differ among embryos incubated at 28 degrees, 30 degrees, and 34 degreesC. As a result, the total amount of energy expended during the incubation period at 28 degreesC (2.0 kJ) was greater than that at 30 degrees -34 degreesC (1.7-1.8 kJ). However, the difference in energy expenditure did not affect body size at hatching; neither snout-vent length nor body mass varied significantly with incubation temperature, and both were the same as those of hatchlings collected in the field. Thus, there was no apparent , trade-off between hatching date and body size of lizards at hatching.
   In a natural population in New Jersey, USA, we quantified soil temperatures at potential nesting sites and studied the thermoregulatory, behavior of gravid females to examine the possible consequences of female behaviour for hatching phenotypes. In females and at potential nest sites, embryos would experience temperatures that resulted in high mortality in the laboratory experiment (>32 degreesC). Gravid females had a field body temperature of 33.9 degreesC (95% CI = 0.8 degreesC) and selected a body temperature of 33.3 degreesC (95% CI = 1.9 degreesC) when placed in thermal gradients in the laboratory. Soil temperatures rose above 32 degreesC for several hours each day. Embryos must be able to survive intermittent exposure to temperatures that were lethal under conditions of chronic exposure in the laboratory. Selection of relatively high body temperatures by gravid females, coupled with tolerance of acute exposure to relatively high soil temperatures, would reduce the incubation period without a concomitant reduction in body size at hatching.

AB Larger species tend to occupy more habitats, but a theoretical framework for the pattern is lacking. I modified the continuous-time logistic equation of population growth in two ways to allow for such a habitat-based theoretical framework. First, I separated birth rate from death rate. Second, I included two new terms in the equation: (1)an explicit spatial variable for habitat quality that reflects the match between a habitat and a population (species-habitat match), and (2) a demand/supply function that depends on the ratio between the energy used by all populations occurring in a habitat, and energy available in that habitat. Energy was used as a common currency to overcome differences between species of different body sizes as well as to overcome differences caused by disproportional intra- and interspecific effects. Allometric relations were used to characterize parameter values that correlate with body size, such as metabolic rate, birth rate, and death rate. The analytical solution of the: equation for carrying capacity shows that, for a population to have a positive carrying capacity, its ratio of death rate to birth rate should be less than its match to the habitat it occupies. Literature-based body-size-dependent birth and death rates of Eutherian mammals show that the death-rate:birth-rate ratio decreases with body size. Combining the analytical solution and the death-rate:birth-rate ratio reveals that habitat generality should positively scale with body size. I used this model to simulate simple spatially explicit landscapes having diverse habitats and combinations of species of various body sizes. Using realistic parameters, the model generates results that are consistent with field observations. Thus, one can focus on specific processes to explore macroecological questions.

AB We studied host plant abundance, host use, and oviposition preference in metapopulations of the butterfly Melitaea cinxia within an area of 3500 km(2) in the Aland islands, southwestern Finland. In the study area, M, cinxia has similar to 400 small local populations on dry meadows with the larval host plants, Plantago lanceolata and Veronica spicata. Plantago lanceolata occurs in practically all meadows otherwise suitable for the butterfly, whereas the distribution of V. spicata is largely restricted to the northwestern part of the study area. Based on observations of 6500 prediapause larval groups during 1993-1996, we document spatial variation in host plant use in relation to their abundance (electivity). The fraction of larval groups found on V, spicata increased disproportionally with the relative cover of V. spicata in the habitat patches. Additionally, the probability of Veronica use in a population increased with increasing number of larval groups found on Veronica in the surrounding populations but decreased with increasing use of Plantago in the neighborhood. This regional effect on host use at the scale of migrating butterflies could be caused either by spatial variation in the insect (in either preference or performance) or by spatial variation in plants tin resistance to attack by the butterflies). To study the first possibility, we conducted oviposition preference experiments using butterflies from five metapopulations located 2-55 km from each other and characterized by differences in host plant availability and host use. We found clear genetic differences in oviposition preference between the five metapopulations consistent with the observed host use patterns in the field. We conclude that the spatial host use patterns of M. cinxia in the study area are driven both by direct effects of local host abundance and by indirect effects mediated through metapopulation-level adaptation to the regionally more abundant host plant.

AB Most natural food webs have more than one predator species, and many have trophic interactions among these predators. When a top predator feeds on an intermediate predator and they both feed on a shared basal resource, a phenomenon labeled intraguild predation (IGP), the potential exists for complex food web dynamics due to predation and competitive effects. Here we investigate the relative importance of direct predation vs. competition by a top predator on an intermediate predator.
   The study system is the rocky intertidal interaction web formed by the predatory seastar Pisaster ochraceus, the predatory whelks Nucella emarginata and N. canaliculata, and a shared resource species, the mussel Mytilus trossulus. Previous experiments documented strong negative effects of Pisaster on mussels and whelks, but the mechanisms responsible for the effects on whelks, whether competition or predation, were not identified. Here we report results of a field experiment that manipulated both Mytilus and Pisaster to determine the short- and longer-term changes in whelk populations. Using a simplified dynamic model for changes in abundance over the initial stages of the experiment, we separated and quantified the top-down effect of direct predation by seastars vs. the bottom-up effects of competition and food limitation. Short-term results were in agreement with longer-term responses. Results suggest that direct and indirect bottom-up influences of mussels were far stronger than predation, and thus, whelk increases in the absence of seastars were due to reduced competition with Pisaster. Large differences between the body sizes of seastars and whelks make it difficult to determine the ultimate nature of the resource under competition between predators. Small mussels may constitute only a food resource for seastars, but to some extent, they also represent a microhabitat for whelks. Differences in the magnitude of the response to mussel manipulations between Nucella species might be due to slight differences in the way the species utilize mussel beds. Some of the predictions of theoretical IGP models regarding coexistence and stability of species may not apply to this interaction web because it includes species with both "open" and "closed" populations, rather than just closed populations as assumed by the models.

AB It has been suggested that the spatial distribution of many marine pelagic organisms can be described by a hierarchical patch structure. Here, we present evidence for a hierarchical spatial distribution of murres (Uria spp.) foraging on capelin (Mallotus villosus) in the Barents Sea. We found three distinct levels of patchiness. At the largest level we found spatial structures with a characteristic scale of >300 km, and a spatial overlap between murre and capelin. Within the large-scale structures, we found medium-scale patches with a characteristic scale of similar to 50 km, and an overlap between the patches of murre and capelin. Within the medium-scale patches we found small-scale patches with a characteristic scale of similar to 3 km. At the smallest scale there was no overlap between patches of capelin and murre. Our results indicate that murres actively track the spatial distribution of capelin at several scales. We suggest that murres use a strategy where the search pattern reflects the hierarchical properties of the prey system. Under this hypothesis the predator searches for large-scale patches by using long travel distances and low turning frequency. Once within a large-scale patch, the predator starts searching for smaller scale patches by using shorter travel distances and higher turning frequencies. Such a search pattern will minimize the area to be searched by the predator and move the predator upward in the hierarchical prey system in a stepwise fashion.

AB Recent theoretical studies have shown the potential for chaotic dynamics in simple three-species food chains. Most of these studies have focused on linear food chains, although natural food chains are seldom isolated from the surrounding food web. There is a growing awareness that food web dynamics can be strongly influenced by the behavior and movement of predators, energy, and nutrients across ecosystem and subecosystem boundaries. Motivated by observations from lakes, where the pelagic food web is often linked to the littoral food web by mobile predators, we constructed a simple model to evaluate the dynamics of two food chains linked by a top predator with prey preference. Linking the two food chains had no qualitative effect on model dynamics, although it did increase the density of the top predator. Instead, the prey preference of the top predator changed the system dynamics. We found a range of prey preferences that could eliminate chaos, dampen oscillations, and even produce point stability in a previously oscillatory system. The strength of prey preference required to produce a point attractor in a previously chaotic system was positively related to the dimension of chaos (a measure of the complexity of chaos). Our results suggest that, although chaos is possible in food webs, common processes like prey preference reduce the potential for chaos.

AB The relationship between homopterans and ants is generally thought to be mutualistic, as both partners seem to benefit from an association. In aphids, previous studies have shown that ant tending improves the survival and reproduction of aphid colonies, mainly by protection of aphids from enemy attack. However, the effects of ant tending on the fitness of individual aphids have rarely been addressed. We investigated the effects of ant tending on life history traits of aphids feeding singly on a host plant, in the absence of natural enemies. A factorial design allowed us to control for variation in the level of tending effort among individual ant colonies. The presence of workers of the ant Lasius niger had a strong positive effect on the fitness of individuals of the aphid Metopeurum fuscoviride. Ant-tended individuals lived longer, matured earlier, had a higher rate of reproduction, and a higher expected number of offspring than aphids not tended by ants. An aphid's longevity was significantly correlated with the daily mean number of workers tending it. The strong dependence of aphid fitness on the level of ant tending shows that ants can influence aphid life history traits even when aphids occur singly on plants.

AB Like many animals, barnacles have a complex life cycle with shifts in both diet and habitat. The life cycle of most barnacles has three distinct phases: (1) a planktotrophic nauplius, (2) a non-feeding, planktonic cyprid that subsists on energy reserves, and (3) a benthic juvenile and adult. We conducted a series of experiments to measure the effects of variable food concentration during the naupliar phase on the age, size, and lipid reserves of Balanus glandula cyprids. When food shifted during only the first similar to 25% of the naupliar phase (the first three instars), the initial food level did not affect the timing of metamorphosis to the cyprid. Shifts in food that were restricted to the final similar to 40% of the naupliar phase (the sixth instar) also did not affect age at metamorphosis. During the intermediate portion of the naupliar phase, enhanced food decreased the age at metamorphosis, while reduced food lengthened the naupliar phase. Cyprid size generally correlated positively with changes in food, but a maximal size appeared to result when food increased during the intermediate portion of the naupliar phase (when the timing of metamorphosis was plastic). Amphibian models adequately describe the effects of variable food on the size and age at metamorphosis to the cyprid, provided that the model specifies an upper limit to size at metamorphosis when food is enhanced prior to fixation of development rate. In contrast to effects on size and age at metamorphosis, cyprids' lipid concentration (lipid per unit body size) only responded to shifts in food that occurred during the sixth instar. This resulted because shifts in food during the sixth instar affected both cyprids' size and lipid content (lipid per cyprid). Earlier shifts in food greatly affected a cyprid's size, but had little effect on lipid content or lipid concentration. Because the size, age, and lipid reserves of cyprids all have fitness implications, the net effects of food variability are complicated and depend on exactly when the variability occurs. Short-term changes in food encountered after the third instar and before the sixth will alter the length of the naupliar period and the size of cyprids. Variability restricted to the sixth instar will not alter the age at metamorphosis, but will affect the cyprid's size, lipid content, and lipid concentration.

AB The analysis of presence-absence matrices with "null model" randomization tests has been a major source of controversy in community ecology for over two decades. In this paper, I systematically compare the performance of nine null model algorithms and four co-occurrence indices with respect to Type I and Type II errors. The nine algorithms differ in whether rows and columns are treated as fixed sums, equiprobable, or proportional. The three models that maintain fixed row sums are invulnerable to Type I errors (false positives). One of these three is a modified version of the original algorithm of E. F. Conner and D. Simberloff. Of the four co-occurrence indices, the number of checkerboard combinations and the number of species combinations may be prone to Type II errors (false negatives), and may not reveal significant patterns in noisy data sets. L. Stone and A. Robert's checkerboard score has good power for detecting species pairs that do nut co-occur together frequently, whereas D. Schluter's V ratio reveals nonrandom patterns in the row and column totals of the matrix. Degenerate matrices (matrices with empty rows or columns) do not. greatly alter the outcome of null model analyses. The choice of an appropriate null model and index may depend on whether the data represent classic "island lists" of species in an archipelago or standardized "sample lists" of species collected with equal sampling effort. Systematic examination of a set of related null models can pinpoint how violation of the assumptions of the model contributes to nonrandom patterns.

AB In contrast to documented increases in woody plant dominance of former savannas and grasslands of North America, ecotones between oak (Quercus L.) woodlands and semi-desert grasslands of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico have been relatively stable over the past several centuries. Soil resource partitioning, wherein shallow-rooted grasses use summer precipitation and deep-rooted woody plants use winter precipitation, may have contributed to the stable coexistence of grasses and trees that form savannas at this ecotone. Thus, predicted changes in regional precipitation patterns and soil moisture caused by anthropogenic trace gas emissions have the potential to alter interactions between woody plants and grasses with potential ramifications fur their relative abundance and distribution.
   We used a field experiment to investigate the response of the dominant woodland and savanna tree Quercus emoryi to simulated potential scenarios of precipitation redistribution within the context of shifts in the woodland-grassland ecotone. Experimental soil volumes isolated from ambient precipitation and soil moisture were hand-watered between July 1994 and October 1996. Control plots received mean annual precipitation (602 mm), whereas treated plots received all possible combinations of 50% additions and reductions to mean summer and winter precipitation (n = 4). Increases in summer precipitation increased seedling emergence and recruitment rates as much as threefold, whereas emergence and recruitment were independent of altered winter precipitation regimes. Seedling survival, size, growth, and biomass allocation were largely independent of shifts in seasonal pre cipitation regimes.
   We conclude that Q. emoryi recruitment and subsequent abundance and distribution would more likely be affected by changes in summer precipitation than changes in winter precipitation. For example, increases in summer precipitation that increase rates of seedling emergence and establishment may facilitate downslope shifts in the woodland-grassland ecotone. Similarly, this mechanism may explain downslope shifts in this ecotone that occurred coincident with particularly high summer precipitation during the "Medieval Warm" period, 645-1295 yr BP. Further, whereas soil moisture resource partitioning between adult Q. emoryi and coexisting grasses may contribute to savanna maintenance, soil resource partitioning does not occur within the first three growing seasons after Q. emoryi germination. Results illustrate the importance of consideration of the regeneration niche, which is often overlooked when predicting thr response of woody plants to impending climate change.

AB Mountain lions (Puma concolor) are thought to regulate their populations via social behavior. The proposed mechanism is a land-tenure system that results in exclusion of individuals from the population through territoriality and temporal avoidance. In the absence of mortality from intraspecific aggression, social behavior can regulate a population only by limiting reproduction. Successful reproduction among large mammals is related to the availability of food. Four states of nature must hold if a population is regulated by social behavior via a land-tenure system in mountain lions: (1) individuals should not be distributed randomly, but each should have its own distinct distribution, and those individuals should maintain regions of exclusivity; (2) use of food within the distribution of an individual should not be random, but should be clumped as individuals try to exclude each other from access to prey; (3) those clumps of prey must not be simply the result of prey distribution, but of social interactions among lions; and (4) social interactions and defense of food should occur in regions where distributions of individuals overlap; therefore, prey use by individual lions in areas of overlap should be less than expected based on the distribution of prey.
   We tested hypotheses regarding social regulation for a population of mountain lions that co-occurred on a winter range with a population of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in the eastern Sierra Nevada, California, from 1991 to 1997. Individual mountain lions (rt = 10) exhibited distinct distributions, and deer killed by individuals (n = 112) were not distributed randomly within the distribution of the lion that did the killing. Furthermore, the nonrandom distribution of lion-killed deer could be explained by the distribution of live deer alone, but that result was marginally not significant (P = 0.06) and indicated that something else affected the locations of kills made by lions. Results from tests of whether the presence of another mountain lion affected where individuals chose to kill prey indicated that social interactions had no effect. The distribution of deer killed by individual mountain lions in areas of exclusive use and areas of overlap was identical to that expected based on the distribution of live deer alone. That outcome indicated social behavior was not regulating the population of mountain lions via partitioning of prey, and temporal differences in use of space could nor explain the distribution of mountain lions we observed. A system of land-tenure and mutual avoidance did not limit the population of mountain lions in Round Valley via partitioning of prey. Our results are concordant with other studies of large mammalian carnivores, which reported that populations were not limited primarily by territoriality but by the supply of food.

AB The "connectedness" of clonal plants has been shown to promote survival and growth in a variety of single-species, single-factor studies, but experiments comparing the relative advantages of clonality across multiple habitats and species are rare, raising the concern that generalizations about the benefits of clonality might be biased by the particular species or habitat studied. We studied the importance of clonal integration in southeastern USA salt marsh plants. using all six of the common clonal species in the community, by following the success of intact and severed clonal fragments invading three habitat treatments.
   Clonal integration was most important for growth of clonal fragments invading hypersaline salt pans, likely because parent clones supplied salt-stressed fragments with water; of moderate importance for fragments invading the neighbors-clipped treatment, likely because parent clones supplied fragments with resources enabling rapid exploitation of unused patches; and least important when neighbors were present, consistent with suggestions that size-based asymmetrical competition is relatively unimportant in clonal plants. Our results indicate that the importance of clonal integration can differ between habitats and species within a community. We encourage explicit consideration of these potential sources of variability to best understand the importance of clonal integration in the field.

AB This paper reports the first study of maternal input and care from birth to weaning in a fur seal with a long pup-rearing period: the subantarctic fur seal Arctocephalus tropicalis breeding on the temperate Amsterdam Island, Indian Ocean. The protracted weaning period provided the opportunity for examination of maternal care in relation to seasonal changes in the requirements of the mother-pup pair and environmental conditions. During the reproductive season 1995-1996, maternal care was investigated in terms of provisioning (maternal attendance) pattern while diving effort was investigated using time depth recorders in summer and winter. Maternal input was calculated in terms of the absolute rate of pup mass gain and, ultimately, pup growth rate and pup body mass at weaning. Lactating subantarctic fur seals perform one of the longest attendance cycles described in fur seals, spending on average 11-23 d at sea from summer to winter. The time mothers spend ashore suckling their pup is also long (similar to 4 d) but remains constant throughout the year. Throughout the year, maternal input should be described as follows: mothers spending a long time at sea store a large amount of body reserves that provide them a good body condition. Consequently, they spend a long time ashore to transfer their body reserves to their pups. However, mothers spending short attendance periods increase the mass transfer efficiency, probably by decreasing their metabolic overhead. In summer, maternal care was mostly controlled by pup traits: maternal absences appeared to be controlled by pup fasting ability, while maternal input was controlled by pup ingestion ability, i.e., pup body size and the time the pup was suckling. In fall, pups were no longer limited in milk ingestion, and maternal input was mostly controlled by maternal traits (e.g., body length and experience). In winter, maternal input decreased as the pup became older despite an increase in maternal diving effort. We propose that, in winter, maternal requirements increase, probably in response to increasing costs of gestation and because of a decrease in food resource availability. Pups whose mother performed short and regular foraging trips grew faster and were heavier at weaning than other pups. This is discussed in term of pup fasting endurance and maternal experience. Finally, we found a window of foraging trip durations that maximizes the net rate of energy acquisition of the pup, suggesting that in subantarctic fur seals there may not exist one optimal maternal attendance pattern, but a range of patterns promoting the same maternal fitness.

AB For a species to colonize a site it must both arrive there by dispersal from another site and maintain positive population growth in the local environment. I experimentally tested the role of dispersal limitation in structuring the zooplankton communities of fishless ponds in southwestern Michigan. An average of 12.9 new species of rotifers and crustaceans from the region were introduced at the beginning of the experiment into the intact resident communities of seven ponds in large in situ enclosures (the invasion treatment). Introduced species were found at least once over three months in six of the seven ponds, and one species consistently colonized all three replicate: enclosures in three of the ponds. However, the success rate of the introductions was low as >91% of the species introduced immediately became extinct. In addition, introduced species remained rare throughout the experiment in every pond, comprising only 0-2.5% of total zooplankton community biomass. No effects of the invasion treatment were detected on total zooplankton diversity or biomass, on the biomass of native species, or on chlorophyll a concentration, suggesting that relaxing dispersal limitation for the regional pool had minimal effects on local community structure. Both the biomass of exotic species and the proportion of species introduced that successfully colonized the invasion treatment were negatively correlated with native species diversity. These patterns support the hypothesis that diversity confers resistance to invasion. The results of the invasion treatment indicated a minor role for dispersal limitation in structuring pond zooplankton communities.
   To test the role of interactions with resident species in excluding potential invaders, a second experiment was performed in four different ponds the following year. In addition to the control and invasion treatment, a second treatment (the resistance treatment) was imposed where the abundance of native species was reduced by filtering before the introduction of invaders. The goal of this treatment was to weaken interactions between resident species and invaders while maintaining the abiotic environment intact. Among the four ponds, 3.8 times more exotic species were found in the resistance treatment than in the invasion treatment, and their total biomass was 16.4 times greater. The contrast between the invasion and resistance treatments indicated an important role for species interactions in repelling invaders. The two experiments showed that zooplankton communities were nearly saturated with species and that biotic interactions excluded many potential invaders.

AB In the research presented here, we examine the effects of water velocity and canopy morphology on rates of nutrient uptake by seagrass communities. Ammonium uptake rates for two types of seagrass communities, Halodule wrightii and Thalassia testudinum, are measured over a range of velocity using a field flume. The field flume allows independent measurements of uptake by communities of natural composition and condition. We compare our results with those estimated using empirically derived engineering equations that describe transport processes to rough surfaces in order to explore the possibility that uptake rates can be predicted from these equations. We also investigate the possibility that the seagrass canopy alters the characteristics of water flow within the community, which is reflected by the friction imposed by the canopy (the friction coefficient) on the moving water. Our results indicate that ammonium uptake by seagrass communities is dependent on water velocity. Further, seagrasses affect characteristics of water flow within the community that are reflected in rates of ammonium uptake. Empirically derived engineering equations used with measured friction coefficients yield expected Stanton numbers (a nondimensional ratio of flux to a surface to advection by a surface) that are within 95% of those measured in the field flume. Thus, the capacity of these communities to remove ammonium from the water column can be predicted using empirically derived engineering equations that describe the transport of chemicals between a fluid and a rough surface.

AB Determining the mechanisms by which natural populations are regulated is a key issue in ecology. Identifying the biological causes of density dependence has, however, proved difficult in many systems. In this study we tested whether adults of three species of reef fish (all gobies) suffered density-dependent mortality, and whether the density-dependent component of mortality was caused by predation. We used field experiments to test for density dependence in each prey species, manipulating the presence of predators and prey density in a factorial design. Prey were stocked on replicate patches of reef constructed of natural materials, with each reef receiving a different density of gobies. Predatory fishes were excluded from half of the reefs using a combination of removals and exclusion cages. Survival of the first species, Lythrypnus dalli, was high and density independent on reefs free of predators, but declined rapidly with increasing density on reefs to which predators had access. Density dependence in L. dalli was thus a result of mortality inflicted by predatory fishes. In the second species, Coryphopterus nicholsii, predators caused a large reduction in the survival in one experiment but had a negligible effect in a second experiment. More importantly, though, survival of C. nicholsii was always independent of its density, regardless of predator presence. In the final species. Coryphopterus glaucofraenum, two separate experiments showed that natural changes in adult abundance (experiment 1) and survival of stocked adults (experiment 2) were density-dependent regardless of predator presence. Both experiments thus indicated that the density-dependent component of loss in C. glaucofraenum was caused, at least in part, by an interaction other than predation. The presence, intensity, and biological cause of density-dependent survival were thus strikingly different for each of these three fishes, despite the fact that they are taxonomically closely related and ecologically similar. These findings suggest a need for further studies aimed at predicting under what circumstances different mechanisms of population regulation will operate.

AB "Supply-side" ecology recognizes the potential role that recruitment plays in the local population dynamics of open systems. Apart from the applied fisheries literature, the converse link between adults and the production of cohorts of recruits has received much less attention. We used a hierarchical sampling design to investigate the relationships between adult abundance, fecundity, and rates of larval recruitment by acroporid corals on 33 reefs in five sectors (250-400 km apart) stretching from north to south along the length of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Our goal was to quantify patterns of recruitment at multiple scales, and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we predicted that large-scale patterns of recruitment could be driven by changes in the abundance of adults and/or their fecundity, i.e., that corals exhibit a stock-recruitment relationship. The amount of recruitment by acroporids in each of two breeding seasons varied by more than 35-fold among the five sectors. Adult density varied only twofold among sectors and was not correlated with recruitment at the sector or reef scale. In contrast, fecundity levels (the proportion of colonies on each reef that contained ripe eggs) varied from 15% to 100%, depending on sector, year, and species. Spatial and temporal variation in the fecundity of each of three common Acropora species explained most of the variation (72%) in recruitment by acroporids, indicating that the production of larvae is a major determinant of levels of recruitment at large scales. Once fecundity was accounted for, none of the other variables we examined (sector, reef area, abundance of adults, or year) contributed significantly to variation in recruitment. The relationship between fecundity and recruitment was nonlinear, i.e., rates of recruitment increased disproportionately when and where the proportion of gravid colonies approached 100%. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that enhanced fertilization success and/or predator satiation occurs during mass-spawning events. Furthermore, it implies that small, sublethal changes in fecundity of corals could result in major reductions in recruitment.

AB Birth seasons of ungulates in tropical regions show a complex pattern varying from asynchronous to highly synchronous and at different times of year. We examine the factors determining the phenology and synchrony of birth seasons of 13 species of ungulates in the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania. We propose that phenology of births (time of year) is determined by food supply, whereas birth synchrony (degree of coordination or spread) is an antipredator adaptation that functions in two different ways. High synchrony may occur through "predator satiation" in species with precocious newborn ("followers"), whereas asynchrony may occur through ''predator avoidance" in species with nonprecocial young ("hiders"). We used green biomass of grass or tree shoots and percentage crude protein as measures of food supply. Births were determined from monthly sample counts covering the period 1967-1997. The frequency distribution of births was compared to that predicted by the abundance of green biomass and percentage protein, and by an even and Grant's gazelle births (asynchronous) monthly distribution. Wildbeest, topi, warthhog, differed from all predicted distributions. Another group showed birth distributions similar to that of green biomass food (buffalo, oribi) or the distribution of percentage protein (giraffe, waterbuck, kongoni, zebra). Also giraffe, waterbuck, and Thomson's gazelle showed births spread more evenly through the year. For grazing species the lag in months between birth peak and protein peak is a positive function of metabolic body size whereas the lag with biomass is a negative function of body size. We suggest that small grazers produce their young early in the wet season ahead of the high protein peak, whereas large species produce their young in phase with high biomass and after the protein peak consistent with metabolic requirements. In terms of synchrony, large species in large herds with precocial young (wildebeest, topi, buffalo) have highly synchronized birth seasons consistent with the "predator satiation" hypothesis. Small species living in small groups with nonprecocial young (impala, Thomson's and Grant's gazelle, waterbuck, oribi) have births less synchronized than the food supply, as predicted by the "predator avoidance" hypothesis. In general, food supply determines the phenology of the birth season. Predation appears to shape the synchrony of births through two opposite adaptations. However, no single feature predicts all species' birth distributions. A combination of the phenology of food supply plus antipredator adaptations accounts for most but not all these distributions.

AB Stilbosis quadricustatella leafminers are microlepidopteran specialists of sand-live oak (Quercus geminata). These tiny moths produce one generation per year and have a parasitic life-cycle and long larval stage that develops entirely within la single oak leaf. Differences in host-plant age, phenotype, and phenology generate a coarse-grained, spatially heterogeneous environment for the leafminer population. Previous reciprocal transfers of leafminer eggs among mature oaks revealed that S. quadricustatella are locally adapted to individual oak trees. In this paper we use genetic markers and an extinction-recolonization experiment to explore further variation in leafminer population structure. Allozyme loci indicate significant interdemic genetic structure among recent colonists of new host trees, which weakens in the 10th generation and disappears by the 40th generation. In contrast,adaptive demic structure is evident by the 10th generation and is strong in the 40th generation, despite the potential for substantial intertree dispersal. We propose that host heterogeneity combined with leafminer fidelity to natal trees promotes divergent selection and rapid demic evolution on individual oaks, despite potentially high gene flow between the leafminers inhabiting them.

The statistic tells us which size classes contribute most to the population's total inequality.

AB A physical refuge from the parasitoid Aphytis melinus is provided to the California red scale Aonidiella aurantii by the interior bark substrates of citrus trees, even though scales have lower fitness on bark in the absence of A. melinus. How bark-reared scales escape parasitism was unclear because A. melinus searches the interior of trees as effectively as the exterior. Host identification in A. melinus is mediated by a kairomone, O-caffeoyltyrosine, in scale covers. O-caffeoyltyrosine concentration varies with scale age and rearing conditions. We hypothesized that the reduced acceptance of bark-reared scale may be due, in part, to reduced quantities of O-caffeoyltyrosine in their covers. We reared scales on bark, leaves, and fruit of lemon and orange trees in the field at monthly intervals and then collected the scales and measured them. We bioassayed covers for their acceptability to A. melinus in the laboratory and then determined their O-caffeoyltyrosine content. Even after adjusting for the differences in scale body size, O-caffeoyltyrosine content in bark-reared scale covers was 45-85% less than that in covers of leaf- or fruit-reared scales, depending upon cultivar and rearing date. Covers of bark-reared scales were selected for probing only 40-45% of the time when compared to leaf-reared scales. Covers with the highest levels of O-caffeoyltyrosine were most likely to be selected for probing. We conclude that part of the mechanism by which California red scales on bark avoids discovery is through reduced O-caffeoyltyrosine content in their covers. This reduction is probably a consequence of the reduced nutritional quality of bark as a substrate for scale survival and growth.

AB Fine roots are an important source and sink for nutrients in terrestrial biogeochemistry. We examined the following hypotheses for fine root nutrients by analyzing data from 56 published studies: (1) that there is a general, inverse relationship of fine root nutrient concentrations with root diameter, and (2) that retranslocation of nutrients out of fine roots is minimal. We analyzed nutrient concentrations of roots less than or equal to 5 mm in diameter as a function of root diameter and root status (live, dead, and undifferentiated), including a comparison for coniferous and broad-leaved trees. For fine roots <2 mm in diameter, average C:N and C:N:P ratios were 43:1 and 522:12:1, significantly narrower than for 2-5 mm roots (79:1 and 920:12:1). Live roots <2 mm in diameter contained significantly more N, P, and Mg and less C than did roots 2-5 mm in diameter, but no significant differences were observed for K or Ca. Mean N and P concentrations were 11.0 and 0.9 g/kg, respectively, for live roots <2 mm diameter, compared to 6.5 and 0.6 g/kg in roots 2-5 mm in diameter. Mean N concentrations in live and dead fine roots were identical and may imply little retranslocation of root N with senescence, but conflicting evidence from Ca:N ratios highlights the need for further research. These results have practical implications for various ecological methods and for the representation of roots in biogeochemical models.

AB Humic lakes with high inputs of allochthonous dissolved organic carbon have a pelagic food chain that, to a large extent, is based on bacterioplankton energy mobilization from allochthonous organic carbon compounds. This is in contrast to clear lakes in which total pelagic production is based mainly on phytoplankton photosynthesis. The energy economy in humic lakes may be less efficient than in clear lakes, because it is Likely that one more link is included in the food chain. Lake data from Scandinavia and North America demonstrate that shifts between food chains based on heterotrophic production and food chains based on primary production can take place at moderate increases or decreases in the concentration of dissolved organic carbon from allochthonous sources. Large variations in the loading of allochthonous organic carbon (e.g., due to climatic variations) may have considerable effects on the biostructure and productivity of lakes.

AB Spatiotemporal variation in the wind-generated dispersion pattern of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) seeds was examined by placing seed traps up to 110 m away from a small. isolated stand in Israel during six successive dispersal seasons. Subsequent recruitment was surveyed two years later. Of the 5487 seeds, 97% were trapped 120 m from the nearest adult tree. Seasonal dispersal curves were consistently right-skewed and leptokurtic. The inverse power law and the negative exponential model accounted for a similar fraction of the variation in the number of dispersed seeds at different distances (79-86% and 76-88%, respectively). Seed dispersal rates varied significantly among seasons. Eighty saplings (3-5 yr old) became established during the three years of the study, most within 15 m of the nearest canopy, some farther away, and none directly under the tree canopies. The estimated probability of seed survival to sapling stage increased significantly with increasing distance from adults, as predicted by the escape hypothesis.
   Winds varied significantly between seasons. generating significant interseasonal variation in seed deposition patterns far from, but not near to, adult trees. Coefficients of variation of seed dispersal rates were lower near adult trees than farther away. Both Moran's I correlograms and partial Mantel tests revealed interseasonal consistency in seed deposition patterns for the total study area and for the area near adult trees but showed considerable variation farther away. We suggest that the low spatiotemporal variation near adults and the high variation far away act to intensify the effects of predation (by increasing the efficiency of predators near adults and reducing it far away) and competition (by increasing the intensity of seedling competition near adults and reducing it far away) in structuring the observed survivorship curve predicted by the escape hypothesis.

AB Associational resistance occurs when herbivore damage to a focal plant is reduced by the presence of other plant species. Neighboring plants can reduce herbivore damage (1) by their effects on the predator community, (2) by reducing the ability of herbivores to find their host plants, and (3) by reducing the time herbivores remain on their host plants. We examined how the presence of the aromatic low shrub Myrica gale and of predatory lady beetles affected herbivore damage and reproductive output in a population of the perennial herb Lythrum salicaria in northern Sweden. An observational study showed that L. salicaria growing in Myrica thickets were less damaged by herbivores, had a lower abundance of the monophagous, leaf-feeding, chrysomelid beetle Galerucella calmariensis, and had higher flower and seed production than L. salicaria outside Myrica thickets. To test whether these differences could be explained by (a) differences in some aspect of plant quality, or (b) differences in predator abundance, we placed Dotted L. salicaria within and outside Myrica thickets. To determine whether differences in the abundance of G. calmariensis were primarily the result of different rates of colonization or emigration, we marked adult beetles and placed them on a second set of potted plants in the two microhabitats. The results show that differences in herbivore abundance, plant damage, and reproductive output between potted L. salicaria placed within and outside Myrica thickets were in the same direction and of the same magnitude as those observed for naturally occurring plants, indicating that the observed patterns were not an effect of differences in the chemical composition of the host plant. Moreover, we found no support for the hypothesis that a higher abundance of insect predators could explain the lower abundance of G. calmariensis on L. salicaria in Myrica thickets. On the contrary, lady beetles (Coccinella quinqempunctata and Coccinella septempunctata) were observed on a greater proportion of the plants placed outside the Myrica thickets. The monitoring of marked beetles indicated that differences in the abundance of G. calmariensis were the result of a markedly higher colonization rate and a somewhat lower emigration rate from L. salicaria outside Myrica thickets. Outside the Myrica thickets, the survival of G. calmariensis and the magnitude of herbivore damage were lower, and fruit and seed output were higher on plants with observations of lady beetles than on plants without lady beetles. The results indicate that the abundance of the specialist herbivore G. calmariensis, and the herbivore damage and reproductive output of its host plant, L. salicaria, are affected both by the presence of the nonhost Myrica and by predation From lady beetles. We suggest that the most likely mechanism causing decreased feeding on L. salicaria growing in Myrica thickets is that Myrica affects the ability of G. calmariensis to find its host, either through visual or olfactory interference.

AB I recorded mast production by oaks (Quercus sp.) at 12 forested sites in western Virginia for 6-12 yr and measured its impact on the abundance of small mammals, understory vegetation, and artificial-nest predation. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were excluded from half the 4-ha sites after at least one season of data collection. My hypothesis was that annual variation in acorn crops affected multiple species and that the strength of those interactions is mediated by white-tailed deer.
   The acorn crop was variable across sites and year, with some of the between-site variability explained by differences in elevation. All sites experienced at least one mast failure, and mast failure years were generally consistent across sites. White-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus), and gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) populations were significantly correlated with annual fluctuations in the acorn crop. The exclusion of deer had a significant impact on P. leucopus and T, striatus populations by increasing the number of animals captured following low acorn mast years.
   Annual fluctuations in the acorn crop, but not in rodent densities, were significantly correlated with the rates of predation on artificial nests the next summer. There was no significant interaction between predation rates and the exclusion of deer. An index from the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) for Virginia was used to measure regional numbers for 11 common species captured at the sites. The index for two understory species was significantly negatively correlated with the mean acorn crop measured 2 yr previously. The effect of white-tailed deer on the forest community was not consistent across all conditions, as sites with large acorn crops were not strongly influenced by deer. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that mast crops from oaks serve as important determinants of community function within Appalachian forests.

AB Biogeochemistry of terrestrial ecosystems is controlled by interactions among factors operating at several spatial and temporal scales. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative importance and interaction of relatively static landscape factors and more dynamic factors in a shortgrass steppe landscape. The landscape factors examined were topographic position, and soil texture. The dynamic factors studied were seasonal climate and the localized effects of individual plants on soils. Patterns were evaluated by sampling soil between and under individual Bouteloua gracilis plants in paired upland (erosional) and lowland (depositional) plots at eight locations at the Central Plains Experimental Range (CPER), Colorado. We quantified five organic C and N pools (total, fine and coarse particulate organic matter [POM], mineral-associated organic matter [MAOM], and potentially mineralizable C and N), and we estimated seasonal patterns of in situ N dynamics with three methods (extractable inorganic N, net N mineralization in uncovered cores, and N adsorbed on ion exchange resin [IER] bags).
   Topographic position and soil texture each explained much of the landscape-scale variation of C and N pools and vegetation structure. Most lowland plots were enriched in silt, clay, C, and N relative to adjacent upland plots, and topographic position affected most pools significantly. Most vegetation and biogeochemical variables were strongly correlated with soil sand content. Across the range of sand content encountered (40-83%), the fraction of area in bare soil openings >5 cm across increased sevenfold, and most C and N fractions increased by 2-4.5 times. Plant-induced, microscale heterogeneity of soil C and N was comparable in magnitude to landscape-scale heterogeneity for pools with more rapid turnover (POM and mineralizable C and N), but presence or absence of plants did not affect more stable, mineral-associated organic matter. Plant-induced heterogeneity was significant in all locations, but its importance likely decreases with decreasing sand content as cover becomes more continuous, particularly in lowlands.
   Total extractable inorganic N and nitrate, N adsorbed on resin bags, and the proportion of mineralized N that was nitrified during incubations increased with increasing soil water content or precipitation, but net N mineralization did not vary systematically with precipitation. Inorganic N availability was greatest during relatively moist spring periods, and these were the only times when indices of in situ N availability followed the spatial patterns expected from laboratory assays of C and N pool distribution.
   The relatively weak spatial patterns for N dynamics contrast with the substantial landscape and individual-plant scale variation in C and N pools. Landscape patterns of N mineralization and availability may be tied to N pools, such as POM N, that are not strongly related to topography or texture. Particulate organic matter appears to be especially important to N retention and availability on sandy soils, which typify most sites at the CPER; the proportion of total N residing in POM was high and POM C:N ratios were low in sandy upland soils.
   We suggest that soil texture is a key proximal control over biogeochemical processes and is largely responsible for observed landscape-scale patterns, including topographic differences. Models that integrate effects of texture and topography have the potential to link landscape biogeochemical patterns to short-term processes that directly influence SOM dynamics and to long-term geomorphic processes that influence soil distribution, including eolian redistribution of soil materials, which is important in many dry regions.

AB Eigenvalues, the solutions to the characteristic polynomial, are important measures of community behavior. Their range and practical measurement present difficult challenges in ecology, We therefore present the derivation of variance of eigenvalues of the community matrix, var(lambda) = var (a(ii)) + (n - 1)a(ij)a(ji), as well as a novel related formula, namely, the expectancy of pairwise eigenvalues (EPV), var(lambda (pairwise)) = var(a(ii-pairwise)) + a(ij)a(ji). We propose that the two formulae may be useful in evaluating the relative contributions of inter- and intraspecific effects on the behavior of large systems. EPV allows estimating eigenvalue distribution of systems of unknown size.

   SELECTION
AB Under the influence of natural and sexual selection, males and females will often differ in the costs and benefits of achieving some particular body size; we might therefore expect to find them growing at different rates for different times, and dying on different schedules. The analysis of sexual dimorphism presented here assumes that life histories are optimized over three key variables: activity level (or "effort") during the juvenile stage, duration of the juvenile stage, and size at maturation. Reproduction is taken to be semelparous (or monocarpic), reproductive success is size dependent, and females are demographically dominant. Juvenile male and female life histories are assumed to be "structurally identical" (i.e., governed by identical functions of activity, size, and development time). Under these conditions, sexually dimorphic life histories readily arise when features of juvenile behavior and development are adjusted to maximize r in response to gender-specific selection pressures on adults.
   Some conclusions from the analysis are as follows:
   1) Seasonal constraints that force males and females to have equal development times cause differences between the sexes in other characteristics.
   2) The survival cost of greater body size generates a sex ratio at maturation favoring the smaller sex, consistent with much empirical evidence.
   3) The relationships among size, growth rate, and development time can be represented graphically in a way that permits sexually dimorphic life histories to be depicted and compared. Cases considered here indicate considerable diversity among these patterns.
   4) An allometric growth function is derived to facilitate graphical and mathematical analysis of body size.
   5) The reproductive size quotient, an indicator of reproductive potential relative to body size, is defined and shown to be a significant life history characteristic. Except when mortality rate is strongly related to size at maturation, or when generation time is fixed, the reproductive size quotient should be maximized, and these maxima should be the same for males and females.

AB Facilitation of tree establishment by nurse shrubs, which ameliorate otherwise unfavorable microenvironmental conditions, is a widely studied phenomenon. However. relatively little is known about how facilitative influences change in relation to interannual climatic variability. In northern Patagonia, Argentina, we examined influences of potential nurse shrubs on the establishment of the conifer Austrocedrus chilensis and assessed the significance of those influences to establishment during years of contrasting climate. We also experimentally investigated the effects of nurse shrubs and different water availability on tree seedling emergence and survival.
   A strong spatial association of Austrocedrus juveniles with shrubs, both beneath shrub canopies and near shrub canopies, indicates that shrubs favorably influence tree regeneration and that in some habitats and time periods nurse plants appear to be required for successful tree seedling establishment. Protection from direct sunlight was the main factor contributed by shrubs that enhanced the germination and survival of Austrocedrus. During the 1995-1996 experiment, no seedlings survived in the unwatered interspaces between shrubs, whereas maximal survival was obtained by watering seedlings at shaded sites.
   The results of this study indicate that in the Patagonian ecotone the Strength of facilitative associations between shrubs and Austrocedrus juveniles closely tracks annual climatic variability. During extremely warm dry years, recruitment of Austrocedrus is nil with or without protection by nurse shrubs. During cool wet years, establishment may occur both beneath shrubs and in open interspaces: however, during average years, which are still years with substantial drought stress, establishment of Austrocedrus appears to require nurse shrubs.

AB The comparative phenotypic plasticity of 16 species of tropical rainforest shrubs (genus Psychotria, Rubiaceae) was investigated by growing plants in three light environments on Barro Colorado Island (BCI, Panama). The three light environments gave daily photon flux densities (PPFD) similar to the natural light gradient from shaded forest understory to small and large canopy gaps. Six of the species are principally found in gaps or forest edge environments, whereas the other ten species are principally found in shaded understories. Interactions between light treatment and species resulted in unpredictable mean phenotypic expression across light treatments. Shoot relative growth rates (RGR) were similar for understory and gap species in the low light treatment. Gap species had significantly greater shoot RGR in the intermediate light treatment than in the high light treatment. Mean plasticity was significantly lower for morphological variables when com pared to physiological variables, while variation in plasticity was significantly greater for structural variables. Significant differences between gap and understory species were found in the plasticity of six out of the seven variables. The mean phenotypic plasticity of the seven variables was significantly greater for gap than for understory species. The high plasticity of gap species was consistent with the hypothesis that specialization in a more favorable environment increases plasticity. The species exhibited a wide range of leaf longevities, from four to 29 months, with gap species having, on average, shorter leaf lifespan than understory species. Mean phenotypic plasticity decreased with increasing leaf longevity. Selection for greater plasticity may be stronger in the gap species because gaps exhibit a relatively predictable decrease in PPFD for which plasticity could be adaptive. While we have found a significant correlation between phenotypic plasticity and habitat affiliation, phylogeny (subgenus ascription) was not correlated with plasticity or with plant performance in any given PPFD treatment, reinforcing the hypothesis that phenotypic plasticity has evolved through natural selection in this diverse genus.

AB I present a null model that can be used for detecting nonrandom patterns of species richness along spatial gradients, such as latitude and elevation. Because estimates of species richness along a single spatial gradient are nonindependent, tests of statistical inference should not be applied. The null model described here circumvents this problem of nonindependence by randomly placing the actual range width of each species along the gradient. The simulated richness curve generated in this way can be compared to an "average" random curve composed of many such simulations. The comparison involves measuring the mean displacement (D) of the simulated curve from the average random curve. By repeating these steps a specified number of times, one can obtain a distribution of D values. The displacement of the actual species richness curve from the average random curve can also be determined and compared to the distribution of D values of the simulated random curves. This comparison allows one to determine whether the actual curve is random. The null model was found to be very powerful (power > 0.96) for curves consisting of at least 10 richness estimates from a total pool of 20 or more species.

AB We examined patterns of seedling recruitment and their underlying mechanisms in a population of Chrysophyllum sp. nov. (Sapotaceae), a shade-tolerant canopy species in mature tropical rainforest in Queensland, Australia. We considered spatial scales ranging from 1 m(2) to 1 ha, and temporal scales ranging from 1 to 32 yr. Over the 32-yr study period there were six episodes of very high seedling recruitment (masts) at intervals ranging from 4 to 10 yr. Less than 2% of new recruits were found in the nine censuses in other years. We found no significant correlations between the numbers of seedlings per census and either seasonal or annual rainfall, number of dry months per year, or El Nifio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events but found two correlations with mean seasonal air temperatures in the years preceding flowering. There were long-term changes in abundance in both time and space. In 1965 there were 163 seedling-sized plants in two dense patches, whereas in 1996, there were 4000 in 15 patches. Once a new patch became established, seedlings recruited there in each succeeding mast episode. Adult trees varied in their production of seedlings. Only 25% of the trees in the sample analyzed participated in all mast years; others had few seedlings for up to 28 yr before beginning to produce many seedlings. Seedlings were shade tolerant. They grew extremely slowly in the shaded understory, mean height only doubling in 27 yr. They were also quite long-lived; 6% of seedlings recruited in 1969 were still alive 27 yr later. There was little effect of natural enemies on seeds or seedlings.
   We found weak positive and negative effects of density on seed germination, seedling mortality, and growth. Mortality rates of Chrysophyllum seedlings did not show any trends with time, nor with distance from conspecific adults. These results suggest that abundance of older stages is determined by recruitment as well as subsequent growth and mortality. Mortality rates of seedlings of species other than Chrysophyllum decreased with distance from adult Chrysophyllum trees. Under present conditions, the Chrysophyllum population may be increasing in relation to that of other species, perhaps leading to a reduction in tree diversity in this tropical rainforest.

AB Tracking vertebrate-dispersed seeds from parent plant to deposition site remains a primary obstacle to understanding the ecological and evolutionary consequences of seed dispersal. We evaluate a new and simple technique for tracking seeds. Fluorescent microspheres (15 mu m diameter) are applied to fruits and later recovered in fecal material associated with the fruits' seeds. Trials with captive Cedar Waxwings (Bombycilla cedrorum) demonstrated that (1) percentage recovery of microspheres is high, (2) all defecations containing seeds also contain microspheres, (3) relatively few microspheres are recovered in defecations not containing seeds, and (4) presence of microspheres on fruits does not affect fruit choice. Field trials with five species of fruits demonstrated that, after similar to 30 d under full sun and high temperatures, photodegradation limits one's ability to detect microspheres, The field trials also showed that an anti-transpirant applied with the microspheres allows them to adhere to fruits without deterring fruit consumption or damaging fruits and that microspheres can be found in fecal samples of wild birds. Our technique is likely to be applicable to any study in which it is necessary to link fecal material with a particular source of food or an individual animal.

AB In birds, the annual mean clutch size is often negatively correlated with population density. This relationship is at least in part due to adjustment by individuals. We investigated whether this response is adaptive in two ways. First we used an optimality model to predict how optimal clutch size (the clutch size that maximizes the number of breeding birds [recruits and surviving parents] in the next season) varies with density. We parameterized the model using data on fitness consequences of experimental variation in brood size and natural variation in population density in a Great Tit (Parus major) population. Predicted optimal clutch size decreased with density, but the predicted relationship was stronger than the observed relationship. Second, we investigated the relationship between the annual selection differential for clutch size and density. We found no relationship, indicating that there is no selection for a steeper than observed relationship between clutch size and density. This implies that the observed response is adaptive, and that the prediction of the optimality model lacks some important constraints or selection pressures. We further used the optimality model to examine the sensitivity of the optimal clutch size to density at different stages in the reproductive cycle. This analysis suggested that the nestling stage was most important. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study that makes quantitative predictions of optimal dutch size in relation to population density.

AB Despite the importance of understanding persistence, there are few direct tests of the ability of models to predict predator and prey population persistence. We tested whether an individual-based model could forecast the dynamics and time to extinction in aquatic microcosms of a protist predator and prey: predatory Didinium nasutum and bacterivorous Colpidium striatum. By addressing both persistence and dynamics, the model increases the testability of mechanisms of extinction. Population-level equations modeled the functional response and prey growth. For individual predators, we simulated time since dividing and feeding, and number of prey consumed; these influenced the timing of division and death. We tested the model by comparing simulated dynamics to data from three experiments.: (1) an experiment initiated with low predator-prey ratios in 30-mL bottles; (2) an experiment similar to Experiment 1, but in which immigrant predators, prey, or both were added during the first density cycle; (3) an experiment in 30-mL bottles, initiated with various predator-prey ratios.
   Using only nine parameters measured in independent experiments, simulations gave satisfactory predictions of the period and amplitude of cycles of predator and prey densities, and predator and prey densities through time for Experiment 1. Adding stochasticity to the model also allowed it to reproduce observed prey and predator persistence and the proportion of replicates with prey extinctions. We used the improved model to forecast the results of Experiments 2 and 3. In Experiment 2, persistence changed with immigration. The model qualitatively reproduced these changes but underestimated their magnitude. Increasing the initial predator-prey ratio reduced persistence in Experiment 3. Simulations failed to qualitatively reproduce these results for 30-mL microcosms, unless we raised initial prey density.
   This study demonstrates the use of an individual-based model to help identify and test mechanisms of extinction in predator-prey interactions. The combination of individual-based and population-level formalisms can maintain both model tractability and a close working relationship between models and accessible data.

AB If causes of population fluctuation vary temporally, then tests that search for density dependence in long time series cannot distinguish, at any given time, how much population change is due to density-dependent or density-independent factors. For some species' dynamics, however, it is possible to determine over a restricted period whether density-dependent factors are involved in reducing population densities. I use a new Return Trajectory Likelihood Ratio Test (RTLRT) to determine whether a population perturbed to high density (e.g., by periodic recruitment) exhibits density dependence by returning to a positive asymptote (or leveling density, L) or is density independent and, through proportional hazards, approaches zero exponentially.
   In a series of simulations, declines after recruitment were mimicked by creating sequences that changed due to a combination of density-dependent and density-independent factors. Until the sequence dropped below L, losses due to each mortality type were combined; after that point the density-dependent component was discontinued. The power of the test was assessed over a range of decline rates (e(-b), where b = 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, 1) to zero and to L, initial density values (2, 4, and 6 times higher than L), and observation and process errors (e(sigma) where sigma = 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5). Test size was assessed by generating trajectories with no density-dependent decline.
   These simulations identified four critical parameters that influence the likelihood of detecting density-dependent decline. (1) Detection rates change with the ratio of initial recruitment peak to leveling density: high peaks generally increase detection, although they may decrease detection of slow density-dependent declines. (2) High rates of density-dependent decline relative to density-independent decline also improve detection, except that populations rapidly dropping below L will appear density independent regardless of dynamics governing change prior to that time. (3) Error reduces detection of density dependence, except when declines are shallow and process error is assumed. (4) Slow rates of density-independent decline (to <10% of original value) cause the RTLRT to detect density dependence when it is not present (i.e., size is excessive for slow declines).
   As an example of how the RTLRT may be used, I apply it to four years of monthly counts of an intertidal isopod, Idotea wosnesenskii, which recruits annually to high densities under boulders. Based on the RTLRT, subsequent declines were density dependent in some years, although detection differed with the assumption of process or observation error, and with the use of separate or averaged samples. In addition to density dependence, selective mortality of one class of individuals or mortality balanced by continuing low immigration could also cause steep declines to L. For isopods, however, densities were higher under boulders with small depressions than under smooth controls, suggesting that declines may occur when densities exceed the number of safe sites available. The postrecruitment decline of I. wosnesenskii appears to be at least partially density dependent.

AB Classification and regression trees are ideally suited for the analysis of complex ecological data. For such data, we require flexible and robust analytical methods, which can deal with nonlinear relationships, high-order interactions, and missing values. Despite such difficulties, the methods should be simple to understand and give easily interpretable results. Trees explain variation of a single response variable by repeatedly splitting the data into more homogeneous groups, using combinations of explanatory variables that may be categorical and/or numeric. Each group is characterized by a typical value of the response variable, the number of observations in the group, and the values of the explanatory variables that define it. The tree is represented graphically, and this aids exploration and understanding.
   Trees can be used for interactive exploration and for description and prediction of patterns and processes. Advantages of trees include: (1) the flexibility to handle a broad range of response types, including numeric, categorical, ratings, and survival data; (2) invariance to monotonic transformations of the explanatory variables, (3) ease and robustness of construction; (4) ease of interpretation; and (5) the ability to handle missing values in both response and explanatory variables. Thus, trees complement or represent an alternative to many traditional statistical techniques, including multiple regression, analysis of variance, logistic regression, log-linear models, linear discriminant analysis, and survival models.
   We use classification and regression trees to analyze survey data from the Australian central Great Barrier Reef, comprising abundances of soft coral taxa (Cnidaria: Octocorallia) and physical and spatial environmental information. Regression tree analyses showed that dense aggregations, typically formed by three taxa, were restricted to distinct habitat types, each of which was defined by combinations of 3-4 environmental variables. The habitat definitions were consistent with known experimental findings on the nutrition of these tars. When used separately, physical and spatial variables were similarly strong predictors of abundances and lost little in comparison with their joint use. The spatial variables are thus effective surrogates for the physical variables in this extensive reef complex, where information on the physical environment is often not available.
   Finally, we compare the use of regression trees and linear models for the analysis of these data and show how Linear models fail to find patterns uncovered by the trees.

AB Assemblages of coexisting species are formed by immigration from a regional pool of colonists and local interactions among species and with the physical environment. Theory suggests that the shape of the relationship between regional and local species richness may indicate the relative roles of dispersal and local interactions in limiting local diversity. Here we examine patterns of regional and local species richness in freshwater crustacean zooplankton to test whether linear (suggesting dispersal limitation) or curvilinear (suggesting saturation, via strong local control) functions best fit the data, Local richness appeared saturated when regions of different spatial extents were included on the same graph, However, this pattern was influenced by differences in scale among surveys. We corrected for the effects of regional scale by plotting mean local richness against the residuals of the species-landscape area relations. Controlling for the extent of the regional scale produced much more linear patterns, suggesting strong dispersal limitation, We present a simple graphical model to explain how variation among surveys in the geographic size of regions can produce apparent saturation of local diversity even if the underlying pattern of local and regional richness is linear. We also compare the predictive power of residual regional richness on local richness with that of several local features in a multiple regression model. Local richness exhibits strong relationships with both residual regional richness and pH.
   We argue that the relative strengths of local and regional processes depend on the definition of the regional scale. A variety of evidence suggests that local processes play a major role in generating differences in zooplankton diversity among lakes within a biogeographic region. Evidence for the importance of dispersal limitation comes largely from comparisons of lakes across very large scales. Our analysis suggests that linear patterns of local and regional diversity are not incompatible with strong local interactions.

AB Ficus and their species-specific pollinator wasps (Agaonidae) form a remarkable plant-insect obligate mutualism. Each monoecious fig species also shelters a community of nonpollinating chalcids, composed of both gallmakers and parasitoids. The few previous studies that took these species into account aimed at determining their potential effect on the mutualism. To go further, we argue that the fig wasps represent an interesting model for studies of community ecology. Figs and fig wasps of different groups were studied in Cote d'Ivoire to quantify local ecological interactions.
   Regardless of their fig host or taxonomical position, we identified three ecological groups of nonpollinating fig wasps on the basis of their timing of oviposition in the fig and on their oviposition behavior Pollinating and nonpollinating fig wasps were shown to interact intimately and to have a significant effect on the host plant in at least some cases. Each species of the community seems to preferentially oviposit in a part of the female flowers, depending on their depth inside the fig. Convergence in fig exploitation thus exists in various chalcid lineages, and the community structure and organization are very similar between fig species. Concepts developed in parasitoid community ecology could now be tested on this promising model.

AB We tested the fundamental assumption of the "optimality paradigm" that the foraging behavior of individual organisms corresponds to what we would expect if it had been honed by natural selection to match habitat differences in reproductive success. First, we used long-term studies of life history and habitat selection in white-footed mice to illustrate that the fitness of females living in the forest is greater than that of females living in forest-edge habitat. Second, we used short-term foraging studies to evaluate whether food patches located in the forest provided more value to foragers than did those in the edge. Third, we used foraging studies and data on the occurrence of predators to demonstrate that animals foraging in areas with little cover face higher risks than when they forage in areas with more cover. We confirmed three a priori predictions: (1) Individual mice abandoned foraging patches at higher harvest rates in edge habitat than they did in forest. (2) Individuals harvested resource patches to lower quitting harvest rates under cover than they did when patches were located in the open. (3) The difference in quitting-harvest rate between "open" and "covered" patches was less in the safe forest habitat than it was in the risky edge habitat. Our results yield an impressive fit with our previous knowledge of habitat differences in reproductive success and substantiate the premise that short-duration strategic decisions by individuals match habitat differences in fitness.

AB Species differences in seedling survival in deeply shaded understories (i.e., shade tolerance) may depend on both seed size and growth rates, but their relative contributions to survival and how they change with time and with variation in light and below-ground resource availability is unknown. With a greenhouse experiment we investigated these relationships by examining responses of growth, growth-related morphology, survival, and their interrelationships to a range of nitrogen (3.4 x 10(-9)-3.4 x 10(-3) mol/L N fertilizer solutions) and low light (0.6-7.3% of open sky) availabilities for young seedlings of 10 North American toe species that vary in observational shade tolerance rankings and seed size (Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera, Betula alleghaniensis, Acer saccharum, Larix laricina, Pinus banksiana. Pinus resinosa, Pinus strobus, Picea mariana, and Abies balsamea).
   Within all species, relative growth rate (RGR) and survival increased with light. RGR and survival also increased with N supply but only at the two highest light levels, and then only for the shade-intolerant, broad-leaved Populus and Betula spp.. In every species, survival was positively related to RGR. Moreover, each species differed in the relationship of survival to RGR, and these differences were related to seed mass: at any given RGR, large-seeded, shade-tolerant species had higher survival than smaller-seeded, intolerant ones.
   Across species, in most light and N treatments, seed mass was positively related to young seedling survival, but RGR was not. In very low light the relative benefits of greater seed mass to survival were temporary. As seedlings aged, interspecific mortality rates became more dependent on observational shade tolerance rankings than on seed size, but mortality was still unrelated to RGR.
   Our results indicate potentially important interactions among light, N, and species that could influence regeneration dynamics. For young seedlings in deeply shaded microsites, N supply does not matter, and only shade-tolerant species survive due, in part, to large seeds and physiological traits other than RGR. In moderate shade, RGR is greater, and survival is high for all species, except that small-seeded, broad-leaved, intolerant species have low survival and RGR at low N supply. This suggests that broad-leaved shade-intolerant species compete more effectively in moderate shade on richer soils than on poorer soils. Although we found that both seed mass and vegetative physiology influenced survival in shade, they did nor covary tightly, suggesting that they are under somewhat separate selection pressures.

AB Polar bears live in high-latitude environments characterized by cyclic variation in form and extent of sea ice. From 1991 to 1995, we used radio telemetry and monthly satellite images to compare patterns of ice selection by 110 female polar bears, relative to two geographic regions and four seasons. We hypothesized that extreme seasonal changes in ice characteristics in the Baffin Bay region, including a period of open water, may limit polar bear density despite supporting greater prey density than the Archipelago region, where ice is present year-round. Using cyclic time series analysis to model seasonal variation, we found differences in level, amplitude, and phase between sea ice characteristics and habitat selection by polar bears of the Arctic Archipelago and Baffin Bay regions. Polar bears not only followed seasonal changes, but they anticipated seasonal fluctuations, e.g., polar bears were found close to ice edges in spring in advance of the peak availability of edges. Also, seasonal selection of sea ice by polar bears was generally of a larger amplitude than cycles in ice and is best explained by intensive use of specific ice types in spring and summer, and sparse use during the remaining year. During spring and summer, Archipelago bears used landfast ice more intensively, whereas Baffin bears used moving ice, defined as thick first-year ice found in large flees. Both ice types likely represent areas where most seal pupping occurred in spring for each region. Bears from both regions selected first-year ice in winter when new ice was forming and multiyear ice in autumn when maximum ice melt had occurred. Overall, polar bear selection of ice habitat was similar between regions despite major differences in seasonal ice characteristics. Polar bear density may not directly relate to prey density, due to the limited ability of bears to track the extreme seasonal fluctuations in ice extent found in more productive environments.

AB The physicochemical environment can strongly constrain the outcome of ecological interactions such as predation, mating, and competition. This is especially true of processes mediated by the sense of olfaction, because wind and water currents control the dispersal of odor signals and act as ancillary cues during odor plume following. In the field, we examined how variations in the physical and chemical properties of odor plumes would alter the foraging behavior of the blue crab Callinectes sapidus a common predator/scavenger in tidal marsh creeks in the southeastern United States. We video-recorded responses of naturally foraging crabs to odor plumes of varying composition and odor release rare (characteristic of clams of differing size). During each trial we presented crabs with an experimental plume that was a mixture of fluorescein-dyed seawater and clam mantle fluid, oyster mantle fluid, or a suite of amino acids, and a control plume which consisted of dyed seawater only. In addition to manipulating the chemical composition and odor release rate of the plume, we allowed flow speed to vary naturally with the tide. We tested for effects of odor composition, odor release rater and flow speed on the success (i.e., finding the target) and efficiency (i.e., search path direction) of blue crab foraging. Mantle fluid solutions and wounded prey items elicited active search and upstream walking, while control and amino acid solutions had no effect on crab behavior. Odors released at a low rate (either low volume flow or low concentration) elicited fewer responses from crabs, and the resulting search was less efficient and less successful than responses to odors released at higher rates. Ambient current speed also affected both starch success and efficiency. There was a decline in search success when current speed in the tidal channel was below 1 cm/s: search success remained constantly high, however, when current speed was above this threshold. Search efficiency was directly proportional to ambient current speeds. Such relationships between hydrodynamic and chemical properties of the environment and foraging success and efficiency suggest that variation in the physicochemical environment can influence the detectability of prey and strategies employed by foragers. These results extend beyond the foraging of marine crustaceans into other olfactory-mediated interactions and habitats.

AB Although many theoretical and observational studies suggest that diverse systems are more resistant to invasion by novel species than are less diverse systems, experimental data are uncommon. In this experiment, I manipulated the functional group richness and composition of a grassland community to test two related hypotheses: (1) Diversity and invasion resistance are positively related through diversity's effects on the resources necessary for invading plants' growth. (2) Plant communities resist invasion by species in functional groups already present in the community. To test these hypotheses, I removed plant functional groups (forbs, C-3 graminoids, and C-4 graminoids) from existing grassland vegetation to create communities that contained all possible combinations of one, two, or three functional groups. After three years of growth, I added seeds of 16 different native prairie species (legumes, nonleguminous forbs, C-3 graminoids, and C-4 graminoids) to a 1 x 1 m portion of each 4 x 8 m plot. Overall invasion success was negatively related to resident functional group richness, but there was only weak evidence that resident species repelled functionally similar invaders. A weak effect of functional group richness on some resources did not explain the significant diversity-invasibility relationship. Other factors, particularly the different responses of resident functional groups to the initial disturbance of the experimental manipulation, seem to have been more important to community invasibility.

AB When animals are more active they encounter both more food and more predators. Thus, activity rates mediate a trade-off between growth rates and predation risk. Models of the trade-off generally, but not exclusively, predict reduced activity when resource availability increases or when predation risk increases. In a laboratory setting, we videotaped larvae of four species of ranid frogs (bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana; green frog, R. clamitans; leopard frog, R. pipiens; and wood frog, R. sylvatica). Changes in activity level in response to changes in food and predator density were measured. Overall, species reduced both the proportion of time active and swimming speed with increases in resource level and predator density. These effects were additive. Regardless of food level, additional predators reduced activity levels similar amounts in all four species. Larger animals, which are less vulnerable to predation, were more active than smaller animals. Leopard frog and wood frog larvae, which are characteristic of more temporary waters, responded more strongly to variation in food levels than did bullfrog and green frog larvae.

AB We report on the spatial scaling of body size distributions in the mammalian fauna of South America, exclusive of fully aquatic or volant species. Although the frequency distribution of body sizes for 720 species of South American mammals was qualitatively similar to that observed for 464 species of North American mammals, different patterns emerged at smaller spatial scales in these two regions. At smaller scales in North America, body size frequency distributions became progressively more uniform on a log axis, whereas they remained modal with decreasing spatial scale in neotropical rain forest, and the mode shifted to larger body sizes. This unexpected scaling relationship appears to reflect the addition of a substantial third habitat dimension: the rain forest canopy. When rain forest mammals were separated by foraging stratum (terrestrial, scansorial, and arboreal), distributions of body sizes within strata exhibited scaling relationships similar to those observed in temperate areas of North and South America. These results are consistent with earlier interpretations of body size scaling across large geographic or taxonomic ranges, but they emphasize the pivotal role that habitat structure and heterogeneity can play in the ecological and evolutionary development of faunas. Additionally, these results underscore the role of habitat complexity as a factor contributing to the latitudinal gradient in species richness.

AB The invariability of animal-pollinated flowers relative to vegetative organs, such as leaves, suggests that these flowers may have been finely tuned for an optimum pollination performance. The evolutionary mechanism that could optimize and conserve a species' flower architecture is stabilizing selection, which occurs when intermediate phenotypes attain the highest fitness. Evidence for the operation of such a mechanism is rare in this context, however. Here, I report an experiment that used oil-seed rape (Brassica napus cv. Westar) as the basis of a model system in which the spatial disposition of flowers' sexual organs was manipulated in order to characterize the relationship between form and function. Specifically, individual flowers were manipulated by replacing a section of the style with a length of fine wire in order to produce flowers with pistils of various lengths. The pollination performance of these virgin, model flowers was then assessed by measuring the amount of pollen removed and deposited during a single bumblebee visit. There was no evidence that pollen removal was affected by pistil length. Variation in pistil length, however, was associated with a pronounced optimum in pollen deposition, which was attained by only a narrow range of pistil variants of intermediate length. These results suggest that stabilizing selection may maintain the architectural invariability of animal-pollinated flowers.

AB Phenotypic plasticity has important ecological consequences because the strengths of species interactions can change with the behavior and morphology of interacting individuals. Evolutionary studies of plasticity can predict conditions under which shifts in phenotypes will occur and, therefore, may modify species interactions. We studied evolutionary mechanisms maintaining an induced response to predators in Triturus newt larvae, which are among many taxa in freshwater habitats exhibiting predator-induced plasticity. When exposed to caged (nonlethal) Aeshna dragonfly larvae, newts of two species (T. alpestris and T. helveticus) spent more time hiding in the leaf litter, had darker pigmentation in the tail fin, and developed larger heads and larger tails relative to their body size, in comparison with newts in predator-free ponds. The two phenotypes faced a performance trade-off across environments with and without odonates: the predator-induced phenotype survived twice as well as the no-predator phenotype when exposed to free dragonflies, but the predator-induced phenotype of both species grew more slowly until just before metamorphosis. For Triturus alpestris, a direct comparison of performance between phenotypes was;complicated because predator-induced newts emerged later in the summer but at a larger body size. Nonrandom mortality imposed by hunting dragonflies caused selection favoring increasing tail size, but we found no selection on specific traits in predator-free ponds. Head shape was not subject to selection in either environment; we suspect that head shape is involved in consuming different prey in the presence and absence of predators and is unrelated to predator escape. Triturus in 25 natural populations from which we collected quantitative samples in 1997 and 1998 exhibited extreme spatial variation in predation regime (density of large predators ranged from 0 to 24 individuals/m(2)). Variation among populations in head shape was exactly as predicted by experimental results (Triturus of both species had relatively large heads when exposed to predators), but results for tail shape were consistent with the experiments in only one of the two years. The evolutionary mechanisms maintaining plasticity in Triturus and other amphibian larvae should apply to many organisms inhabiting freshwater ponds, so trait-mediated indirect effects seem especially likely to occur in these habitats.

AB We investigated the spatial synchrony of outbreaks of the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, over much of its outbreak range in eastern North America during the period 1945-1988. Spatial synchrony decreased with distance between local populations and approached zero near 2000 km. Investigation of the synchrony of local population time series with cluster analysis revealed a pattern of geographically distinct blocks of clusters oriented along an east-west axis. Spatial synchrony also was identified in monthly temperature and precipitation time series at 18 weather stations over the same time period and geographical range as the spruce budworm outbreaks. Cross correlations decreased linearly with distance between stations and approached zero near 3000 km and 1800 km, respectively. We developed a spatially explicit lattice model for a single species occupying multiple patches. Within patches, the model had first order logistic dynamics, and patches were linked by dispersal that depended upon their separation distances. Both local and regional stochasticity (i.e., a Moran effect) were present. The modeled lattice had the same spatial configuration as the outbreak region to facilitate investigating the relative effects of a Moran effect and dispersal on spatial synchrony. Simulations with and without a simple region-wide Moran effect and three levels of dispersal did not produce the decrease in spatial synchrony with distance observed with spruce budworm time series. However, when run at the highest dispersal rate, those simulations produced cluster maps similar to that observed for spruce budworm defoliation. Simulations with a spatially autocorrelated disturbance that had either zero or high local variability and three levels of dispersal produced decreases in spatial synchrony with distance similar to that observed in the historical data. When run at the highest dispersal rate, simulations yielded cluster maps similar to the cluster map for defoliation. We discuss the potential significance of the spatially autocorrelated disturbance factor in understanding regional insect outbreaks. We also consider the plausibility of dispersal rates used in our simulations. We suggest in conclusion that spruce budworm outbreaks were synchronized by a combination of a spatially autocorrelated Moran effect and a high dispersal rate.

AB We studied between-year dispersal of adult females within a population of cooperatively breeding Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) in the Sandhills of North Carolina, using data collected between 1980 and 1995. We tested four hypotheses about the cause of breeding dispersal: inbreeding avoidance, mate choice, site choice, and social constraints. In addition, we assessed relationships among age, reproductive failure, and breeding dispersal, and we estimated cost of breeding dispersal by plotting mortality against dispersal rate as a function of circumstance.
   Breeding dispersal in the population that we studied is associated with multiple factors. Inbreeding avoidance influences dispersal of females whose sons inherit their natal territories. Mate choice influences dispersal of females whose mates have died; these females acquire older, higher quality mates by dispersing. In this study, there was no clear relationship between site choice and breeding dispersal. Social constraints do not appear to affect breeding dispersal in this population: no evidence was found to suggest that dispersal is associated with female-female competition, within-group competition for resources, or reproductive competition between mothers and helper sons.
   The effect of reproductive failure on breeding dispersal changes with female age. Reproductive failure is associated with breeding dispersal in young females only (those <3 yr old). Estimated mortality rates for breeding females that attempt to disperse vs. those that do not attempt to disperse were 59% and 26%, respectively; the difference between those rates is the estimated cost of breeding dispersal in this population, an additional 33% probability of mortality. Thus, breeding females more than double their risk of mortality by dispersing.

AB The effects of nectar robbers on plants and their mutualistic pollinators are poorly understood due, in part, to the paucity of studies examining male reproductive success in nectar-robbed plants. Here we measured the effects of a nectar-robbing bumblebee, Bombus occidentalis, on realized male reproductive success (seeds sired) in a hummingbird-pollinated plant, Ipomopsis aggregata. To determine the effects of nectar robbing on paternity, we used a series of experimental populations of plants containing a known allozyme marker. In each population, we experimentally controlled the levels of nectar robbing on each I. aggregata plant by cutting a hole in the corolla with dissecting scissors and removing nectar with a micro-capillary tube. We measured hummingbird-pollinator foraging behavior and fruit and seed production (maternal function) for each plant. We then genotyped seeds for the allozyme marker to determine the number of seeds sired by plants with known levels of robbing. Heavy nectar robbing (>80% of flowers robbed) significantly reduced the number of seeds sired, as well as the number of seeds produced due to pollinator avoidance of heavily robbed plants. Total plant reproduction, both male and female contributions, were reduced by 50% due to high levels of robbing. To date, no other studies have measured the effects of nectar robbing on realized male function (number of seeds sired). Ours is the first study to demonstrate that robbing can simultaneously decrease realized male reproductive success as well as female reproductive success, and that the effects are incurred indirectly through pollinator avoidance of robbed plants.

AB The degree of synchrony between populations is critical for their dynamics at large spatial scales. Population synchrony has been assessed for only a few species of vertebrates, most of them have largely fluctuating populations with multiannual cycles. We investigated the intensity and spatial extent of synchrony among populations of birds in Britain. The data analyzed ran from 1962 to 1995 at more than 100 local sites and concerned 60 species. For each species, we measured the intensity of synchrony among local populations using the cross-correlation function (CCF) and assessed its spatial extent. We tested for differences in these two measures with respect to habitat. We also assessed the potential influence of long-term trends in population synchrony. By aggregating the sites in regions and estimating an index for each region, we measured synchrony at a large spatial scale.
   In general, we found that synchrony was low between populations of British birds. All but one species with the strongest level of synchrony show a pronounced long-term decline. The mean CCF was significantly correlated with the mean abundance of each species in the Common Birds Census (CBC) sites, suggesting that the more abundant species have more synchronous populations. Significant differences in synchrony between habitats were found in 25 species; synchrony was stronger in farmlands compared to woodlands for 22 species. The same result was observed both at the intra- and interspecific levels. This may be the result of national change in agricultural practice affecting all farmland populations. Our cross-scale analysis showed that synchrony is a scale-dependent phenomenon.
   Our study is the first to focus on a large number of "noncyclic" species, and it suggests that synchrony is weaker for these species than for those with widely fluctuating cyclic populations. This is in agreement with some studies on synchrony of insects. Synchrony in natural populations seems to be determined by complex interactions between abundance, population variability, species characteristics, and demographic mechanisms. A general pattern emerging from our study and others is that population synchrony is more intense during declines.

AB Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus) on two adjacent submassifs, and Red Grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) on lower ground between them, shouted largely synchronous similar to 10-yr cycles during a similar to 50-yr study on the infertile Cairngorms massif of Scotland. Adult birds of both these Lagopus species were counted along transect walks. Both species showed the very low mid-1940s trough previously recorded for tetraonids in much of northwest Europe. Each of five subsequent peaks in all three populations fell within a year of one another, and 1-2 yr after cyclic high June temperatures at a nearby village. Troughs were less synchronous. A model with lagged June temperatures and fourth-order delayed density dependence, with no input from observed bird numbers after the first 4 yr, gave a good postdiction of Rock Ptarmigan numbers on the bigger submassif for 49 yr, suggesting a weather cycle entraining a Rock Ptarmigan cycle. However, June temperatures had little explanatory value for Rock Ptarmigan numbers on the smaller submassif. Indirect evidence suggested that synchrony between the two Rock Ptarmigan trajectories may have been due partly to emigration from the bigger to the smaller submassif. The population trajectory of Red Grouse resembled that of Rock Ptarmigan on the smaller submassif more closely than the two Rock Ptarmigan trajectories resembled one other. Hence synchrony depended more on local circumstances than on species.

AB The self-thinning rule describes a density-dependent upper boundary of stand biomass for even-aged pure plant stands in a given environment. The econometric approach of stochastic frontier production functions is adopted to estimate the self-thinning boundary line as a density-dependent stochastic biomass frontier using data from even-aged Pinus radiata stands. This method uses all the data points, but recognizes the differences in site occupancy among them. Since no subjective data selection is involved and no information contained in the data is lost, the line can be estimated without subjectivity and more efficiently than the common methods of subjective data selection. As a result, statistical inferences about the estimated self-thinning boundary line can be made objectively and more precisely. In addition, the estimates of site occupancy provide further insight into the dynamics of self-thinning stands.

AB We used mark-recapture methods to estimate the number of Parnssius smintheus (Papilionidae) butterflies moving among 20 alpine meadows separated by varying amounts of forest along the east slope of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, Canada. We combined generalized additive models and generalized linear models to estimate the effects of intervening habitat type and of population size on butterfly movement. By incorporating habitat-specific distances between patches, we were better able to estimate movement compared to a strictly isolation-by-distance model. Our analysis estimated that butterflies move readily through open meadow but that forests are twice as resistant to butterfly movement. Butterflies also tended to stay at sites with high numbers of butterflies, but readily emigrate from sites with small populations. We showed that P. smintheus are highly restricted in their movement at even a fine spatial scale, a pattern reflected in concurrent studies of population genetic structure. As an example of the utility of our approach, we used these statistical models, in combination with aerial photographs of the same area taken in 1952, to estimate the degree to which landscape change over a 43-year interval has reduced movement of butterflies among subpopulations. At these sites, alpine meadow habitat has declined in area by 78%, whereas the estimated effect of fragmentation has been to reduce butterfly movement by 41%.

AB We examine the influence of biological interactions and interannual variation in climate an the size structure and trophic interactions between age-0 largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and age-0 creek chubs (Semotilus atromaculatus) along a lake-stream gradient in northern Minnesota, USA. Considerable year-to-year variation in temperature and precipitation occurred during the 10-yr study (1983-1992), with most extreme hut-dry conditions in 1988 during a 3-yr drought. Decreased stream temperature and reduced variation in temperature: occurred downstream from the lake outlet because of increased groundwater inputs. Age-0 bass were captured in the stream in each of the eight years sampled, but bass abundance peaked in downstream reaches in 1988, concurrent with a large increase in the downstream density of age-0 chubs. Median length ratio of bass to chubs increased greatly in the 1988 drought year. The shift in relative length of bass and chubs during the drought was because chub length decreased in downstream areas, and bass shifted from feeding an invertebrates to feeding on chubs in downstream but not in upstream reaches. Comparison of bass and chub growth in the presence and absence of interspecific competition for invertebrate resources in an experimental stream revealed higher growth rates for chubs than for bass and little interspecific competition. Experiments in the artificial stream indicated that the presence or absence of chubs susceptible to bass predation had only marginal effects on bass survival, but growth rates of bass were substantially higher if chubs susceptible to predation were present. Only when chubs were present was the growth of individual bass dependent strongly on size, and this led to rapid divergence in the size distribution of bass in chubs vs. no-chubs treatments. Our results indicate that hot-dry climatic conditions associated with drought have potentially strong effects on size-structured trophic interactions between age-0 fish along lake-stream gradients. Hot-dry climatic conditions alter the spatial distribution of lake fish along temperature gradients in the stream, the reproductive success and synchrony of lake and stream fish development, and the eventual growth of predatory lake species. The response of fish to climatic variation appears to be strongly influenced by their position in the "hydrologic landscape." The most dramatic fish response occurred in stream reaches influenced by groundwater.

AB We investigated nitrogen cycling in the oligohaline zone (the low-salinity region where river water first enters the estuary) of the Parker River estuary in northeastern Massachusetts. We introduced an isotopic tracer (N-15-NO3-) for 27 days in August 1996 to help determine how watershed-derived nitrogen moves through the upper estuary. The amount of tracer added was sufficient to enrich nitrate isotopically by similar to 100 parts per thousand in the vicinity of the addition but did not influence nitrate concentration appreciably. During typical summer low-flow conditions as occurred during the addition period, essentially all riverine nitrate (including the nitrate tracer) was rapidly removed from the water column by the planktonic diatom Actinocyclus normanii. Export of tracer down-estuary was low during the isotope addition period, in part because of low river discharge. Instead, must of the nitrogen originally assimilated by A. normanii was transferred to sediments in the oligohaline zone. Nitrogen demand by phytoplankton during summer exceeded riverine supply by an order of magnitude. The additional nitrogen came mainly from the regeneration of benthic nitrogen, although some may have come from groundwater. The whole-ecosystem isotope tracer approach applied here was a powerful means of investigating the fate of watershed-derived nitrogen in the upper estuary.

AB Linking the results of localized field experiments to generalities about the role of specific processes is essential in ecology. Comparative studies conducted at multiple locations enable the general importance of processes to be assessed. However, spatial or temporal variation in the strength of local ecological relationships frequently makes it difficult to draw general conclusions, as increasing the extent of a study is likely to increase the physical and biological heterogeneity. To unravel the influence of differences in wave climate on local ecological interactions among adult and juvenile sandflat bivalves, an experiment was conducted at three sites in each of three harbors in the North Island of New Zealand. The selected sites covered a range of wind-wave exposures but were all mid-intertidal sandflats with macrobenthic communities dominated by bivalves. Four treatments were used additions of 0, 15, 45, and 110 adults of the tellinid bivalve Macomona liliana. At each site a DOBIE wave gauge was used to provide time-series data on wave orbital speed at the seabed over the 35-d duration of the experiment. Significant experiment x location interactions indicated site-dependent variation in the strength and direction of treatment effects. However, multiple regression models based on site environmental characteristics were very successful in explaining differences between sites in the strength of experimental treatment effects (66-99% of the variance explained). We used the cube of the orbital wave velocity at the seabed (U-b(3)) as an index of energy dissipation by waves. Both the site average and maximum U-b(3) were important variables explaining location-dependent treatment effects. Average U-b(3) increased the strength of the negative effects of experimental additions of adult Macomona on juvenile bivalves, presumably by increasing the opportunity for juvenile bivalves to be resuspended by small waves and transported away from areas with high adult densities. Maximum U-b(3) decreased the strength of the experimental effects, probably by increasing the purely passive transport of juveniles with sediment bedload and thus obliterating patterns in the distribution of juvenile bivalves relative to adult Macomona. Hence, different aspects of the wave climate influenced adult-juvenile interactions in different ways. Ambient density of adult Macomona around the experimental sites was also an important factor. This multisite experiment confirmed the importance of local adult-juvenile interactions and suggested ways in which these interactions are influenced by local environmental characteristics. Where the influence of such broad-scale variables can be identified, linking broad-scale information to small-scale studies that identify mechanisms can increase the generality of ecological experiments.

AB This study examined relationships among forest landscape dynamics, environmental factors (climate and landforms), and disturbance history in forests dominated by Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), and Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis) in the Bull Run basin in northwestern Oregon and evaluated the findings in a broader geographic context. Three sets of analyses were conducted: mapping of historical windthrow disturbance patches in the 265-km(2) Bull Run basin over the past century and analysis of their relationships with meteorological conditions, landforms, and vegetation; comparison of forest structure and species composition as a function of mapped windthrow and wildfire disturbance history in 34 1-ha vegetation survey plots in Bull Run; and canonical correspondence analysis of environmental factors and forest overstory species composition in 1637 vegetation plots in the Mount Hood and Willamette National Forests. Nearly 10% of the Bull Run basin has been affected by windthrow since 1890, but only 2% was affected prior to the onset of forest harvest in 1958. Most of the mapped windthrow occurred in areas with 500- to 700-yr-old canopy dominants and no mapped disturbance by fire in the past 500 yr. Most mapped windthrow occurred during three events in 1931, 1973, and 1983 that were characterized by extreme high speed east winds from the Columbia River Gorge. Forest harvest modified the effects of climate, landforms, and vegetation on windthrow disturbance, reducing the importance of topographic exposure to east and northeast winds, and creating a strong influence of recent clearcut edges, which accounted for 80% of windthrow in the 1983 event. Shade-tolerant overstory species (western hemlock and Pacific silver fir) are abundant in present-day forest stands affected by windthrow as well as by fire in the past century. In the western Cascade Range, Douglas-fir and western hemlock decline and Pacific silver fir increases with elevation (summer moisture stress declines but temperature variability increases), but this transition occurs at lower elevations in the Bull Run, perhaps because of the interaction between regional climate processes and disturbance along the Columbia Gor re. Complex landscape dynamics result from these contingent interactions among climate, landform and stand conditions, and disturbance.

AB In western parts of its native range, the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus) is sympatric with one or both of two slightly larger congeners. In the eastern part of its range, these species are absent. The small Indian mongoose was introduced, about a century ago, to the West Indies, the Hawaiian islands, Mauritius, the Fijian islands, and Okinawa. All introductions except possibly that to Mauritius were from the region of Calcutta and Bangladesh, where it is sympatric with both congeners. No other mongoose is present on any of these islands. In each instance, the introduced population derived from a small propagule. We examined size variation in the maximum diameter of the upper canine tooth (the prey-killing organ) and skull length. In the eastern (allopatric) part of its native range, males of the small Indian mongoose are much larger in both traits than in the western (sympatric) regions, approaching the size of the smaller of its absent two congeners, Herpestes edwardsii. Females from the allopatric part of the range are also larger than those of the source region. The species is more sexually dimorphic in the region of allopatry. On all islands to which it has been introduced, in 100-200 generations the small Indian mongoose has increased in male size and in sexual dimorphism; changes in female size have been slight and inconsistent. In general, sizes of island individuals are approximately intermediate in size between those in the region of origin (where they are sympatric and small) and those in the region of allopatry. Sexual dimorphism is greatest for canine diameter. Thus, H. javanicus shows variation consistent with ecological release from competition with its congeners. There is no evidence on whether this variation is genetic, nor on what dietary items might be partitioned between species and between sexes. However, morphological variation is consistently smaller for both traits and both sexes on the islands of introduction than in any part of the native range, consistent with idea of a genetic bottleneck imposed by the small propagule size. Neither of the two congeneric mongooses shows morphological variation consistent with ecological release from competition with H. javanicus in the southern part of their ranges, where the latter species is absent.

AB In Hawaiian montane forests, we assessed whether the same nutrients limit decomposition and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) along a soil chronosequence where nutrients demonstrably and predictably limit ANPP. At three sites that vary in parent material age (300, 20000, and 4.1 x 10(6) yr), we used fertilization to assess whether nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P) limit decomposition. Reciprocal transplants using litter bags allowed us to distinguish limitation by externally supplied nutrients vs. limitation by nutrients within litter. Nutrient limitation of decomposition was not predictable from nutrient limitation of ANPP, in that elevated litter and soil N had only small, if any, effects on decomposition, even at the young site where N limits ANPP. At the oldest site where P limits ANPP, both elevated litter P and increased availability of soil N and P increased decomposition rates. Thus, nutrients may limit decomposition more strongly in low-P than in low-N ecosystems. Fertilization affected litter nutrient dynamics more strongly than it did decomposition, and we observed uptake of both N and P by decomposers that was not always accompanied by changes in decomposition rates. Such nutrient incorporation into decomposing litter may retain nutrients within ecosystems, even when nutrients do not limit decomposition rates.

AB We capitalized on the anthropogenic, large-scale "experiment" of deforestation in the temperate rain forests of the Olympic Peninsula, Washington Stare, USA, to test whether mammalian-community structure is significantly influenced by anthropogenic transformation of this landscape (principal macrohabitats include continuous, old-growth forest; old-growth corridors; old-growth fragments; second-growth forest; and clearcuts). Species richness of all non-volant mammals was lowest in second-growth forests, while richness of the eight forest-dependent species was lowest in clearcuts.
   Species composition of mammalian communities differed significantly among the five principal macrohabitats, as did environmental characteristics recorded at each survey site. These differences indicate that both natural and anthropogenic processes have resulted in the nonrandom assembly of mammalian communities in this transformed, temperate rain forest landscape. The effects of deforestation are significant, interpretable (based to a large degree on changes in local habitat), and persistent given that the structure of mammalian communities from mature second-growth forests (up to 80 yr post-harvest) have not converged on those from native, old-growth forests.

AB Although natal dispersal has received considerable attention from animal ecologists, the causes and consequences of breeding dispersal have remained largely unexplored. We used telemetry, direct observation, and long-term mark-recapture (9 yr) to study breeding dispersal in the North American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) at Kluane, Yukon, Canada. We recorded the postbreeding behavior (keep the territory, share it with juveniles, or bequeath it to juveniles) of mothers from 485 litters, and monitored the fates of eight cohorts of weaned juveniles (680 individuals). The proportion of mothers that bequeathed their territory to one of their offspring was roughly one-third of that keeping or sharing it. Breeding dispersal was a recurrent phenomenon that characterized a fraction of the population of reproductive females every year. Dispersing females did not improve the quality of their breeding environment. In contrast, by leaving their territory, mothers allowed some offspring to stay on the natal site, which increased juvenile survival. Breeding dispersal by female red squirrels was thus a form of parental investment. Dispersing females were older than others, had higher numbers of juveniles at weaning, and moved their breeding sites more frequently after reproducing when food availability was high. These patterns are consistent with the major predictions of parental investment theories. We detected no difference in survivorship or future reproduction between dispersing and resident mothers. Juvenile males dispersed more often than females, but not farther. The sex of offspring did not influence whether mothers dispersed or not. Although we showed that breeding dispersal can have major impacts on the dynamics of squirrel populations, the relative implications of natal and breeding dispersal for the genetic structure and demography of populations and the social evolution of species remain unknown.

AB Surprisingly little research has been done to partition the contribution of catastrophic disturbance from that of small-scale individualistic mortality events on riparian large woody debris (LWD) recruitment. This study compared the impact of both processes on recruitment through simulation of several catastrophic disturbances (a spruce beetle outbreak, a moderately intense fire, and a clearcut) and undisturbed (individualistic mortality only) old growth for a small headwater stream in the Intermountain West of the United States. All scenarios progressed through a two-stage process, with the Forest Vegetation Simulator growth and yield model controlling forest dynamics and a postprocessor (CWD, version 1.2) predicting riparian LWD recruitment. Projections indicate that individualistic only conditions delivered 2.5 m(3) LWD.100 m reach(-1).10-yr cycle(-1); while the spruce beetle-, fire-, and clearcut-affected stands averaged 2.9, 3.2, and 1.5 m3 LWD 100 m reach(-1).cycle(-1), respectively. Stands impacted by natural catastrophic disturbance significantly (P < 0.05) increased cumulative (300 yr) LWD recruitment over the individualistic-only scenario, whereas clear-cutting significantly decreased total delivery. In-stream LWD loads, relatively stable in undisturbed riparian zones, fluctuated sharply under catastrophic disturbance. Peak channel loads associated with natural perturbation occurred similar to 30 yr after the event while debris volumes under clear-cutting immediately declined. The postevent recruitment and in-stream LWD stocks of all disturbance scenarios eventually fell below undisturbed conditions, requiring decades to recover historical volumes. Catastrophic disturbances induced such steep oscillations in riparian LWD load that the systems experiencing frequent large scale perturbations never achieved a long-term steady state, as some have postulated. Because of the inflation in cumulative LWD delivery, it may prove advantageous to encourage (or imitate) some catastrophic disturbance in forests along streams noticeably depauperate of LWD.

AB In many cannibalistic populations, cannibals share resources with their victims, leading to a size-dependent mixture of cannibalistic and competitive interactions. We analyze the impacts of such interactions on the population dynamics of Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) by considering effects of intercohort competition, habitat heterogeneity, habitat selection, and energy gain made by cannibals. Over a six-year period, we measured mortality and recruitment patterns, individual growth, body condition, resource levels, diets, and habitat use as functions of density for an allopatric perch population in a low-productivity lake.
   During the course of the study, two major die-offs took place, selectively affecting larger cannibalistic individuals, followed by several years of successful recruitment of young fish. Habitat use of perch greater than or equal to 2 yr old was density dependent, and these fish used only the inshore region at tow densities. The appearance of young fish followed the die-offs of cannibalistic perch and their subsequent absence from the offshore area, both of which decreased cannibalism on pelagic recruits. Whereas die-offs of larger perch could not be related to competition with young-of-the-year (YOY) perch, evidence for a competitive impact of YOY perch on Age-1 perch was present due to substantial food overlap. A strong depression in pelagic zooplankton was observed during summer in years with strong recruitment, which resulted in reduced consumption of zooplankton, slow growth, and reduced body condition in Age-1 perch and suggested high mortality of Age-1 perch in autumn. Age-1 perch did not appear to profit substantially from cannibalism on YOY perch because of the short time period that they could efficiently prey on YOY perch. The few larger perch that survived the die-offs gained substantial energy from cannibalism in years with strong recruitments, which increased both growth rates and per capita fecundity.
   Size-dependent intercohort competition may have strong impacts on cannibal-victim interactions when victims share resources with cannibals. Furthermore, habitat heterogeneity, combined with habitat selection, may limit the extent to which cannibals have a stabilizing effect on population dynamics. Finally, the energy gained by cannibals may have important consequences on population dynamics as this energy is allocated into new recruits.

AB Environmental stress can increase phenotypic variation in populations by affecting developmental stability of individuals. While such increase in variation results from individual differences in ability to buffer stress, groups of individuals and different traits may have different sensitivity to stressful conditions. For example, the sex that is under stronger directional selection for faster growth may be more sensitive to stressful conditions during development. On an individual level, stress-induced variation in a trait may be related to the strength of stabilizing selection that acts on the trait. We experimentally examined sensitivity of mandibular development to stress in a free-living population of common shrews (Sorex cinereus), a short-lived insectivore mammal with very limited dispersal and nearly continuous foraging activity. We found a strong increase in asymmetry in shrews born under stressful conditions. Increased asymmetry was associated with lower physiological condition in both control and stressed populations, although the effect of asymmetry on fitness was more pronounced under stressful conditions. Males' developmental stability was more sensitive to stressful conditions than developmental stability of females, suggesting that their apparently faster and more variable growth is more sensitive to stress than is growth of females. Mandible traits differed in their sensitivity to environmental changes. Preliminary results suggest that this differential sensitivity is proportional to the degree of developmental and functional morphological integration among mandibular traits.

AB According to the polygyny threshold model, females are compensated for the cost of sharing a territory with other females by breeding in territories of higher quality than those of monogamously mated females. In the polygynous Great Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus), the variation in territory quality may be associated with nest site characteristics or food supply. In this study, we examined the probability of nest predation in Great Reed Warblers in relation to an indirect measure of territory quality (territory attractiveness rank as indexed by settlement order) and to several variables of nest site structure. Artificial nests with attached soft plasticine model eggs were placed in Great Reed Warbler territories of different attractiveness; Marks in the soft model eggs were compared to marks from possible predator species. Both inter- and intraspecific predators were found to prey upon eggs in artificial nests. Marsh Harriers (Circus aeruginosus) predominantly preyed upon artificial nests located in territories of low attractiveness, in low-density reed beds, and early in the season. Bitterns (Botaurus stellaris) and Water Rails (Rallus aquaticus) showed a preference for artificial nests located inside the reeds. When all types of predators of artificial nests were pooled, the probability of nest predation was lower in more attractive territories. This pattern was corroborated in an analysis of predation on real nests. In general, polygyny occurred in territories with a low rate of nest predation, whereas unmated males held territories where the risk of predation was high. The low rate of nest predation in attractive territories on average compensated secondary females for the cost associated with sharing a male (i.e., reduced male assistance when feeding nestlings). The polygyny threshold model has been around for several decades, however, only few studies have identified the factors that may compensate secondary females for the cost of sharing a mate. In the present study we were able to show that the patterns of nest predation can be an important territory quality parameter that compensate secondary females, and, hence, contribute to the occurrence of avian polygyny.

AB Species are disappearing at unprecedented rates because of habitat destruction. Lack of detailed knowledge about total numbers of species and their global or regional distributions, however, makes it difficult to quantify extinction rates precisely. Current estimates of extinction rates attributed to habitat destruction generally rely on species-area relationships. Many of the predictions based on species-area relationships, however, appear to overestimate the extent of current species extinction. In a previous paper, we used the species-area relationship as our starting point to derive a relationship for the areal distribution of endemics within a habitat, or an "endemics-area relationship." The endemics-area relationship is logically and mathematically consistent with the species-area relationship, but it provides additional information about the distribution of species within a biome. In this paper, we use the endemics-area relationship to improve estimates of species ex tinction rates attributed to habitat destruction or conversion. At low levels of habitat destruction, estimates of species loss using the endemics-area relationship are significantly lower than existing estimates, but a rapid rise in predicted species loss when a threshold of habitat loss is exceeded suggests that extrapolation of recent rates of species loss may underestimate future species extinctions under continued land clearing.

AB The maximal running speeds of lizards have commonly been measured using level racetracks in a laboratory, but the normal speeds of locomotion of lizards and most animals in their natural habitats are not well documented. Thus we quantified the locomotor activity of the lizard Uma scoparia in its natural sand-dune habitat to determine how commonly animals run near their maximal speed and how inclines in the environment might affect habitat use and the speed of locomotion. We used leaf blowers to erase footprints in the sand in three 40 m x 100 m plots differing in surface topography and vegetation and then measured attributes of the paths and tracks left by U. scoparia that were not disturbed (by observers) during their period of peak activity. Laboratory observations allowed us to estimate speed for each field measurement of stride length (n = 5993). The frequency distribution of stride speed had two distinct modes (mean values 0.25 and 2.00 m/s), for which only the lower one is likely to be aerobically sustainable. Bipedal locomotion was extremely rare (<0.5% of all strides), but much undisturbed locomotion was unexpectedly fast. The inclines of the surfaces upon which locomotion occurred conformed to random habitat use. In contrast, the inclines of paths made by lizards had lower than expected amounts of nearly horizontal locomotion and a propensity for traveling almost directly uphill, especially when surfaces were steep. Habitat structure varied significantly among plots and affected several aspects of locomotion. For example, path length, average speed per path, and average magnitudes of path and surface inclines per path varied significantly among the three plots. Multiple regression analysis also revealed that the average speed per 1-m interval was maximized for paths with relatively shallow downhill slopes (-6% grade) and decreased significantly both with increased amounts of vegetative cover and increased turning between successive intervals. Unexpectedly, during undisturbed and escape locomotion, lizards used inclines similarly.

AB Populations of the freshwater crustacean Daphnia were grown in laboratory microcosms for nearly 2 yr, to assess periodicity and other features of population dynamics. Two experimental manipulations were imposed: the addition of other crustacean species and imposition of externally forced temperature variations. Linear time series analysis revealed cyclic dynamics, with periods ranging from 41 to 182 d. Periodic behavior was qualitatively robust to both experimental manipulations. It occurred in populations of D. pulicaria in microcosms with and without additional species of crustaceans, and it occurred in populations of D. magna with and without externally imposed oscillations in temperature. Periodicity was observed both in populations that persisted and in those that went extinct during the experiment. The experimental treatment of additional crustacean species, and perhaps that of temperature forcing, reduced the period of oscillation. For the longest time series, nonlinear autoregression techniques gave negative Lyapunov exponents, consistent with stable but noisy periodic dynamics rather than chaotic dynamics. Periodic models with a single fundamental frequency typically did not capture all the periodic behavior, however, suggesting that additional frequencies or responses to demographic stochasticity were present.

AB Nectar robbers are birds, insects, or other flower visitors that remove nectar from flowers through a hole pierced or bitten in the corolla. This paper is a review of the effects of nectar robbers on pollinators, pollination, and fitness of the plants they rob. Charles Darwin assumed that nectar robbers had a negative impact on the plants that they visit, but research done in the last 50 years indicates that they often have a beneficial or neutral effect. Several studies document that robbers frequently pollinate the plants that they visit. Robbers may also have an indirect effect on the behavior of the legitimate pollinators, and in some circumstances, the change in pollinator behavior could result in improved fitness through increased pollen how and outcrossing. The effects of nectar robbers are complex and depend, in part, on the identity of the robber, the identity of the legitimate pollinator, how much nectar the robbers remove, and the variety of floral resources available in the environment.

AB Because reducing aboveground competition for photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) increases growth and survival rates of tropical rain forest seedlings, belowground competition for nutrients is often assumed to be of little or no importance. We tested this assumption. We measured the growth, over one year, of seedlings of Aspidosperma carapanauba (shade tolerator) and Dinizia excelsa (light demander) transplanted into understory (high aboveground competition; 1% incoming photosynthetic photon flux density [PPFD]) and single treefall gap areas (lower aboveground competition; 6% PPFD in centers of gaps) without and with trenches cut around plots (high and low belowground competition). Over the wetter six months, location in gaps significantly increased relative height growth rates by 320% and 570%, and relative leaf production rates by 190% and 280%, while trenching significantly increased height by 330% and 520%, and leaf production by 170% and 260%, for Aspidosperma and Dinizia, respectively, with significant interactions between treatments Trenching approximately doubled height growth in the understory. Leaf loss rates were unaffected by either treatment but were 3.7 times higher in Dinizia compared with Aspidosperma. Aspidosperma could persist in the understory, as leaf production and loss were balanced at 0.60% PPFD, whereas Dinizia could not, as it required 2.4% PPFD. Reducing either aboveground competition or belowground competition allowed Dinizia to persist as leaf production was increased above unchanging leaf loss rates. Gap and trenching treatments both significantly reduced mortality rates in Dinizia. Location in gaps significantly reduced mortality rates in Aspidosperma. Both species significantly increased allocation to leaves and significantly decreased allocation to roots in response to trenching. The increased growth in the wet season caused by trenching, and increased foliar nitrogen and phosphorus amount, showed that both species were probably competing with adult trees for nutrients as well as PAR. We deduced that phosphorus did not limit growth; however, we could not deduce which nutrient did limit growth. Given that 60-70% of the world's tropical rain forests occur on low-fertility oxisols, intense adult-juvenile competition both aboveground and belowground may be the norm, not the exception.

AB The role of plant defensive compounds has often been studied within the purview of consumer diet choice. However, consumers are often confronted with foods distributed within depletable patches. To investigate the complication of resource depletion, I merged a consumer-resource model of nutritonal relationships between foods with the technique of giving-up densities for measuring foraging behavior in depletable food patches. Theory predicts that foods containing plant defenses that act as digestibility reducers (e.g., lignins and tannins) will be relatively less depleted under higher predation risk than will foods without defenses. In contrast, foods containing defensive toxins (e.g., alkaloids) that affect fitness directly, and not through diminished physiological uptake of energy, will be depleted without bias to predation risk or other foraging costs. I tested the theory using fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) feeding on sunflower seeds that were impregnated with either tannic or oxalic acid. Squirrels had their highest giving-up densities on oxalate-treated seeds and their lowest on water-treated (control) seeds. GUDs were also higher when patches were placed in riskier microhabitats. Moreover risky microhabitats increased tannin GUDs relative to control GUDs but had no effect on oxalate GUDs. The former observation is consistent with defenses that act as digestibility reducers, and the latter is consistent with defensive toxins. These results indicate that the effects of plant defensive compounds on foraging behavior are complicated and require consideration of not only the potential effects of the compound, but also the environment to which the forager is exposed. Tannins influence squirrel foraging behavior, but the effects may not be seen or realized unless the forager is in a sufficiently risky environment.

AB Recently Don Ludwig has shown that calculations of extinction probabilities based on currently available data are often meaningless due to the large uncertainty accompanying the estimates. Here we address two questions posed by his findings. Can one ever calculate extinction probabilities accurately? If so, how much data would be necessary? Our analysis indicates that reliable predictions of long-term extinction probabilities are likely to require unattainable amounts of data. Analytic calculations based on diffusion approximations indicate that reliable predictions of extinction probabilities can be made only for short-term time horizons (10% to 20% as long as the period over which the population has been monitored). Simulation results for unstructured and structured populations (three stage classes) agree with these calculations.

AB Hurricanes can strip leaves from plants and provide other stresses that can reduce resource availability for subsequent reproduction. In addition, hurricanes commonly reduce populations of bird pollinators. I measured both resource and pollination limitation of fruit set for Bahama Swamp-bush (Pavonia bahamensis) on San Salvador Island in the Bahamas before and after two seasons of hurricanes.
   Before the hurricanes in the winter flowering season in 1994-1995, fruit set of P. bahamensis was 100% for most shrubs. After a mild hurricane, in 1995-1996, fruit set was 48%. After the severe Hurricane Lili (Category 2) in 1996-1997, mean fruit set was only 11%. In both years after the hurricanes, lower fruit set reflected resource limitation. In 1996-1997 after Hurricane Lili, fruit set was severely reduced an additional 74% by pollination limitation.
   Pollination limitation was caused by declines of the two bird pollinators, Bananaquits and Bahama Woodstars. In 1994-1995, both species were frequent visitors to flowers, but in 1996-1997 these birds were rarely seen on the island. A concurrent mist-netting study indicated that Bananaquit populations were decimated after Hurricane Lili in 1996. Nectar removal was virtually absent, and pollen deposition on stigmas was low. In 1994-1995, 98% of the stigmas had received pollen by the end of floral life. In contrast, in 1996-1997, 51% of the flowers had received no pollen, supporting the conclusion that pollination limitation of fruit set was strong. There was no compensatory pollination by other pollinators, either other bird species or insects.
   These results indicate that severe hurricanes can affect fruit set directly through resource limitation and indirectly through reducing bird pollinators and causing pollination limitation of fruit set. Reduced fruit set after a hurricane could be especially disadvantageous because hurricanes can create sites for plant recruitment. Although resource limitation of fruit set may affect many plant species, bird-pollinated species may be faced with a double jeopardy of resource limitation of fruit set and pollination limitation of fruit set. Whether this disadvantage affects the recruitment of bird-pollinated plants after hurricanes or their adaptations for recruiting after hurricanes remains to be examined.

AB We tested the hypothesis that soil microbial diversity affects ecosystem function by evaluating the effect of denitrifier community composition on nitrous oxide (N(2)O) production. Denitrification is a major source of atmospheric N(2)O, an important greenhouse gas and a natural catalyst of stratospheric ozone decay. The major environmental controls on denitrification rate and the mole ratio of N(2)O produced during denitrification have been incorporated into mechanistic models, but these models are, in general, poor predictors of, in situ N(2)O flux rates. We sampled two geomorphically similar soils from fields in southwest Michigan that differed in plant community composition and disturbance regime: a conventionally tilled agricultural field and a never-tilled successional field. We tested whether denitrifier community composition influences denitrification rate and the relative rate of N(2)O production [Delta N(2)O/Delta(N(2)O + N(2))], or rN(2)O, using a soil enzyme assay designed to evaluate the effect of oxygen concentration and pH on the activity of denitrification enzymes responsible for the production and consumption of N(2)O. By controlling, or providing in nonlimiting amounts, all known environmental regulators of denitrifier N(2)O production and consumption, we created conditions in which the only variable contributing to differences in denitrification rate and rN(2)O in the two soils was denitrifier community composition. We found that both denitrification rate and rN(2)O differed for the two soils under controlled incubation conditions. Oxygen inhibited the activity of enzymes involved in N(2)O production (nitrate reductase, Nar; nitrite reductase, Nir; and nitric oxide reductase, Nor) to a greater extent in the denitrifying community from the agricultural field than in the community from the successional field. The Nar, Nir, and Nor enzymes of the denitrifying community from the successional field, on the other hand, were more sensitive to pH than were those in the denitrifying community from the agricultural field. Moreover, the denitrifying community in the soil from the successional field had relatively more active nitrous oxide reductase (Nos) enzymes, which reduce N(2)O to N(2), than the denitrifying community in the agricultural field. Also, the shape of the rN(2)O curve with increasing oxygen was different for each denitrifying community. Each of these differences suggests that the denitrifying communities in these two soils art: different and that they do not respond to environmental regulators in the same manner. We thus conclude that native microbial community composition regulates an important ecosystem function in these soils.

AB Population stability ultimately depends on the life-history characteristics of individuals; thus, it may be indirectly affected by natural selection acting on various life-history traits. This study investigates the efficacy of natural selection in molding the stability of populations living at an unstable equilibrium. The stability of laboratory populations of Drosophila is affected by the relative amount of food given to larvae and adults. Environments with high larval food levels and low adult food levels (HL environments) tend to have asymptotically stable carrying capacities. Environments with low larval food levels and high adult; food levels (LH environments) tend to exhibit unstable dynamics, like population cycles. In this experiment, 20 populations were created from two different types of source populations. Five of the source populations had evolved for 71 generations under crowded larval conditions and uncrowded adult conditions (CU populations), while the other five source populations had evolved for a comparable time in uncrowded larval and uncrowded adult conditions (UU). In this study, five replicate CU and UU populations each were placed in both the I-IL and LH environments, and total adult population counts and adult biomass were recorded for 45 generations. Every five generations, we also estimated the density-dependent fecundity function in each population, since population stability depends critically on the shape of this function. While we could document phenotypic evolution in these populations for several characters due to density-dependent natural selection, there was no detectable change in the population stability characteristics of the unstable LH populations. This result is consistent with either no evolution of population stability, or very slow change. Thus, while evolution in these populations affects important life-history characteristics, these changes appear to have no detectable effects on population stability.

AB The widespread occurrence of dispersal polymorphisms among insects is consistent with the hypothesis that fitness costs are associated with flight capability. Although trade-offs between flight capability and reproduction are well documented in the females of many wing-polymorphic insect species, the relationship between dispersal capability and reproductive success in males is poorly established. Here we examine the potential cost of flight capability in males of the salt-marsh-inhabiting planthopper Prokelisia dolus (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). This species exhibits a dispersal polymorphism with both flightless adults (brachypters) and migratory adults (macropters) occurring in populations.
   In a competitive setting in the laboratory, brachypterous males exhibited a threefold mating advantage over macropterous males; they obtained 77% of the matings with brachypterous females. This mating advantage resulted, in part, from brachypterous males aggressively displacing rival macropters during courtship. There was also a nonsignificant tendency for brachypterous males to arrive before macropterous males to court a calling female. Neither female rejection behavior nor male body size appeared to contribute to the mating advantage of brachypterous males. When macropterous females were contested, the mating advantage of the male wing forms changed and macropterous males obtained the majority of matings. Thus, there was evidence for assortative mating based on wing form.
   When placed with ten brachypterous females, brachypterous males sired twice as many offspring as did macropterous males. This advantage was due to brachypters siring more offspring per female and not from inseminating more females; hence differences in sperm load between the male wing forms are implicated in the siring advantage of brachypters. There was, however, no tendency for brachypterous males to survive longer than their macropterous counterparts; thus, differences in longevity did not contribute to enhanced siring ability. Overall, these results provide support for a trade-off between dispersal capability and reproductive success in males.

AB Species richness can affect both the size and stability of populations. Many simple theories predict that complex speciose communities should be less stable than simple ones. In contrast, stability of collective community attributes, such as functional groups, may be greater in more complex communities. We used aquatic microcosms containing microbial food webs to generate an experimental gradient of species richness. Biweekly counts of population samples permitted estimation and comparison of density, persistence time, and temporal variation in density for populations and trophic functional groups embedded in communities of varying richness. Densities of nearly half of the species declined as species richness increased, demonstrating broad community-wide density compensation that resulted from more abundant competitors and predators in species-rich communities. Persistence time, a measure of population stability, also declined with increasing species richness. Another measure of population stability, temporal variation in density, indicated that abundances of most species embedded in diverse communities varied no more than in less diverse communities. In contrast to results for individual species, temporal variation of entire functional groups composed of multiple species decreased as species richness increased. The stability of individual populations was not predicted by that of functional groups. Interspecific interactions and statistical averaging may both contribute to the reduced temporal variability of functional groups created by aggregating multiple species.

AB Few studies have attempted to determine experimentally the relative importance of direct and indirect effects of host plants on herbivorous insects in the field. This study identifies important direct and indirect effects of a coastal plant on its most common insect herbivore and assesses the relative importance of those effects. The direct effects of increased interstitial soil salinity and nitrogen on the abundance of Pissonotus quadripustulatus (Homoptera: Delphacidae), which feeds on Borrichia frutescens (Asteraceae), are reported. Also reported are the indirect effects of these treatments on parasitism of P. quadripustulatus eggs laid in plant stems by the fairyfly parasitoid Anagrus sp. nr. armatus (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae). Soil salinity was experimentally elevated by the addition of salt pellets, and plant foliar nitrogen was increased by the addition of fertilizer.
   Both salt and fertilizer increased the abundance of P. quadripustulatus. There was a significant salt X fertilizer interaction, suggesting that salt stress may be more important when plants are more nitrogen limited. Salt, by increasing the frequency of tough B. frutescens stems, decreased the rate at which Anagrus parasitized P. quadripustulatus eggs. Fertilizer, by increasing the frequency of B. frutescens stems that were softer and easier to penetrate, increased the rate of parasitism. Changes in parasitism, however, did not affect P. quadripusrtuatus density. Tests for density dependence showed that the results reported here were attributable to application of the treatments and not to spatial density dependence. This study suggests that, in a stressful salt-marsh system, the direct effects of plant quality on herbivores are more important than indirect effects of plant morphology mediated by natural enemies.

AB Occurrence of Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) pairs and broods was studied on 86 boreal lakes in two areas in south Finland during 1988-1997 (35 lakes) and 1989-1996 (51 lakes), and field experiments were conducted to determine whether food limitation is an important factor regulating population densities. In general, pairs and broods used and avoided the same lakes, but in both study areas, the proportion of lakes that were unoccupied every year was higher for broods (71% and 69%) than for pairs (26% and 31%). We hypothesized that lakes without breeding Mallards, and especially broods, were too poor to raise young in, and we tested that in field experiments on 22 lakes in boreal Sweden. Based on concentration of total phosphorus in the water, these lakes were divided into two groups: 11 "poor" lakes and 11 "rich" lakes. Mallard ducklings imprinted on humans were used to address brood-stage food limitation by studying mass change. Thirty-one individually marked ducklings were divided into three experimental groups: 12 ducklings were used in poor lakes, 12 ducklings in rich lakes, and 7 ducklings were used as controls receiving no experimental treatment in the field. Each group was studied in 11 daytime trials on 11 different lakes, except the control group which was kept in a pen with free access to food. Ducklings of all groups spent nights together as a big 31-individual group in the same pen and with free access to food. Ducklings foraging on poor lakes gained significantly less body mass than those feeding on rich lakes. At night, when ducklings of both groups had equal and free access to food, ducklings that had been feeding in a poor lake that day gained more mass than those that had been feeding in a rich lake. Overall, similar to 95% of daily mass gain was accounted for by daytime gain in the control group, the corresponding percentage was 35% in the rich-lake experimental group and 11% in the poor-lake experimental group. Thus, we have observational, as well as experimental, evidence to conclude that many boreal lakes are inferior breeding habitat for Mallards, especially during the brood stage. Our results suggest (1) that it is important to recognize at what stage of the yearly reproductive cycle food limitation may occur, (2) that brood stage may be more important than nesting stage for possible population limitation and regulation in breeding Mallards, and (3) that the reason why so many lakes in the boreal region lack breeding Mallards may be food limitation.

AB In groundwater ecosystems, in situ primary production is low, and metabolism depends on organic matter inputs from other regions of the catchment. Heterotrophic metabolism and biogeochemistry in the floodplain groundwater of a headwater catchment (Rio Calaveras, New Mexico, USA) were examined to address the following questions: (1) How do groundwater metabolism and biogeochemistry vary spatially and temporally? (2) What factors influence groundwater metabolism? (3) What is the energy source for groundwater metabolism?
   At Rio Calaveras, surface discharge and water table elevation increased at the onset of spring snowmelt. Groundwater biogeochemical changes in response to snowmelt included increases in dissolved oxygen and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Dissolved organic carbon concentration then decreased exponentially with time, suggesting that newly saturated floodplain sediments were a major source of DOG. Organic matter content in seasonally saturated sediments averaged 3% by mass, and similar to0.05 mg C/g dry sediment was water soluble. Microorganisms from these sediments were able to consume an average of 45% of the leached DOG. These results show that snowmelt imports DOC to groundwater and that a substantial amount can be consumed by biota. These results may be important ecologically if the growth and abundance of groundwater organisms are limited by DOC availability.
   The influence on groundwater heterotrophic metabolism of DOC availability, inorganic nitrogen (N), inorganic phosphorus (P), temperature, and season were assessed using laboratory manipulations of aquifer sediments and seasonal measurements in field microcosms. Augmentation with DOC (10 mgC/L above background) nearly doubled respiration rate during base flow but did not influence respiration during snowmelt. In contrast, addition of N and P did not influence respiration at any time. Respiration rate during snowmelt was significantly higher than at base flow and was not influenced by any combination of DOG, N, P, or temperature. The hypothesis that groundwater metabolism is limited by DOC availability during base flow was supported. Hydrologic linkage between soils and groundwater represents a critical flux of DOC that supports metabolism in unconfined alluvial aquifers.

AB Current paradigms relating to reptilian temperature regulation are derived almost entirely from data on diurnally active species, although many reptile species are nocturnal. We investigated the extent and behavioral mechanisms of temperature regulation in the nocturnal, rock-dwelling marbled gecko Christinus marmoratus during spring and summer During the daytime, we recorded body temperatures of lizards sheltering beneath rocks, as well as operative temperatures (the equilibrium body temperatures that animals would attain in given microclimates) beneath randomly chosen rocks available to the lizards. These measurements were compared with reference to the lizard's set-point (or target) temperature range (T-set), which we determined in a laboratory thermal gradient. In both seasons, Lizard body temperatures were closer to T-set than were randomly sampled operative temperatures, despite mean operative temperatures being 7 degreesC below and 6 degreesC above T-set in spring and summer, respectively. The mean body temperature of geckos was 7 degreesC higher, and the accuracy and effectiveness of temperature regulation were also much higher, during summer than during spring. The more severe physiological consequences of thermoconformity during summer, as well as a more constraining thermal environment during spring, are advanced as reasons for this seasonal pattern. At least two behavioral mechanisms allow C. marmoratus to achieve a regulated body temperature. First, operative temperatures within retreat sites selected by geckos were closer to T-set than were operative temperatures beneath available rocks, suggesting retreat-site selection as a thermoregulatory mechanism. Second, lizard body temperatures were closer to T-se than were operative temperatures at random positions within selected retreat sites. This observation, together with correlative evidence relating lizard body temperature to the maximum and minimum operative temperatures beneath selected retreat sites, indicates that positional and/or postural adjustments were also employed as thermoregulatory mechanisms. This study suggests that nocturnal lizards are capable of regulating body temperature to an extent that is comparable to that of diurnal lizards. Our findings have implications for understanding the thermal physiology and ecology of nocturnal ectotherms.

AB The leaf coral Agaricia humilis occurs mainly on the undersides of surfaces in shallow water, a distribution different from the vast majority of corals at our study site in Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles. A series of hypotheses were tested for specific mechanisms that could cause the observed distributions of Agaricia humilis. We found that a suite of larval swimming and settling behaviors, in large part, drives the adult distribution of the species. These behaviors include: (]) swimming behavior that causes larvae to position themselves in shallow water, (2) orientation behavior during settlement that causes larvae to preferentially settle on the undersides of surfaces, and (3) settlement behavior where chemosensory recognition of morphogenic molecules associated with the cell walls of specific crustose red algae is required for induction of settlement and metamorphosis. The consequences of atypical larval behavior are severe and include decreased survivorship, growth, and ability to reproduce sexually.

AB The role of potential infection by parasitic trematodes in the choice of oviposition site choice by gray treefrogs, Hyla versicolor, was examined in a randomized experiment using 25 experimental pools. Treatment pools containing low (five snails) or high (10 snails) densities of either infected or uninfected trematode vector Pseudosuccinea columella were compared with control pools containing no P. columella.
   Treatments had significant effects on the number of gray treefrog eggs deposited in pools. Compared to control pools, fewer eggs were laid in all treatment pools, either because fewer pairs laid eggs, or fewer eggs were laid per visit. Pools containing infected P. columella also had fewer eggs deposited relative to pools containing uninfected P. columella.
   The gray treefrog, H. versicolor, can discriminate between oviposition sites, based on the species present and the potential for infection. Choice of oviposition site can be a mechanism that determines the composition of ecological communities as well as influencing parental reproductive success. Our results emphasize the importance of disease agents in shaping patterns of distribution, and they underscore the importance of understanding how potential hosts may use behavior to mitigate infection risk.

AB Elasticities of lambda indicate the influence of demographic parameters on both individual fitness and population growth for a population with density-independent growth. Here we discuss the extension of elasticity analysis to populations with density-dependent demographic parameters and examine the circumstances in which the standard density-independent analysis gives useful information fur populations that are, in reality, density dependent. In the presence of density dependence the fitness of one strategy depends upon what the rest of the population is doing. Elasticities of fitness must therefore be calculated using invasibility methods, and the resulting elasticities of the invasion exponent l are not necessarily identical with elasticities of mean or equilibrium population size. The former are of interest in evolutionary studies; the latter in population management.
   If a population has a stable equilibrium and density dependence is a function of the total number of individuals in the population, then elasticities of fitness are equal to elasticities of lambda, and elasticities of equilibrium population size are proportional to these. Even at equilibrium, elasticities of population size are not necessarily proportional to elasticities of lambda when density dependence is a function of the number of individuals in only part of the population, as in populations regulated by competition between juveniles. Elasticities of lambda are also a relatively poor guide to elasticities of population size when population numbers fluctuate. Thus, if density dependence operates at any stage in the life history, ignoring it can result in elasticity analyses that are a misleading guide fur population management. In the presence of stochastic environmental variation, elasticities of lambda calculated for the observed mean projection matrix are often a quite accurate approximation to elasticities of fitness, even when population fluctuations: are large. An elasticity analysis on an observed mean projection matrix will often give useful information regarding selection pressures on individual demographic parameters, although this approximation usually per forms poorly for populations with nonequilibrium dynamics. Whether one is interested in life history evolution or population management, the amount of work involved in carrying out a density-dependent elasticity analysis is small, relative to the amount of work involved in quantifying demographic parameters in the field populations. It will therefore usually be worth carrying out some nonlinear analyses using plausible patterns of density dependence and environmental stochasticity to ensure that an appropriate elasticity analysis is used.

AB We explored the long-term (8-yr) effects of separate field manipulations of temperature and nutrient availability on carbon balance in wet sedge tundra near the Arctic Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site at Toolik Lake, Alaska. Our goals were (1) to assess the relative importance of chronic warming (with field greenhouses) and increased N and P availability (by fertilization) in controlling gross ecosystem photosynthesis, ecosystem respiration (plant plus heterotrophic respiration), and ultimately ecosystem C balance; and (2) to attempt to partition ecosystem responses to these treatments between plant and soil contributions. We present results of the effects of these manipulations on whole-system CO2 exchange over seasonal and diel cycles, and on nonrhizosphere soil microbial respiration using in situ soil incubations.
   Wet sedge control plots were, at best, a weak sink for carbon even during the peak growing season. Chronic nutrient additions of N + P shifted wet sedge carbon balance to a strong sink throughout the growing season; nutrient availability regulated seasonal and diel CO2 exchanges in these two wet sedge ecosystems. The N + P plots had significantly higher photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration in spite of the unanticipated effect of similar to 30% reduction in thaw depth in these plots, apparently due to a twofold increase in litter accumulation insulating the soil surface and/or possible shading from greater plant cover in these plots. These results highlighted the prevailing importance of nutrient-carbon interactions in controlling ecosystem processes and ecosystem C balance in arctic tundra.
   In contrast, warming had only subtle effects on CO2 exchanges. Increased temperatures in the warmed plots had little effect on instantaneous rates of photosynthesis or respiration. After eight years of chronic warming with an average 5.6 degrees C higher air temperature over the growing season and a 40-200% increase in net N mineralization rate, it was surprising that warming did not have more profound effects on CO2 exchange and plant cover. If there were an effect of warming, increased temperatures might cause early canopy development and lengthen the growing season, rather than directly affect instantaneous rates of photosynthesis, Based on photosynthesis-light response curves developed from the early- and late-season diel measurements, we demonstrated that the main effect of warming was to accelerate the development of the canopy early in the season. By midseason, however, there were no significant differences in C exchange between warmed and control plots.
   Perhaps the most important and novel result emerging from this study is the prevailing importance of plant C exchange, not soil processes, in driving ecosystem C fluxes. First, nonrhizosphere soil microbial respiration as estimated CO2 flux from in situ soil incubations was a small fraction of whole-system respiration and did not vary among treatments. This suggests that anaerobic conditions or some other factor may limit soil microbial respiration more than do temperature or nutrients. Second, plant respiration contributed most (90%) of the ecosystem respiration in fertilized plots. This unanticipated and large contribution from plant respiration highlights the critical importance of understanding the response of plant respiration to global environmental change in these wet sedge ecosystems.

AB Ecologists working with metapopulations are interested in the rate of migration among several local populations, mortality during migration, and the scaling of migration rate with habitat patch area and isolation. We describe a model of individual capture histories obtained from multisite mark-release-recapture studies, which allows one to measure these parameters using maximum likelihood estimation. The model yields separate estimates of mortality within habitat patches and mortality during migration, on the assumption that only the latter is affected by the isolation of the source population. The model is suitable for studies involving 10 or more populations, with differences in habitat patch areas and isolation, and in which several hundred individuals have been marked and recaptured. We apply the model to a metapopulation of the butterfly Melitaea diamina with 14 local populations, 557 marked individuals, and 1301 recaptures. Immigration and emigration scaled as patch area to power 0.2, Roughly half of the daily losses of individuals from habitat patches of 1 ha in area were due to emigration, <1% of daily migration distances were >1 km, and 16% of all deaths were estimated to have occurred during migration. Programs are available to calculate the parameter estimates, their confidence intervals, and goodness-of-fit tests.

AB Models of habitat associations for species often are developed with an implicit assumption that habitats are static, even though recent disturbance may have altered the landscape. We tested our hypothesis that trajectory and magnitude of habitat change influenced observed distribution and abundance of passerine birds breeding in shrubsteppe habitats of southwestern Idaho. Birds in this region live in dynamic landscapes undergoing predominantly large-scale, radical, and unidirectional habitat change because wildfires are converting shrublands into expanses of exotic annual grasslands. We used data from field surveys and satellite image analyses in a series of redundancy analyses to partition variances and to determine the relative contribution of habitat change and current landscapes. Although current habitats explained a greater proportion of total variation, changes in habitat and measures of habitat richness and texture also contributed to variation in abundance of Horned Larks (Eremophila alpestris), Brewer's Sparrows (Spizella breweri), and Sage Sparrows (Amphispiza belli). Abundance of birds was insensitive to scale for nonspatial habitat variables. In contrast, spatial measures of habitat richness and texture in the landscape were significant only at large spatial scales. Abundance of Horned Larks, Western Meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta), and Brewer's Sparrows, but not Sage Thrashers (Oreoscoptes montanus) or Sage Sparrows, was positively correlated with changes toward stable habitats. Because dominant habitat changes were toward less stable conditions, regional declines of those birds in shrubsteppe habitats reflect current landscapes as well as the history, magnitude, and trajectory of habitat change.

AB We used reciprocal transplant experiments to test the relative strengths of the effects of plant clone and environment on the density of insect herbivores both directly, via plant effects, and indirectly, via natural enemy effects. We performed reciprocal transplants of Spartina alterniflora, salt marsh cord grass, among three sites that differed in environmental characteristics, in densities of the herbivore Prokelisia marginata, and in attack rates of Prokelisia eggs by the parasitoid Anagrus sophiae. Herbivore density was significantly affected by both site of origin (plant clone) and recipient site (local environment). This may be because both plant clone and local environment affect plant quality or because they affect attack rates of herbivores by natural enemies. Our results show that in the Spartina-Prokelisia-Anagrus system, the effects of plants on herbivores vi a their natural enemies may be equivalent in strength to plant quality effects.

AB Most amphibian species with an aquatic larval stage use one of two types of breeding habitats: ephemeral or permanent water bodies: A common assumption is that, once a minimum developmental threshold has passed, tadpoles of species that use temporary ponds can respond adaptively to a drying larval habitat by hastening development to metamorphose before the pond dries. We investigated how different pond drying regimes affected the timing of metamorphosis and body size at metamorphosis of two closely related species of hylid treefrogs, one of which commonly breeds in temporary ponds (Hyla gratiosa) and the other in permanent ponds (Hyla cinerea). We experimentally manipulated the water level in cattle-tank communities, exposing tadpoles of each species to a slow drying treatment, a fast drying treatment, and a constant water level treatment. There was no direct effect of pond drying on the larval period or body size at metamorphosis of either species. The drying treatments indirectly affected these traits by increasing larval densities, which extended the larval period and produced smaller sizes at metamorphosis. The timing of metamorphosis and body size at metamorphosis of H. gratiosa were more plastic than the corresponding traits in H. cinerea, but this greater plasticity cannot be interpreted as adaptive. Our results emphasize the utility of the comparative approach in interpreting the potential adaptive responses of species to environmental variation.

AB We examined the correlation between seed size (mass) and spatial and temporal distribution and abundance of plants, using both published data from northern England and 18 years of census data from permanent quadrats in the Chihuahuan Desert, Arizona, USA. In both systems, there were many small-seeded species and few large-seeded ones. Spatial patterns of distribution and abundance were constrained by seed size within triangle envelopes, i.e., small-seeded species had a greater range of abundance and a greater number of sites occupied than did large-seeded species. Temporal patterns of abundance and distribution from the Chihuahuan Desert site were similarly correlated with seed size, i.e., small-seeded species were, in general more abundant and present in more than were large-seeded species. These patterns probably result because small-seeded species produce more seeds. are more vagile, and persist longer in seed banks than do large-seeded species. The results are consistent with recent findings from seed bank studies, suggesting the generality of the correlation between seed size and plant abundance and distribution.

AB Patterns of parasitism in insular avian communities can provide insight into processes that maintain host-parasite associations. On one hand, replicable relationships within evolutionarily independent communities of the same host and parasite taxa would indicate that these interactions are stable over time. On the other hand, unique ecological conditions on each island, sporadic colonizations and extinctions, plus new genetic variation would lead to island-specific host-parasite relationships. We examined the: distribution of three parasitic taxa among avian host species on three islands in the Lesser Antilles: St. Lucia, Martinique, and Dominica. Blood protozoa of the genus Haemoproteus were found in 34% of host individuals examined. A significant species effect, but no significant island effect, was observed, suggesting an ecologically stable and replicable host-parasite association. Cysts of the tissue-dwelling protozoan genus Sarcocystis were observed in 4% (9% on Dominica) of host individuals and were significantly associated with ground foraging. Epithelial lesions characteristic of avian papilloma virus were recorded in 4% of host individuals on Martinique only. The pattern of infection with papilloma virus or Sarcocystis (significant island effect) indicated that host species on a particular island are linked in transmission webs of these parasites. Such island-specific associations suggest a role for either history or unique local ecology in host-parasite associations.
   There was a statistically significant interaction between island and species effects in the prevalence of Haemoproteus. This may stem from the independent evolution of host-parasite interactions in the different island populations. We were able to assess the extent of genetic divergence of the host species by analysis of mitochondrial ATPase 6,8 sequences. There was little genetic divergence between island populations of the host species. Therefore, the variation in Haemoproteus prevalence is not likely to be related to genetic differentiation of the host populations.
   Birds infected with Haemoproteus exhibited elevated leukocyte levels indicative of immunological control of the parasite. After statistically controlling for the intensity of Haemoproteus infection and host species, leukocyte levels varied significantly among islands on which the host resided. This is consistent with the idea that insular avian communities are linked by transmission webs of parasites having broad host specificity.

AB Nitrogen cycling is generally considered to be more rapid on sites with high availability of N; this is usually associated with differences in tree species composition. We tested whether N cycling in stands of a single tree species increased with increasing mineral soil nitrogen capital. Rates of N cycling in nine stands of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) were estimated by measuring annual N input in litter, N content of the forest floor, and net N mineralization rate in the forest floor. Rates of C and N turnover were estimated from the litterfall:forest floor ratio. The amount of N returned in litter increased as soil N capital increased. The increase in litter N content resulted from both increased litter mass (C content) and increased N concentration in litter. Despite the greater litter input, forest floor mass was smaller at N-rich sites, indicating more rapid turnover of the forest door on N-rich sites. There was a positive relationship between fractional annual loss of N from the forest floor and soil N capital. Therefore, even without changes in tree species composition, sites with greater soil N capital returned mure N in annual litterfall and had faster turnover of N in the forest floor. Fractional annual loss of C also increased with increasing soil N capital, indicating faster decomposition on N-rich sites. The rate of net N mineralization during laboratory incubations of the forest floor was not correlated with soil N capital or N concentrations of litter, but was related to the C:N ratio of the forest floor. Net N mineralization was appreciable only at two sites where forest floor C:N ratios were <35. The rate of net N mineralization or C:N ratio of the forest floor were not good indicators of N availability at these sites. The results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that rates of N cycling are faster on N-rich sites, and that this effect can occur in the absence of changes in tree species composition.

AB Using a mark-recapture technique in a small temperate stream, we described the movement of four fish species over a five-month period and developed a mathematical model that described the observed movement patterns. The movement distributions were generally leptokurtic, and two of the four species demonstrated some degree of upstream bias. There was little difference in movement among species or through time. There were no temporal correlations in probability of movement, movement direction, or distance moved. The spatial spread of the most abundant species, bluehead chubs, over a four-month period was characterized by upstream bias, diffusion-like spread, and persistent leptokurtosis. Bluehead chubs demonstrated complex relationships between probability of movement and size and growth, while creek chubs showed only an effect of size on probability of movement. Further, growth of individual bluehead chubs was correlated through time. These empirical results suggest the hypothesis that heterogeneity in phenotypic attributes, such as size and growth, is related to heterogeneity in movement behavior.
   A diffusion-advection model of bluehead chub movement, structured with two subgroups that dispersed at different rates ("fast fish" and "slow fish"), was parameterized and validated with the field data. This model with heterogeneity in movement rates generated the leptokurtic pattern observed in the field data, in contrast to the classic diffusion model without population heterogeneity, which produces a normal distribution.
   The results from this work suggest that heterogeneity in fitness-influencing attributes such as size and growth could explain heterogeneity in individual-level movement behavior and might underlie the leptokurtic patterns that have been observed at the population level in numerous field studies.

AB Red Grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) showed two population density cycles during an 18-yr study on 14 km(2) of heather moorland that formed part of a larger moorland tract in northeast Scotland. Fluctuations on 22 different parts of the study area were somewhat asynchronous. Synchrony between parts decreased with distance. The dependence of densities in adjacent parts upon one another was analyzed in two stages, First, population trajectories were modeled with no time component. Second, the fit of these models was significantly improved by adding a time component. This provided evidence for a demographic wave traveling at 2-3 km/yr. It traveled from the center of the moorland tract toward its margin, which adjoined farms and woodland unoccupied by grouse.

AB Changes in land use, habitat fragmentation, nutrient enrichment, and environmental stress often lead to reduced plant diversity in ecosystems. However, it remains controversial whether these reductions in diversity will affect energy flow and nutrient cycling. Diversity has two components: species richness, or the number of plant species in a given area, and species evenness, or how well distributed abundance or biomass is among species within a community. We experimentally varied species evenness and the identity of the dominant plant species in an old field of Quebec to test whether plant productivity would increase with increasing levels of evenness, and whether relationships would be invariant with respect to species identity.
   Total and belowground biomass increased linearly with increasing levels of evenness after one growing season. These relationships did not depend on the identity of the dominant species. Relationships between aboveground biomass and evenness varied and depended on the identity of the dominant. Our results are largely consistent with the idea that human-influenced reductions in small-scale plant diversity, in this case evenness, will lead to indirect reductions in total primary productivity. Furthermore, because the evenness treatments were not confounded with species identity, our results suggest that diversity has an effect on plant productivity above and beyond the sampling effect (having a higher probability of species with higher growth rates in diverse communities) seen in studies that vary species richness.

AB I studied the dynamic nature of old-growth, eastern U.S. forests by addressing the following questions: (1) How much do stand density, basal area, and size structure vary over rime within several old-growth remnants? (2) How do mortality and growth rates vary with stem size? (3) How much does the importance of individual species vary over time and space? (4) At what rate do snags and stumps form and deteriorate?
   In 1990-1991, I resampled canopy stems within several old-growth remnants in the southern Appalachians, in Hueston Woods State Park, Ohio, and in the Tionesta Scenic and Research Natural Areas, Pennsylvania. I had previously sampled those sites in 1976-1977 using the point-centered quarter method. I remeasured the same trees and measured new trees if the old ones had died or if a new stem closer to the point than the old stem for that quarter had grown to greater than or equal to 25 cm in diameter at breast height.
   Density and basal area changes were small. Density changes equaled -0.33%, -0.52%, and 0.00%/yr for the southern Appalachians, Hueston Woods, and Tionesta sites, respectively. Corresponding basal-area changes were 0.03%, -0.22%, and 0.45%/yr. Mortality increased consistently with stem size in all three areas. However, growth rates of smaller stems more than compensated for the higher mortality rates of larger sterns, so that overall stem size increased between samples. Most species changed little in relative density or basal area. Overall Fagus showed the largest changes between samples, with a small decrease in the southern Appalachians, a larger decrease in Hueston Woods, and an increase in Tionesta. Trees usually died standing, breaking off at a variety of heights. For example, only 6-27% of trees that died were uprooted, depending on region, whereas 16-31% broke at a height of greater than or equal to 16 m. Total snag densities were 15-18 snags/ha.
   In general these stands were marked by slow changes toward fewer, larger stems, even after centuries in which no major disturbances had occurred. However, changes in pathogens, climate, and atmospheric chemistry could change these trends in the future.

AB Sensitivity, the magnitude of change following perturbation, and return rate, the rate of recovery, are two key components of ecological stability. We quantified these properties for phytoplankton in lakes using pulsed nutrient loading as the perturbation. Theory predicts that grazer community structure should influence how phytoplankton respond to pulsed nutrient loading. In particular, phytoplankton in lakes with large, effective grazers such as Daphnia are expected to be less sensitive to, but recover more slowly from, nutrient perturbations than phytoplankton in lakes with smaller grazers. We tested these predictions by adding standardized small and large pulses of nutrients (similar to 10 and similar to 100 mu g P/L of epilimnion; with N at an N: P ratio of similar to 25:1 by mass) to two natural ponds with contrasting grazer communities that resulted from the deliberate addition of planktivorous fishes to one pond. Site-specific responses were examined by conducting the experiment in the same ponds over two consecutive summers (1994 and 1995), but switching the fish treatments between years.
   In both years, phytoplankton in the pond with large-bodied zooplankton grazers were less sensitive to small pulses of nutrients than were phytoplankton in the pond with small grazers, confirming the expectation that large zooplankton can buffer lakes against nutrient perturbations. However, responses to the large nutrient pulse were less consistent: phytoplankton in the pond with large zooplankton were less sensitive to the large perturbation only in 1995. This unexpected result appears to be due mainly to a 2.6 times greater total zooplankton biomass in the pond with small grazers on the day of the large pulse in 1994. Thus, although the presence of large-bodied zooplankton appears to reduce phytoplankton sensitivity to small nutrient pulses, other factors, including zooplankton biomass, need to be incorporated into predictions for phytoplankton responses to large perturbations.
   Consistent with expectations, larger zooplankton appeared to slow recovery from nutrient perturbations, since the pond with fish and small grazers had faster return rates following the large nutrient pulse in both years of the experiment. Differences in life history traits between small and large species of zooplankton appear to account for these differences in recovery rates. Our results thus provide some support for theoretical expectations that management activities which alter grazer community structure may also affect the stability of phytoplankton communities to nutrient perturbations; additional experiments are needed to confirm the generality of this result.

AB We examined the effect of age on breeding performance in male and female Merlins (Falco columbarius) from a natural population using a long-term data set. In the analysis, we examined whether differences in chick hatch date and brood size associated with parents of different ages arose due to selection of superior individuals (differential mortality hypothesis) or to changes within individuals over time (inadequate experience hypothesis). In addition, we examined the effect of longevity on production of recruits and lifetime reproductive success (LRS). In both sexes, breeding performance improved with age. In females, this was mainly the result of disproportionate mortality of inferior breeders, with less evidence to support performance changes within individuals. Among males, changes in breeding performance with age were largely the result of improvements within individuals early in their life (between age 1 and 2+). Production of recruits was not dependent on parental age at the time of breeding for either sex. Recruit production and LRS were both influenced by longevity. so that longer-lived birds produced more offspring over their lifetimes and thereby had a greater probability of producing recruits. The differences between the sexes in terms of age-dependent breeding performance are likely a consequence of the differing roles the two parents play in reproduction. Male Merlins provide most of the food for the pair and their young during the breeding season, and changes in hunting skill with age may account for individual improvements in breeding performance.

AB Physical damage caused by herbivores or artificial clipping is known to induce responses in secondary chemistry as well as increased resistance to further grazing in a large number of terrestrial. vascular plants, but this has only rarely been described for marine algae. In the present study, it was found that a few weeks of grazing by the gastropod Littorina obtusata can induce substantially increased concentrations of phlorotannins in the intertidal brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum. In contrast, grazing by the isopod Idotea granulosa and simulations of herbivory through momentary and continuous clipping caused no significant changes in phlorotannin levels. This indicates a high degree of specificity in the elicitation of chemical responses to physical damage, something which previously has been shown for terrestrial vascular plants but not for marine algae. Ascophyllum plants that had been grazed by L. obtusata were also less susceptible than undamaged plants to further grazing by gastropods, but no such induced resistance was found in the experiments with I. granulosa. Feeding experiments with undamaged Ascophyllum plants and artificial food containing different levels of phlorotannins provided further support for the sensitivity of the feeding behavior of L. obtusata, and the insensitivity of I. granulosa, to intraspecific variation in the phlorotannin content of Ascophyllum. Since L. obtusata is specialized to live and feed on a few fucoid species, including A. nodosum, the results imply that phlorotannins have an important mediating role in the interactions between these macroalgae and L. obtusata. The experimentally induced increase of phlorotannins was consistent with results from phlorotannin analyses of Ascophyllum individuals from natural populations, where plants that had been heavily grazed by L. obtusata contained significantly higher levels of phlorotannins compared to undamaged plants. A held survey of the distribution and abundance of L. obtusata revealed that the density of the gastropod is highly variable at the same spatial scale as the phlorotannin content of Ascophyllum in the study area. These results suggest that grazing by L. obtusata can be an important factor in explaining natural phenotypic variation in the phlorotannin content of Ascophyllum.
   Together with the results from a few other studies on the interactions between meso-herbivores and marine algae, the results of this study support the previously proposed hypothesis that it is feeding by relatively small, less mobile herbivores that is most likely to cue for induced production of defense chemicals in seaweeds. More studies on such interactions may reveal that the apparent rarity of inducible chemical defenses in seaweeds is misleading.

AB Costs of inducible phenotypes are a central component of theoretical treatments for the evolution of plasticity but have proved difficult to measure empirically. I estimated the costs of responding to predators for 15 species of anuran tadpoles, in artificial pond experiments performed over a period of several years. The experiments included a treatment without predators and another treatment with aeshnid dragonfly larvae confined within cages; experimental protocols and ponds were generally similar. Tadpoles in the caged-predator treatment were not at risk of predation, but they responded as if predators were present. The cost of the predator-induced response was estimated by the difference in growth rate or survival between the two treatments. There was considerable variation among species (experiments) in growth and survival. Across all species there was a highly significant reduction in growth rate in the presence of predators, but no tendency for a survival cost of responding to predators. I tested whether particular components of the antipredator response are especially costly by comparing, within a phylogenetic context, the magnitude of costs with the magnitude of predator-induced plasticity in behavior and morphology. The absence of significant correlations in this analysis indicated that evolutionary changes in specific phenotypic responses to predators have not been accompanied by changes in the cost. The prevalence of growth costs of responding to predators, but not survival costs, supports models of induced defenses that assume that fitness costs arise from shifts in allocation of time and energy.

AB In order to evaluate the patterns and processes of food web structure in grasslands, we compiled data from published studies on the relationship between precipitation (which is a predictor of primary productivity in grasslands), plant and herbivore standing crop biomass, and the results of large-herbivore exclosure experiments on plant abundance and composition. Three informative patterns emerged: (1) both producer and herbivore biomass increase across a natural precipitation gradient; (2) the relative effect of large herbivores on plant biomass, inferred from exclosure studies, decreases with increasing precipitation; and (3) the effect of herbivores on changes in plant species composition increases with precipitation. Simple resource-controlled and consumer-controlled food chain models can explain different subsets of these patterns. However, models of heterogeneous food webs that incorporate differences among species within trophic levels, and compositional turnover within such trophic levels, are consistent with all of the reviewed patterns. We suggest that this compositional turnover of plant species, combined with the interactive controlling effects of consumers and resources, may help to explain why studies performed in different areas, and with different methodologies, often draw different conclusions about the patterns and structuring processes in grassland ecosystems.

AB Metrosideros polymorpha is the dominant tree in a wide range of Hawaiian forests, and it produces litter that varies widely in structure and chemistry. Long-term fertilizer experiments have further expanded the range of litter characteristics and have also provided plots that differ substantially in nutrient availability. We used natural and experimentally induced variation in litter characteristics and site nutrient availabilities to determine controls on heterotrophic N-2 fixation (acetylene reduction or AR, calibrated with N-15(2)) in decomposing litter. In a large-scale experiment that evaluated 28 litter types, we found that low-lignin litter fixed substantially more N than did higher-lignin litter (0.9-1.3 vs. 0.06-0.26 mg N/gram initial litter mass, integrated over two years of decomposition). The supply of nutrients other than N had small and inconsistent effects on N-2 fixation. A second experiment then focused on the importance of non-N nutrients, using litter collected from control plots and plots fertilized with P and with all other essential elements except N (abbreviated "T"), and decomposed in plots that had been fertilized with P, T, and P + T for 12 yr. Litter from P-fertilized plots supported significantly greater AR activity; however, the increase could be explained by decreased lignin concentrations in litter produced in P-fertilized plots.
   Related studies on controls of decomposition rates in Hawaiian montane forests show that the decomposition of low-lignin litter is increased substantially by added N, while that of high-lignin litter is increased less or not at all. The extent to which decomposition is N-limited correlates strongly with the integrated quantity of N fixed during decomposition. We conclude that low carbon quality of litter, indicated by high lignin concentrations, constrains decomposition and heterotrophic N-2 fixation in Hawaiian montane forests, even where N supply limits net primary production. This disconnection in resource limitation between producers and decomposers contributes to the maintenance of N limitation in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Our study quantified the nutrients and energy introduced into the nesting beach at Melbourne Beach, Florida, from distant foraging grounds by loggerhead sea turtles, Caretta caretta. The fate of eggs deposited into 97 nests was determined by monitoring nests throughout incubation. The organic matter, energy, lipid, nitrogen, and phosphorus content of fresh eggs, eggs at successive stages of development, hatchlings, and hatching remains were determined. From these analyses, we estimated the flow of energy and nutrients introduced into the 14 305 nests (similar to 1.6 X 10(6) eggs) deposited in a 21-km stretch of Melbourne Beach in 1996. We quantified the amount of energy and nutrients incorporated into each of four pathways: ingested by nest predators; consumed by detritivores, decomposers, and plants; lost as metabolic heat or gases during embryological development and hatching; or returned to the ocean as hatchlings. Each nest introduced a mean of 688 g of organic matter, 18 724 kJ of energy, 151 g of lipids, 72 g of nitrogen, and 6.5 g of phosphorus into the beach. Twenty-five percent of the organic matter, 27% of the energy, 34% of the lipids, 29% of the nitrogen, and 39% of the phosphorus introduced into the nests returned to the ocean as hatchlings. Quantities of energy and nutrients transported by the turtles are comparable to quantities moved by other important biological transporters. Human activities have substantially altered the quantity of energy and nutrients transported, and the distribution of those nutrients on the beach. By introducing nutrients into beach ecosystems, sea turtles may help maintain stable dune systems that are critical to their reproductive success.

AB S. M. Arthur and colleagues presented a statistical framework that allows habitat availability to change for each observation of an animal, thus making habitat-use analysis possible when the habitat changes or it is difficult to determine a home range for each individual. I here modify their method by letting habitat availability vary on a continuous scale, rather than defining the area within a circle as equally available. The modified method also makes it possible to deal with continuously varying time intervals between observations and the influence of environmental variables (e.g., temperature, time of day) on movement activity. As an example, I use this method to analyze habitat selection of a bush-cricket (the wart-biter, Decticus verrucivorus).

AB Animals reflect the stable isotope ratios (delta(15)N and delta(13)C) of their diet, with a slight enrichment in N-15 that allows the use of delta(15)N as a trophic-level indicator Stable isotope contents were measured for the litter, soil, and macro-invertebrates of three temperate deciduous forest sites, in spring, summer, and autumn, to study the trophic structure of this community. No distinct trophic structure could be derived from measurements of delta(13)C. In contrast, when the delta(15)N values of all animal species were grouped together, the hypothesis of an isotopically similar diet was rejected. Therefore, the community spreads over more than one trophic level and was subdivided into detritivores and predators. The potential detritivore food sources in the forest litter and soil showed a variety of isotopic ratios. Despite this fact. the variance of the isotopic ratios of the detritivorous species was nor larger than what could be expected from interspecific variability of trophic isotopic enrichment alone. This was also the case for the predators in most of the sample sets. However, in some cases this variance was significantly larger, due to a small number of species with high delta(15)N values. The delta(15)N values of the detritivores indicated that the mean delta(15)N value of their food was close to that measured for the superficial litter layers. The difference in delta(15)N between detritivores and predators was highly significant and never significantly different from the value expected fur one trophic transfer (3.4 parts per thousand), although often slightly higher. Most of the litter macro-invertebrate community we studied can therefore be described as belonging to two trophic levels, one feeding on the superficial litter layers (or on soil fractions that have a similar delta(15)N value), and a second trophic level feeding on the first, with some indication of intraguild predation among the predators.
   Between-site differences of up to 7 parts per thousand were found for delta(15)N in the litter, and the delta(15)N values of the whole animal community were shifted in accordance with the local value of the litter delta(15)N. Therefore, the trophic structure must be studied in relation to the local isotopic content of the litter. Seasonal differences in isotopic ratios of the litter or animal samples were neither large nor consistent. These findings indicate similar trophic structure of the communities at the three sites and during the three sampling periods.

AB We used normalized size spectra analysis (originally developed in the study of pelagic communities) and a fish bioenergetics model to examine whether predation by fishes affects the size structure of macrobenthos, We conducted the study over five years in three north temperate lakes in which fish were experimentally manipulated while allowing for natural recruitment and mortality in lakes with fish. The resulting variation in predator populations allowed us to address how prey community size structure responds to a gradient of predation pressure. The slopes of normalized size spectra were used to characterize whether community biomass is relatively distributed as smaller or larger individuals with regard to mass. We ask whether predator effects on prey are manifested through fish presence/absence or if a gradient of predation pressure is important. Tn addition, we examined whether consumption rate of prey by fish is a better measure of predation effects on prey size structure than fish biomass alone.
   Our results suggest that benthos size structure responds to a gradient of fish consumption, rather than a qualitative distinction of fish presence or absence. Consumption rates by fish on benthos explained more of the variation in slopes of normalized size spectra of benthos than fish biomass alone. Slope values were more variable at lower consumption rates, which included no predation by fish. Conversely, high consumption rates by fish produced consistent, predictable body size distributions of benthos in which large individuals were relatively underrepresented. However, these results may not be apparent through more traditional analyses based on predator or prey presence/absence, abundance, or taxonomic based measures. Generalizations addressing patterns of body size distributions within and among ecosystems may be advanced by examining predation and other underlying size structuring mechanisms.

AB The fitness consequences of self-fertilization are largely determined by how self-pollination occurs. Within-flower self-pollination (autogamy) may be advantageous, since it can provide reproductive assurance without much seed or pollen discounting. In contrast, between-flower self-pollination (geitonogamy) provides no reproductive assurance and can cause severe seed and pollen discounting. I used floral emasculations with marker gene analysis to estimate the components of self-fertilization ina tristylous, self-compatible, clonal, mass-flowering plant, Decodon verticillatus. This species produces 30% of progeny through selfing. I assessed the contribution of autogamy to selling by comparing pollen deposition, seed production, and the selfing rate of flowers emasculated before anther dehiscence with intact flowers. Emasculation had no effect on pollen deposition, caused a small increase in seed production, and only reduced self-fertilization by 14%, suggesting that most selfing occurs through geitonogamy. Geitonogamy can be due to self-pollination between flowers on the same branch, different flowering branches of the same plant, or different ramets of the same clonal genet. I assessed the contribution of within-branch geitonogamy by emasculating all flowers on a branch, which reduced selfing from 0.29 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- 1 SE) to 0.19 +/- 0.04. Between-branch geitonogamy was estimated by comparing the selfing rate of plants with only a single flowering branch (0.16 +/- 0.07) to plants with multiple flowering branches (0.27 +/- 0.04). Selfing rates of individual branches also correlated positively with the daily number of flowers open on nonfocal branches of the same plant. Between-ramet geitonogamy was suggested by significant self-fertilization by single-branch plants, even when all flowers were emasculated (0.10 +/- 0.07). Selfing rates of individual branches also correlated negatively with measures of local clonal diversity. Based on these results, autogamy accounts for only 18 +/- 14% of self-fertilization, with the remainder (82 +/- 17%) due to geitonogamy, which occurs about equally through pollination within branches (31 +/- 22%), between branches (38 +/- 32%), and between ramets (31 +/- 28%). Because selfing occurs mostly through geitonogamy and is associated with strong inbreeding depression, it seems disadvantageous. Selfing in D. verticillutus has probably not been selected directly, but is a by-product of self-compatibility, large plant size, mass-flowering, and clonal propagation.

AB Permanent plots in old-growth hemlock-northern hardwood forests of Michigan's upper peninsula have been remeasured over periods of 16-32 yr. A gradient from hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) to sugar maple (Acer saccharum) dominance is associated with increasing soil pH and calcium. Secondary species include yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) and basswood (Tilia americana). From 1962 to 1994 hemlock increased in basal area and dominance in most plots. Sugar maple showed little overall change, while basswood and especially yellow birch showed sporadic but often large declines in basal area. Birch populations declined due to lack of recruitment, and sugar maple and basswood may be subject to similar decline; only hemlock showed a fairly stable size structure. Mortality rates were lowest for hemlock (0.3%/yr) and highest for yellow birch (1.6%/yr), corresponding to canopy residence times of 357 and 61 yr, respectively. Stem maps allowed assessment of neighborhood influences on growth and mortality. Growth and mortality rates were negatively correlated for all species. Growth rate was influenced by tree size and site conditions for all species, but hemlock and sugar maple growth rates were also affected by size- and distance-weighted indices of neighbor influence. Old-growth stands several centuries old continue to undergo compositional change related to both stand history and current population interactions. Yellow birch and basswood are probably maintained by significant disturbances and will decline under a disturbance regime of small gaps. Hemlock may be the ultimate competitive dominant in most sites but may require well over a millennium without major disturbance to displace sugar maple.

AB In order to explore the extent to which interactions between pairs of species embedded in complex multispecies food webs are nonlocalized, in terms of the number of other species that need to be taken into account, the influence of other species in the system on the response of the hake fishery to a cull of fur seals is calculated in a 29-species food web for the Benguela ecosystem. Parameters are assigned biologically plausible values, partly through energetic and allometric reasoning. It is found that behaviorally mediated effects within the multispecies functional response can produce a highly diffuse response.

AB Ecologists are increasingly finding that complex combinations of competitive and facilitative interactions influence the distribution and abundance of plants. I conducted a two-year field experiment to explore these processes in a streamside community lining the South Fork Eel River in northern California. Specifically, I tested the hypothesis that the sedge Carex nudata provides critical stable substrate for other plants during winter floods and protection from herbivores over the growing season. In addition to these facilitative effects, Carer is also hypothesized to compete with the associated species, and thus limit their size and reproduction.
   To evaluate these hypotheses, I followed the performance of transplanted individuals of Mimulus guttatus, M. cardinalis, Juncus covillei, Conocephalum conicum, and Brachythecium frigidum and naturally occurring individuals of Epipactis gigantea on Carer tussocks with dense, thinned, pinned back, or completely clipped Carer stems. The five transplanted species were also planted directly onto the emergent streambed. Though streambed transplants grew as well as those on tussocks over the summer, they experienced significantly greater winter mortality, up to 100%, supporting the hypothesis that tussocks provide a critical stable substrate. In contrast, growing season competition by Carer reduced biomass by over 50% for five of the six species and reduced reproductive performance by over 60%. Also, over the growing season, Carex protected M. guttatus and Epipactis from insect larvae and deer, respectively, reducing herbivory by >75%. Additional results from a deer exclosure treatment showed that the positive effects of this "associational defense" were equal in magnitude to the negative effects of Carer competition on Epipactis biomass. The mechanisms underlying these associational defenses and the implications of my results for the relationship between disturbance and facilitation are discussed. I suggest that regarding plant interactions as combinations of facilitative and competitive components may enhance our understanding of natural communities.

AB We examine how spatial subdivision of predator-prey systems affects colonization processes in metapopulations. Dynamics of the herbivorous spider mite Tetranychus urticae (prey) and the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis are highly unstable on isolated bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus) and ultimately result in extinction of prey and predators. Assembling a collection of 90 plants without any dispersal barriers (a super island experiment) does not modify the persistence of the predator-prey system. Subdividing the system into a metapopulation with barriers for dispersal (a collection of eight islands with 10 plants per island) leads to persistence of the predator-prey dynamics for many generations. In this paper, we use the time series of colonization events and prey and predator densities from the super-island and metapopulation experiments to understand how colonization processes of prey and predatory mites are altered by spatial subdivision. Using survival analysis, we estimate how prey and predator colonization probability is affected by densities of the colonist pool at different distances from the target plant. Contrasting the results from the super-island and metapopulation experiments reveals that spatial subdivision affects the discovery rate of prey outbreaks by predatory mites and differentially affects colonization by prey and predators. Prey colonization is primarily determined by local densities of prey in spatially subdivided systems, whereas predator colonization retains primarily "global" influences. Our analysis of colonization processes suggests mechanisms accounting for stability in the metapopulation experiments and provides the quantitative basis for the development of colonization functions to explore these mechanisms in predator-prey models of acarine systems.

AB Physiological integration between ramets has been observed in several clonal plant species. But consequences of integration on the competitive ability and spatial development of genets have received little attention so far. This study is an attempt to examine the population- and community-level implications of integration in a spatially explicit model.
   We have simulated different resource patterns in a cellular automata, varying the proportion (p) and size (s) of resource-rich patches and the average resource level in the area (h). We compared the efficiency of integrator to splitter genets in exploring and utilizing the resource patches. In the integrator, ramets that belonged to the same genet were physiologically connected and shared the resource taken up by any part of the genet. In the splitter, all ramets were autonomous. i.e., survival and reproduction of each ramet only depended on the local resource conditions. Thus, the integrator sensed and responded to environmental heterogeneity on a larger spatial scale than the splitter. Integration can be interpreted as sharing the risk of genet mortality among interconnected ramets, while splitting represents risk spreading among autonomous ramets. In each simulated habitat type, we followed the course of competition between splitter and integrator genets for 500 generations.
   First, we examined the effect of environmental heterogeneity on the result of competition. We fixed the average resource level in the area and changed the spatial distribution of the resource by varying p and s. We found that the smaller the proportion of favorable sites, the better it is to integrate. But already a small deviation from random to clumped resource distribution (i.e., relatively small s) made the integrator competitively inferior to the splitter. In the next step, we varied the overall resource richness in the area. High productivity of the habitat promoted the dominance of integrators. The simulations demonstrated that there were habitat types in which one of the strategies (the integrator or the splitter) rapidly excluded its competitor. But at the medium range of environmental parameters, long-term coexistence of the strategies became possible. As integration proceeded simultaneously with horizontal growth and exploration of new patches, integrators remarkably differed from splitters in their pattern of space occupation. A spatial statistical analysis revealed that splitters maintained strong spatial association with the resource: splitting promoted habitat selection. Integration, on the other hand, led to gap-filling, fugitive spatial behavior. For a range of realistic habitat patterns, we need not expect the exclusion of any of the pure strategies-splitters and integrators can coexist.

AB Bimodal patch occupancy frequency distributions regularly appear in studies of a variety of taxa at a variety of spatial scales. Metapopulation models associated with the core-satellite hypothesis and a strong rescue effect predict the occurrence of this bimodality. However, there have been numerous other explanations, both artifactual and biological, of bimodality in patch occupancy frequency distributions. One approach to a better understanding of the phenomenon is to conduct studies on a variety of taxa and spatial scales. Here we examine patterns of patch occupancy frequency distributions for plants, dung beetles, and birds at four spatial scales in sand forest and mixed woodland in Tembe Elephant Park and Sileza Nature Reserve in South Africa. We then examine the predictions of each alternative mechanism proposed to explain bimodality with respect to the patterns found in this study. The incidence of bimodality was high. Little evidence was found for any of the artifactual or nonmetapopulation-based explanations of bimodality. Although there were no between-taxon differences in the shape of occupancy distributions, there was a clear trend of decreasing frequency of bimodality with an increase in the size of the area examined. The general shape of range-size frequency distributions in combination with an area effect is suggested as a mechanism underlying this pattern. Metapopulation dynamics associated with a strong rescue effect could also not be excluded as a possible mechanism playing a role in generating the bimodality found at the patch scale.

ID STABILITY
AB Community ecologists have long sought to understand the basis for two apparently conflicting observations. The first is the evident persistence of complex communities through time. The second is the theoretical result that, in general, complex model communities are less likely to be stable than simpler ones. Previous attempts to reconcile these observations have studied the average properties of model communities constructed under a variety of different assumptions. The problem with such studies is that the set of all possible models, even when subject to strict constraints, is very large relative to the subset that may be representative of real communities, and it is unclear which constraints to apply. Here, it is assumed that real communities are a highly restricted subset of all possible models, and attention is focused instead on properties of communities constructed to be as stable as they could be. Geometrically derived analytic results show that in general, communities constructed in this way require high levels of connectance, as measured by the product of the strength and frequency of interspecific interaction. In particular, connectance between weakly and strongly self-regulated elements of these communities is of critical importance.

AB Abandonment and reforestation of agricultural lands has been a major influence on the landscape of eastern North America. Cultivation and soil amendments can dramatically alter soil nutrient pools and cycling, yet few studies have examined the longterm (>50 yr) influence of pasturing and cultivation on soil processes in the forests that develop after abandonment. Twelve forested sites at Harvard Forest in central New England were compared 90-120 yr after abandonment from agricultural use. We measured soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P); light fraction C, N. and delta(15)N; microbial chloroform-N; net N mineralization and nitrification; nitrification potential, and culturable nitrifiers on sites with differing land-use history and vegetation. The sites had similar soil series and topography but were arrayed along a soil disturbance gradient from permanent woodlots (selective logging but no mineral soil disturbance) to formerly pastured sites (clearcut and grazed but no deep [>10 cm] soil disturbance) to formerly cultivated sites (cleared-with-plow horizon 15-20 cm thick). Mineral soil C (0-15 cm soil depth) was very similar among all sites, but the forest floor C was lower in the cultivated sites than in the woodlots of both stand types. Mineral soil in cultivated sites contained 800 kg N/ha and 300 kg P/ha more than woodlots, a relative increase of 39% for N and 52% for P. The cultivated soils had lower C:N and C:P ratios, largely driven by higher soil N and P. The light fraction appeared to be more sensitive to prior land use than the bulk soil organic matter. The C content and C:N ratio of light fraction were lower in cultivated soils, which suggests that input and/or turnover of organic matter pools of relatively recent origin remain altered for a century after abandonment. Similar delta(15)N for the light and heavy fraction organic matter pools in cultivated soils suggests that cultivation accelerates the mineralization of humus N, increasing the proportion of N available for plant uptake, resulting in a convergence of the light and heavy fractions. The N pool in the woodlot soils may have been subject to preferential losses of small amounts of (14)N over a longer time period, resulting in a more pronounced divergence between the light fraction (reflecting recent plant inputs) and the mineral-associated heavy fraction (more recalcitrant).
   Nitrification was strongly influenced by land-use history, with highest rates in formerly cultivated sites. In contrast, soil net N mineralization and chloroform-N were more strongly influenced by present vegetation. Nitrifying bacteria were relatively abundant in all pastured and cultivated sites: however, only the cultivated hardwood sites, with lowest C:N ratios (16-18), had substantial net nitrification. Historical manure inputs may explain the more rapid soil net nitrification rates, by decreasing soil C:N ratios and thus reducing nitrate immobilization in the mineral soil of cultivated sites. Regionally, 65% of the land area was pastured, and a proportion of the nutrients obtained from grazing was transferred to the cultivated croplands, which comprise less than or equal to 15% of the land area. Pastures generally had intermediate nutrient ratios and N transformations but were often more similar to woodlots, which suggests that plowing and amendments, rather than forest clearance, have the greatest impact on soil organic matter and nutrients. The influence of land-use history on soil N and P and nitrification rates was more dramatic in hardwood sites, which indicates that characteristics of the recovering vegetation and/or changes in plant community composition associated with prior land use are important factors in the rate of recovery. Our findings lead to the surprising conclusion that 19th century agricultural practices decreased forest floor nutrient content and ratios, and increased nitrifier populations and net nitrate production for approximately a century after abandonment. Consideration of site history clearly deserves more attention in the design of field experiments, and in our understanding of patterns of element distributions and transformations in dynamic forested landscapes.

AB I investigated mechanisms of parasitoid coexistence in a spatially structured host-multiparasitoid community (harlequin bugs [Murgantia histrionica] and two specialist parasitoids [Trissolcus murgantiae and Ooencyrtus johnsonii]), I tested both local and metapopulation hypotheses. The local hypothesis, intraguild predation, predicts coexistence if the inferior larval competitor is superior at finding unparasitized hosts. Hence, the superior larval competitor should be absent from patches of low host productivity. The metapopulation hypothesis, dispersal-competition trade-off, predicts coexistence if the inferior competitor is a superior disperser. Hence, the superior larval competitor should be absent from patches isolated by distance. Manipulative experiments demonstrate that coexistence does not require a dispersal advantage to the inferior larval competitor. Field surveys show that patches from which the superior larval competitor is absent are not the most isolated, but the least productive. In a natural experiment, loss of the superior larval competitor was not associated with habitat loss or fragmentation that increases distance among occupied patches, but with a large reduction in host productivity. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that parasitoid coexistence occurs via local interactions rather than spatial processes, This study provides the first empirical evidence of the role of spatiotemporal variation in host productivity on parasitoid coexistence. The results have implications for multiparasitoid food webs in patchy environments and offer practical insights regarding the release of multiple parasitoid species in pest control.

AB Single species can have large effects on entire communities through habitat modification and facilitation. I tested the general hypothesis that the intertidal grass Spartina alterniflora facilitates the establishment and persistence of New England cobble beach plant communities by modifying the shoreline environment. This community is dominated by halophytic forbs and is restricted to estuarine cobble beaches bordered by Spartina. Beds of Spartina can reduce mean water velocity by 50% and maximum velocity by nearly an order of magnitude, and they can substantially stabilize the cobble substrate. Specifically, I determined the importance of five life history stages (seed supply, seed germination, seedling emergence, seedling establishment, and adult survival) and four factors (water velocity, substrate stability, herbivory, and soil quality) in limiting lateral plant distribution. A seed addition experiment demonstrated that seedlings could only emerge behind Spartina, suggesting that seedling emergence is the proximate life history stage limiting adult distribution. Seed germination and adult survival do not appear to be limiting stages, at least in an absolute sense. Although seed supply was much greater (similar to 10-100x) behind Spartina, a substantial number of seeds were caught in seed traps placed between beds, suggesting that seed supply also does not limit absolute plant distribution. These results are supported by the presence of seedlings buried below the substrate surface between beds at the time when seedlings are naturally emerging behind beds. A manipulative field experiment was performed to test the effects of substrate instability, soil quality, and herbivory on seedling emergence between beds. Seeds of two annual cobble beach species (Suaeda linearis and Salicornia europaea) were added to plots behind Spartina and also between beds with and without substrate stabilization manipulations. This treatment was designed to stabilize the substrate in a manner that would not affect water velocity and soil characteristics or prevent access by potential herbivores. When not buffered by Spartina, seedlings of both species were only able to emerge and survive when the substrate was artificially stabilized. These results indicate that Spartina alterniflora facilitates the establishment and persistence of cobble beach plant communities by stabilizing the substrate and enabling seedlings to emerge and survive.

AB Theory suggests that species with particular traits are at greater risk of extinction than others. We assumed that a decline in abundance in forest fragments, compared to continuous forest, equated to an increase in extinction risk. We then tested the relationships between five traits of species and decline in abundance for 69 beetle species in an experimentally fragmented forest landscape at Mt. Wog Wog in southeastern Australia. The experiment was controlled and replicated. Monitoring ran for two years before forest fragmentation; in this paper, we examine data for five years postfragmentation. We tested five hypotheses: (1) Species that occur naturally at low abundance are more likely to decline as a result of fragmentation than are abundant species. (2) Isolated species are more likely to decline than species that are not isolated. (3) Large species are more likely to decline than small species. (4) Species in trophic groups at the top end of food chains are more likely to decline than species in trophic groups lower in the food chain. (5) Because traits are often shared by related species, populations of more closely related species will respond in the same way.
   We found that: (1) rare species were more likely to decline than abundant species; (2) isolated species were more likely to decline than species that were not isolated; (3) body size was not correlated with response to fragmentation; (4) among species that declined, predators declined most; and (5) taxonomically related species did not respond in the same way to fragmentation. Thus, our results confirm theories predicting that isolated, rare, or predaceous species will be lost first from fragmented landscapes.

AB Predators affect dynamics of prey populations not only by decreasing their survivorship, but also by changing other vital rates such as growth and reproduction. However, such nonlethal effects have rarely been examined experimentally in the field. In North Carolina estuaries, the hard clam Mercenaria mercenaria generally shows lower growth rates in habitats where predation rates are higher. Predator avoidance behavior of the clams (feeding inhibition) might be one of the factors responsible for this correlation. To examine possible effects of predators on clam growth, I first compared variation in clam growth rate among habitats with different predation pressure, and between predator-exclusion cages and uncaged controls. I then carried out a predator-enclosure experiment using the clam and the whelk Busycon cal-ica, a major predator on adult clams.
   Among-habitat variation in survivorship, predation rate, and growth rate was generally small or not detected in winter, while large variation was found for adult clams in spring, their major growing season. Growth rate of adults was highest in a mud bottom where survivorship was highest (>60%) due to low predation rates, and it was lowest in an oyster shell bottom where survivorship was lowest (<10%). For juveniles, on the other hand, growth rate did not differ significantly among habitats, nor did survivorship. Clams in the predator-exclusion cages showed nearly twice the growth rate of uncaged controls in spring but not in winter. Clam growth rates were thus lower in habitats with lower survivorship and higher predation rates, suggesting that the predators can affect growth rates.
   In the whelk-enclosure experiment, the clams were enclosed in cages with three different treatments: (1) with whelks capable of attacking clams, (2) with whelks isolated from the prey, and (3) without whelks (control). The shell and somatic growth rates of the clam were at least twice as high in the control than in the two experimental treatments. However, the growth rates did not differ significantly between the two experimental treatments. The clam growth rates were therefore reduced in the presence of whelks even with no direct contact between whelks and clams, suggesting that the decrease in growth rates is due to a behavioral response of the prey to indirect cues, such as water-borne chemical signals produced by whelks.
   These findings show that predatory whelks can affect clam population dynamics not only by decreasing survivorship directly, but also by decreasing future reproduction and survivorship indirectly by suppressing growth rates, and that the predator-avoidance behavior observed in previous studies has significant demographic consequences. The non lethal effects of predation on clam growth rate may also be responsible for observed variation in growth rates among habitats.

AB Hatchling painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) commonly overwinter within their natal nests and survive exposure to temperatures as low as -12 degrees C by supercooling. We report that the supercooling capacity of hatchling C. picta is reduced by direct contact with nest soil which, in samples from northwestern and north-central Nebraska, Indiana, and Ontario, contained potent ice nuclei active in the range of -3.5 degrees to -5 degrees C. These nuclei were sensitive to autoclaving and extractable in water. The supercooling capacity of C. picta hatched in native nest soil, or hatched in sterilized vermiculite (which lacks water-extractable nuclei), and subsequently exposed to nest soil, was reduced by similar to 10 degrees C relative to control turtles that were hatched and reared in sterilized vermiculite. The effect of these nuclei was potentiated by the presence of environmental moisture, although even transient exposure to dry nest soil markedly reduced supercooling capacity in similar to 50% of the turtles. Unlike turtle species that hibernate underwater (Sternotherus odoratus. Chelydra serpentina, Apalone spinifera), hatchlings of C. picta exhibited an extraordinary capacity for supercooling (temperature of crystallization, - 16 degrees C to - 20 degrees C) when cooled in isolation from external ice nuclei. However, hatchlings of these four species were equally susceptible to inoculation by suspensions of the ice-nucleating bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae. Indirect evidence suggests that the soil nuclei are associated with such microbes. Nucleating activity was higher in soil collected within nests than in soil collected at the same depth, adjacent to these nests. Differences in the activities of ice nuclei in nesting soils may account for geographic and local variation in winter survival of hatchling C. picta. Our finding that similar agents occur in various other terrestrial habitats in central North America suggests that such nuclei may pose a formidable challenge to the overwintering survival of ectothermic animals that rely on supercooling to withstand frost exposure.
