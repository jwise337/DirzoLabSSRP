AB The theory of alternate stable states provides an explanation for rapid ecosystem degradation, yielding important implications for ecosystem conservation and restoration. However, utilizing this theory to initiate transitions from degraded to desired ecosystem states remains a significant challenge. Applications of the alternative stable states framework may currently be impeded by a mismatch between local-scale driving processes and landscape-scale emergent system transitions. We show how nucleation theory provides an elegant bridge between local-scale positive feedback mechanisms and landscape-scale transitions between alternate stable ecosystem states. Geometrical principles can be used to derive a critical patch radius: a spatially explicit, local description of an unstable equilibrium point. This insight can be used to derive an optimal patch size that minimizes the cost of restoration, and to provide a framework to measure the resilience of desired ecosystem states to the synergistic effects of disturbance and environmental change.

AB The ability of random environmental variation to stabilize competitor coexistence was pointed out long ago and, in recent years, has received considerable attention. Analyses have focused on variations in the log abundances of species, with mean logarithmic growth rates when rare,Er, used as metrics for persistence. However, invasion probabilities and the times to extinction are not single-valued functions ofErand, in some cases, decrease asErincreases. Here, we present a synthesis of stochasticity-induced stabilization (SIS) phenomena based on the ratio between the expected arithmetic growth mu and its varianceg. When the diffusion approximation holds, explicit formulas for invasion probabilities and persistence times are single-valued, monotonic functions of mu/g. The storage effect in the lottery model, together with other well-known examples drawn from population genetics, microbiology, and ecology (including discrete and continuous dynamics, with overlapping and non-overlapping generations), are placed together, reviewed, and explained within this new, transparent theoretical framework. We also clarify the relationships between life-history strategies and SIS, and study the dynamics of extinction when SIS fails.

AB Climate warming is facilitating the expansion of many cold-sensitive woody species in woodland-grassland ecotones worldwide. Recent research has demonstrated that this range expansion can be further enhanced by positive vegetation-microclimate feedbacks whereby woody canopies induce local nocturnal warming, which reduces freeze-induced damage and favors the establishment of woody plants. However, this local positive feedback can be counteracted by biotic drivers such as browsing and the associated consumption of shrub biomass. The joint effects of large-scale climate warming and local-scale microclimate feedbacks on woody vegetation dynamics in these ecotones remain poorly understood. Here, we used a combination of experimental and modeling approaches to investigate the effects of woody cover on microclimate and the consequent implications on ecological stability in North American coastal ecosystems. We found greater browsing pressure and significant warming (similar to 2 degrees C) beneath shrub canopies compared to adjacent grasslands, which reduces shrub seedlings' exposure to cold damage. Cold sensitivity is evidenced by the significant decline in xylem hydraulic conductivity in shrub seedlings when temperatures dropped below -2 degrees C. Despite the negative browsing-vegetation feedback, a small increase in minimum temperature can induce critical transitions from grass to woody plant dominance. Our framework also predicts the threshold temperature of -7 degrees C for mangrove-salt marsh ecotones on the Atlantic coast of Florida. Above this reference temperature a critical transition may occur from salt marsh to mangrove vegetation, in agreement with empirical studies. Thus, the interaction between ongoing global warming trends and microclimate feedbacks may significantly alter woody vegetation dynamics and ecological stability in coastal ecosystems where woody plant expansion is primarily constrained by extreme low temperature events.

AB Understanding what makes food webs stable has long been a goal of ecologists. Topological structure and the distribution and magnitude of interaction strengths in food webs have been shown to confer important stabilizing properties. However, our understanding of how variable species interactions affect food-web structure and stability is still in its infancy. Anthropogenic stress, such as acid mine drainage, is likely to place severe limitations on the food-web structures availabe, due to changes in community composition and body mass distributions. Here, we used mechanistic models to infer food-web structure and quantify stability in streams across a gradient of acid mine drainage. Multiple food webs were iterated for each community based on species pairwise interaction probabilities, in order to incorporate the variability of realistic food-web structure. We found that food-web structure was altered systematically with a 32-fold decrease in the number of links and a twofold increase in connectance across the gradient. Stability generally increased sixfold with increasing acid mine drainage stress, regardless of how interaction strengths were estimated. However, the distribution of the stability measure,s, for some impacted communities separated into clusters of higher and lower magnitude depending on how interaction strengths were estimated. Management and restoration of impacted sites needs to consider their increased stability, as this may have important implications for the recolonization of desirable species. Furthermore, active species introductions may be required to overcome the internal ecological inertia of affected communities.

AB Historical comparisons of body size often lack pertinent details, including information on the sampling protocol and relevant ecological covariates that influence body size. Moreover, historical estimates of body size that rely on museum specimens may be biased towards larger size classes because of collector preferences, and thus size thresholds have been used to focus attention on maximum body size. We tested the consequences of sampling design, ecological covariates, and size thresholds on inferences of body-size change using field-contextualized historical records, rather than museum specimens. In 2014-2015, we revisited historical (1947-1963) size-frequency distributions of three gastropods (Tegula funebralis,Lottia digitalis/L. austrodigitalis,Littorina keenae) in the context of population density and tidal height. In general, gastropods declined in size. However, our inferences regarding body-size decline were tempered when the variation between sampling units was taken into consideration, resulting in greater uncertainty around the estimate of proportional change in body size. Gastropod size was correlated with population density and tidal height, and these relationships varied over time. Finally, the magnitude and direction of body-size change varied with the amount of data available for analysis, demonstrating that the use of size thresholds can lead to incomplete conclusions.

AB Environmental conditions that vary from year to year can be strong drivers of ecological dynamics, including the composition of newly assembled communities. However, ecologists often chalk such dynamics up to "noise" in ecological experiments. Our lack of attention to such "year effects" hampers our understanding of contingencies in ecological assembly mechanisms and limits the generalizability of research findings. Here, we provide examples from published research demonstrating the importance of year effects during community assembly across study systems. We further quantify these year effects with two case studies-a grassland restoration experiment and a study of postfire conifer recruitment-finding that the effects of initiation year on community composition can dictate community as much, if not more, than the effects of experimental treatments or site. The evidence strongly suggests that year effects are pervasive and profound, and that year effects early in community assembly can drive strong and enduring divergence in community structure and function. Explicit attention to year effects in ecological research serves to illuminate basic ecological principles, allowing for better understanding of contingencies in ecology. These dynamics also have strong implications for applied ecological research, offering new insights into ecological restoration as well as future climate change.

AB Intraspecific differentiation across a steep environmental gradient depends on the relative influences of evolutionary, organismal, and environmental processes. But steep environmental gradients may be nested within larger-scale, regional conditions that could influence these processes at the local scale. Therefore, we hypothesized that phenotypic differentiation along a steep environmental gradient would vary among regions. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment on rocky intertidal shores, a habitat characterized by gradients in abiotic and biotic stress, in three regions of the Gulf of Maine. We used the ubiquitous and ecologically important rockweed speciesFucus vesiculosusto quantify differentiation in growth, tissue nitrogen, and nitrogen productivity between upper and lower intertidal individuals. We found that phenotypic differentiation between tide heights varied among traits and regions. Although tissue nitrogen did not vary among any treatment combinations, growth and nitrogen productivity response were region specific. A strong effect of transplant height was found in all regions; however, an effect of home (source) height was only detectable in the central Gulf of Maine. Our study reveals that intraspecific responses to steep environmental gradients vary among populations, but the mechanisms underlying these patterns remain unknown. Given the roles that rockweeds play as food and habitat, these in situ patterns of growth and nitrogen productivity could have important community- and ecosystem-level consequences.

AB Physiological responses to ocean acidification are thought to be related to energetic trade-offs. Although a number of studies have proposed that negative responses to low pH could be minimized in situations where food resources are more readily available, evidence for such effects on individuals remain mixed, and the consequences of such effects at the community level remain untested. We explored the potential for food availability and diet quality to modify the effects of acidification on developing marine fouling communities in field-deployed mesocosms by supplementing natural food supply with one of two species of phytoplankton, differing in concentration of fatty acids. After 12 weeks, no species demonstrated the interactive effects generally predicted in the literature, where a positive overall effect of diet mitigated the negative overall effects of acidification. Rather, for some species, additional food supply appeared to bring out or exacerbate the negative effects of low pH. Community richness and structure were only altered by acidification, while space occupation and evenness reflected patterns of the most dominant species. Importantly, we find that acidification stress can increase the relative abundance of invasive species, even under resource conditions that otherwise prevented invasive species establishment. Overall, the proposed hypothesis regarding the ability for food addition to mitigate the negative effects of acidification is thus far not widely supported at species or community levels. It is clear that acidification is a strong driving force in these communities but understanding underlying energetic and competitive context is essential to developing mechanistic predictions for climate change responses.

AB Individual diet specialization (IS) has important community- and population-level implications and its ecological drivers are actively investigated. Here, to test the hypothesis that local environmental conditions may influence IS in wild populations, we analyzed the stomach contents of 395 individuals from eight populations of five allopatric species of European cave salamanders (genusHydromantes). We assessed whether their degree of individual diet specialization (1) scaled positively with the respective niche widths, in agreement with Van Valen's niche variation hypothesis (NVH), and (2) could be predicted by satellite-derived climatic and vegetation characteristics of the sites where the populations live. Consistent with the NVH, the degree of individual diet specialization increased with the populations' total niche width. Furthermore, two variables describing local nonarboreal vegetation cover and habitat heterogeneity successfully predicted the variation in individual specialization across the eight populations. Climatic factors had a generally low predictive power, with individual specialization in low- and high-elevation populations showing contrasting patterns of co-variation with air temperature in the warmest quarter of the year. However, independently from elevation, specialization peaked under conditions of high nonarboreal vegetation cover and high precipitation regimes. We discussed the results against two mutually nonexclusive scenarios hypothesizing different mechanisms linking environmental factors to salamanders' trophic strategy at an individual and population level. We concluded that satellite-derived climatic and vegetation variables to date generally adopted to model Grinnellian niches might also be useful in predicting spatial variations in dietary habits of populations, that is, their Eltonian niches.

AB As organisms shift their geographic distributions in response to climate change, biotic interactions have emerged as an important factor driving the rate and success of range expansions. Plant-microbe interactions are an understudied but potentially important factor governing plant range shifts. We studied the distribution and function of microbes present in high-elevation unvegetated soils, areas that plants are colonizing as climate warms, snow melts earlier, and the summer growing season lengthens. Using a manipulative snowpack and microbial inoculation transplant experiment, we tested the hypothesis that growing-season length and microbial community composition interact to control plant elevational range shifts. We predicted that a lengthening growing season combined with dispersal to patches of soils with more mutualistic microbes and fewer pathogenic microbes would facilitate plant survival and growth in previously unvegetated areas. We identified negative effects on survival of the common alpine bunchgrassDeschampsia cespitosain both short and long growing seasons, suggesting an optimal growing-season length for plant survival in this system that balances time for growth with soil moisture levels. Importantly, growing-season length and microbes interacted to affect plant survival and growth, such that microbial community composition increased in importance in suboptimal growing-season lengths. Further, plants grown with microbes from unvegetated soils grew as well or better than plants grown with microbes from vegetated soils. These results suggest that the rate and spatial extent of plant colonization of unvegetated soils in mountainous areas experiencing climate change could depend on both growing-season length and soil microbial community composition, with microbes potentially playing more important roles as growing seasons lengthen.

AB Mountaintop removal coal mining is the predominant form of surface mining in the Appalachian Region of the United States and leads to elevated levels of chemical constituents in streams draining mined watersheds. This data set contains measurements of water chemistry in the mountaintop mined landscape of Central Appalachia. These data were collected to determine the accumulation and transport of mercury (Hg) and selenium (Se) across environmental compartments in mountaintop mining-impacted waters as well as the impact of mountaintop mining on the aquatic-terrestrial subsidy. Samples were collected in summer 2017 and spring/summer 2018. Data predominantly include Se, THg, and methylmercury (MeHg) in the following environmental compartments at sites impacted and unimpacted by mountaintop removal coal mining: water, sediment, biofilm, larval cranefly, adult aquatic insects, and spiders. Additional water parameters that have been found to vary across a gradient of mountaintop mining impact (total organic carbon [TOC], total nitrogen [TN], sulfate [SO4], nitrate [NO3], chloride [Cl], pH, sodium [Na], potassium [K], magnesium [Mg], calcium [Ca], manganese [Mn], sulfur [S], specific conductance) were also measured. The majority of sites represented are headwater streams, although some settling ponds below valley fills are included. This data set also includes taxonomic characterization of the adult aquatic insect community as well as measurements of spider density at a subset of sites. There are no copyright restrictions; please cite this data paper when the data are used in publications.

AB Climate change is exposing high-latitude systems to warming and a shift towards more shrub-dominated plant communities, resulting in increased leaf-litter inputs at the soil surface, and more labile root-derived organic matter (OM) input in the soil profile. Labile OM can stimulate the mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM); a phenomenon termed "priming." In N-poor subarctic soils, it is hypothesized that microorganisms may "prime" SOM in order to acquire N (microbial N-mining). Increased leaf-litter inputs with a high C/N ratio might further exacerbate microbial N demand, and increase the susceptibility of N-poor soils to N-mining. We investigated the N-control of SOM mineralization by amending soils from climate change-simulation treatments in the subarctic (+1.1 degrees C warming, birch litter addition, willow litter addition, and fungal sporocarp addition) with labile OM either in the form of glucose (labile C; equivalent to 400 mu g C/g fresh [fwt] soil) or alanine (labile C + N; equivalent to 400 mu g C and 157 mu g N/g fwt soil), to simulate rhizosphere inputs. Surprisingly, we found that despite 5 yr of simulated climate change treatments, there were no significant effects of the field-treatments on microbial process rates, community structure or responses to labile OM. Glucose primed the mineralization of both C and N from SOM, but gross mineralization of N was stimulated more than that of C, suggesting that microbial SOM use increased in magnitude and shifted to components richer in N (i.e., selective microbial N-mining). The addition of alanine also resulted in priming of both C and N mineralization, but the N mineralization stimulated by alanine was greater than that stimulated by glucose, indicating strong N-mining even when a source of labile OM including N was supplied. Microbial carbon use efficiency was reduced in response to both labile OM inputs. Overall, these findings suggest that shrub expansion could fundamentally alter biogeochemical cycling in the subarctic, yielding more N available for plant uptake in these N-limited soils, thus driving positive plant-soil feedbacks.

AB Boreal forest and tundra biomes are key components of the Earth system because the mobilization of large carbon stocks and changes in energy balance could act as positive feedbacks to ongoing climate change. In Alaska, wildfire is a primary driver of ecosystem structure and function, and a key mechanism coupling high-latitude ecosystems to global climate. Paleoecological records reveal sensitivity of fire regimes to climatic and vegetation change over centennial-millennial time scales, highlighting increased burning concurrent with warming or elevated landscape flammability. To quantify spatiotemporal patterns in fire-regime variability, we synthesized 27 published sediment-charcoal records from four Alaskan ecoregions, and compared patterns to paleoclimate and paleovegetation records. Biomass burning and fire frequency increased significantly in boreal forest ecoregions with the expansion of black spruce, ca. 6,000-4,000 years before present (yr BP). Biomass burning also increased during warm periods, particularly in the Yukon Flats ecoregion from ca. 1,000 to 500 yr BP. Increases in biomass burning concurrent with constant fire return intervals suggest increases in average fire severity (i.e., more biomass burning per fire) during warm periods. Results also indicate increases in biomass burning over the last century across much of Alaska that exceed Holocene maxima, providing important context for ongoing change. Our analysis documents the sensitivity of fire activity to broad-scale environmental change, including climate warming and biome-scale shifts in vegetation. The lack of widespread, prolonged fire synchrony suggests regional heterogeneity limited simultaneous fire-regime change across our study areas during the Holocene. This finding implies broad-scale resilience of the boreal forest to extensive fire activity, but does not preclude novel responses to 21st-century changes. If projected increases in fire activity over the 21st century are realized, they would be unprecedented in the context of the last 8,000 yr or more.

AB Competition is a widespread interaction among carnivores, ultimately manifested through one or more dimensions of the species' ecological niche. One of the most explicit manifestations of competitive interactions regards spatial displacement. Its interpretation under a theoretical context provides an important tool to deepen our understanding of biological systems and communities, but also for wildlife management and conservation. We used Bayesian multispecies occupancy models on camera-trapping data from multiple sites in Southwestern Europe (SWE) to investigate competitive interactions within a carnivore guild, and to evaluate how species' ecological traits are shaping coexistence patterns. Seventeen out of 26 pairwise interactions departed from a hypothesis of independent occurrence, with spatial association being twice as frequent as avoidance. Association behaviors were only detected among mesocarnivores, while avoidance mainly involved mesocarnivores avoiding the apex predator (n = 4) and mesocarnivore-only interactions (n = 2). Body mass ratios, defined as the dominant over the subordinate species body mass, revealed an important negative effect ((beta) over cap=-0.38;CI95=-0.81to-0.06) on co-occurrence probability, and support that spatially explicit competitive interactions are mostly expressed by larger species able to dominate over smaller ones, with a threshold in body mass ratios of similar to 4, above which local-scale intraguild coexistence is unlikely. We found a weak relationship between pairwise trophic niche overlap and the probability of coexistence ((beta) over cap=-0.19;CI95=-0.58to0.21), suggesting that competition for feeding resources may not be a key driver of competition, at least at the scale of our analysis. Despite local-scale avoidance, regional-scale coexistence appears to be maintained by the spatial structuring of the competitive environment. We provide evidence that SWE ecosystems consist of spatially structured competitive environments, and propose that coexistence among near-sized species is likely achieved through the interplay of "facultative" and "behavioral" character displacements. Factors influencing carnivore coexistence likely include context-dependent density and trait-mediated effects, which should be carefully considered for a sound understanding of the mechanisms regulating these communities.

AB Plant-root-associated microbes influence plant phenotype and tolerance to environmental stress, and thus have been hypothesized to play a role in plant local adaptation. Here, we test this hypothesis with factorial experiments addressing the role of microbes in local adaptation of Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) to stressful limestone barrens (alvars) compared to neighboring old-fields. Alvar plants benefited more from microbes in early life history stages, while at later growth stages, alvar and old-field plants benefited equally from microbes but only in the old-field habitat. Patterns of local adaptation were changed by the presence of microbes. Alvar plants grown in association with alvar microbes outperformed old-field plants in the alvar habitat, whereas old-field plants showed patterns of maladaptation when grown with microbes. In this demonstration of microbe-mediated adaptation, we show that rhizosphere microbes can be important for plant fitness and patterns of local adaptation but that those effects are dependent on life-history stage and habitat.

AB Many studies have tried to assess the role of both deterministic and stochastic processes in community assembly, yet a lack of consensus exists on which processes are more prevalent and at which spatial scales they operate. To shed light on this issue, we tested two nonmutually exclusive, scale-dependent hypotheses: (1) that competitive exclusion dominates at small spatial scales; and (2) that environmental filtering does so at larger ones. To accomplish this, we studied the functional patterns of tropical montane forest communities along two altitudinal gradients, in Ecuador and Peru, using floristic and functional data from 60 plots of 0.1 ha. We found no evidence of either functional overdispersion or clustering at small spatial scales, but we did find functional clustering at larger ones. The observed pattern of clustering, consistent with an environmental filtering process, was more evident when maximizing the environmental differences among any pair of plots. To strengthen the link between the observed community functional pattern and the underlying process of environmental filtering, we explored differences in the climatic preferences of the most abundant species found at lower and higher elevations and examined whether their abundances shifted along the elevation gradient. We found (1) that greater community functional differences (observed between lower and upper tropical montane forest assemblies) were mostly the result of strong climatic preferences, maintained across the Neotropics; and (2) that the abundances of such species shifted along the elevational gradient. Our findings support the conclusion that, at large spatial scales, environmental filtering is the overriding mechanism for community assembly, because the pattern of functional clustering was linked to species' similarities in their climatic preferences, which ultimately resulted in shifts in species abundances along the gradient. However, there was no evidence of competitive exclusion at more homogeneous, smaller spatial scales, where plant species effectively compete for resources.

AB The Colombian Tropical Andes are one of the regions with highest bird diversity on Earth. However, information on bird morphology, reproductive phenology, and molt is particularly scarce in this region. Also, this region is heavily impacted by deforestation, and it is vulnerable to climate change. Hence, providing baseline information on life history and morphological traits will be essential to support future research on functional diversity, climate change effects, conservation, evolution, and phenology. To fill this gap, we have compiled information on bird distribution, morphology, molt, and reproductive phenology at 52 localities of the Department of Caldas, covering an elevation range between 148 and 3845 m. This compilation comprises a wide range of habitats, including native forests, forestry plantations, croplands, and paramo. Our database presents information for 3,398 records belonging to 379 bird species (representing 23 orders, 53 families, and 258 genera). From those records, 2,843 correspond to information collected in the field between 2008 and 2019, and the remaining 555 records correspond to specimens deposited in the Natural History Museum of the Caldas University, collected between 1969 and 2014. We measured nine morphological traits from all specimens: total culmen, gape, bill width, bill depth, tarsus, wing length, tail length, total length, and mass. We also have reproductive condition information for 257 species and molt information available for 378 species. The information contained in this data set represents 20% of the Colombian avifauna and 11% of the bird species richness in South America. This data set is released for non-commercial use only. Credits should be given to this paper (i.e., proper citation), and the products generated with this database should be shared under the same license terms (CC BY-NC-SA).

AB Robert MacArthur's niche theory makes explicit predictions on how community function should change over time in a competitive community. A key prediction is that succession progressively minimizes the energy wasted by a community, but this minimization is a trade-off between energy losses from unutilised resources and costs of maintenance. By predicting how competition determines community efficiency over time MacArthur's theory may inform on the impacts of disturbance on community function and invasion risk. We provide a rare test of this theory using phytoplankton communities, and find that older communities wasted less energy than younger ones but that the reduction in energy wastage was not monotonic over time. While community structure followed consistent and clear trajectories, community function was more idiosyncratic among adjoining successional stages and driven by total community biomass rather than species composition. Our results suggest that subtle shifts in successional sequence can alter community efficiency and these effects determine community function independently of individual species membership. We conclude that, at least in phytoplankton communities, general trends in community function are predictable over time accordingly to MacArthur's theory. Tests of MacArthur's minimization principle across very different systems should be a priority given the potential of this theory to inform on the functional properties of communities.

AB Relatively little is known about how plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) may affect plant growth in field conditions where factors such as herbivory may be important. Using a potted experiment in a grassland, we measured PSFs with and without aboveground insect herbivory for 20 plant species. We then compared PSF values to plant landscape abundance. Aboveground herbivory had a large negative effect on PSF values. For 15 of 20 species, PSFs were more negative with herbivory than without. This occurred because plant biomass on "home" soils was smaller with herbivory than without. PSF values with herbivory were correlated with plant landscape abundance, whereas PSF values without herbivory were not. Shoot nitrogen concentrations suggested that plants create soils that increase nitrogen uptake, but that greater shoot nitrogen values increase herbivory and that the net effect of positive PSF and greater aboveground herbivory is less aboveground biomass. Results provided clear evidence that PSFs alone have limited power in explaining species abundances and that herbivory has stronger effects on plant biomass and growth on the landscape. Our results provide a potential explanation for observed differences between greenhouse and field PSF experiments and suggest that PSF experiments need to consider important biotic interactions, like aboveground herbivory, particularly when the goal of PSF research is to understand plant growth in field conditions.

AB Ecological field experiments initiate successional and evolutionary changes among resident species, yet effect sizes are often reported as if they were constants. Few ecological studies have addressed their questions through long-term, experimental approaches, and many questions remain unanswered regarding temporal patterns in ecological effect sizes. We document temporal variation in effect sizes in response to pulse and press manipulations in a long-term factorial field experiment at Nash's Field, England. The experiment comprises seven treatments applied in a split-plot design to test the single and interactive effects of herbivory by insects, molluscs, and rabbits, liming, nutrient limitation (applied as press experiments), competition (exclusion of grasses or herbs with specific herbicides), and seed limitation (pulse experiments) on plant community dynamics. The response of all vascular plant species was followed for two decades. High species richness was positively related to the minus-grass herbicide in the first decade and negatively related to both nitrogen addition and the abundance of dominant species in both decades. Many significant effects appeared quickly, but some large effects were not detected until year 15. Press experiments produced some long-lasting effects, but effect sizes changed due to both idiosyncratic "year effects" and secular trends. For pulse experiments, most effects, including positive and negative responses to herbicide application and the invasion of most of the sown species, disappeared quickly. However, some endured or grew monotonically, such as the invasion of two sown species that benefited from particular combinations of the press treatments. The fastest effects to appear were the responses from established species. Many of these responses were negative, likely resulting from reduced niche dimensionality and competitive exclusion by new dominant species. Contrarily, one of the largest community-level effects took well over a decade to appear: the natural invasion by one species, which responded to a four-way interaction between experimental treatments. The insights gained from individual effects increased with the duration of the lag before their first appearance, drawing attention to the importance of long-term, manipulative field experiments. This experiment also reinforces the point that factorial experiments are the most insightful way to explore ecological interactions.

AB The functional trait values that constitute a whole-plant phenotype interact with the environment to determine demographic rates. Current approaches often fail to explicitly consider trait x trait and trait x environment interactions, which may lead to missed information that is valuable for understanding and predicting the drivers of demographic rates and functional diversity. Here, we consider these interactions by modeling growth performance landscapes that span multidimensional trait spaces along environmental gradients. We utilize individual-level leaf, stem, and root trait data combined with growth data from tree seedlings along soil nutrient and light gradients in a hyper-diverse tropical rainforest. We find that multiple trait combinations in phenotypic space (i.e., alternative designs) lead to multiple growth performance peaks that shift along light and soil axes such that no single or set of interacting traits consistently results in peak growth performance. Evidence from these growth performance peaks also generally indicates frequent independence of above- and belowground resource acquisition strategies. These results help explain how functional diversity is maintained in ecological communities and question the practice of utilizing a single trait or environmental variable, in isolation, to predict the growth performance of individual trees.

AB While work in temperate forests suggests that there are consistent differences in plant-soil feedback (PSF) between plants with arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal associations, it is unclear whether these differences exist in tropical rainforests. We tested the effects of mycorrhizal type, phylogenetic relationships to overstory species, and soil fertility on the growth of tree seedlings in a tropical Bornean rainforest with a high diversity of both ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal trees. We found that ectomycorrhizal tree seedlings had higher growth in soils conditioned by close relatives and that this was associated with higher mycorrhizal colonization. By contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal tree seedlings generally grew more poorly in soils conditioned by close relatives. For ectomycorrhizal species, the phylogenetic trend was insensitive to soil fertility. For arbuscular mycorrhizal seedlings, however, the effect of growing in soils conditioned by close relatives became increasingly negative as soil fertility increased. Our results demonstrate consistent effects of mycorrhizal type on plant-soil feedbacks across forest biomes. The positive effects of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis may help explain biogeographic variation across tropical forests, such as familial dominance of the Dipterocarpaceae in southeast Asia. However, positive feedbacks also raise questions about the role of PSFs in maintaining tropical diversity.

AB The role of tree diversity in restored forests and its impact on key ecological processes like growth and resistance to herbivory has become increasingly important. We analyzed height growth and white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus browsing damage to saplings of 16 broadleaved tree species in a large-scale (13 ha) reforestation experiment in Maryland, USA, where we manipulated tree diversity in 70 1,225-m(2) plots. After four growing seasons, higher plot-level tree richness led to increased deer browsing damage (i.e., associational susceptibility). Despite increased deer damage to saplings in mixed plots, tree richness had no overall effect on sapling height growth. However, diversity-height relationships were related to species functional traits. Light demanding species with large leaves and faster growth rates had reduced heights in mixtures, whereas shade-tolerant, slower-growing species generally had either increased or unchanged height growth in diverse tree communities, likely related to increased canopy closure in mixtures relative to monocultures. We show that tree diversity can improve growth of late successional species despite exacerbated mammalian herbivore damage. By facilitating the establishment of species with a range of life-history strategies, increased tree diversity may enhance ecosystem multi-functionality in the early stages of forest restoration.

AB A principal impact of invasive species is that they reduce local species richness. However, it is unknown whether the magnitude of the richness decrease has been consistent over the past two decades of published research. We used cumulative meta-analysis to synthesize evidence from 240 articles evaluating whether this cumulative evidence base generally supports, or refutes, the association between invasive species presence and richness declines. First, we determined whether evidence accumulation lowered the mean effect size of invasive species on local native richness through time; termed the "decline effect." Then, as mean effect sizes changed over time, we identified when accumulated evidence reached sufficiency, indicating that the mean effect direction (positive or negative) was unlikely to be reversed by unpublished research. We also assessed whether the mean effect size reached a threshold of stability over publication years. To date, no research has tested mechanisms of the decline effect, and here we determine whether publication bias, sample size, time since invasion, or invader trophic position are driving a decline effect in the published evidence base. We found a clear decline in the cumulative mean effect of invasive species on local native species richness as published evidence accumulated between 1999 and 2016. Despite this decline, an average negative association was stable and sufficiently robust to unpublished studies by 2007, showing a 21% mean richness decrease by 2016. Contrary to our expectation, the decline effect manifested consistently regardless of invasive species trophic position, time since invasion, or journal rank. Within taxonomic subgroups, trees, insects, and herbaceous plants exhibit a decline effect, yet still show sufficient and stable negative impacts on richness. However, many other taxonomic subgroups (e.g., crustaceans, fish, mammals) lack evidence for average negative impacts on richness, or have not met sufficiency or stability thresholds.

AB The Stress Gradient Hypothesis (SGH), which predicts increasing ratios of facilitative:competitive interactions with increasing stress, has long been a guiding framework for conceptualizing plant-plant interactions. Recently, there has been a growing recognition of the roles of microbes in mitigating or exacerbating environmental stress for their plant hosts. As such, we might predict, based on the SGH, that beneficial microbial effects on plant performance should be positively associated with stress. Specifically, we hypothesized that support for the SGH would depend on the host plant's habitat specialization such that species that specialize in high stress habitats and thus likely coevolved with the resident microbes would exhibit stronger support for the SGH than non-specialist plant species. We further hypothesized that support for the SGH would vary with germination frequency, since boosting germination of low-frequency germinators is one effective means by which microbes can benefit plant species performance. Here, we explore whether plant-microbial interactions support the SGH using 12 plant species native to the Florida rosemary scrub. We conducted factorial experiments that manipulated the presence of microbes in nine soils collected along an elevational stress gradient, and recorded germination frequency and biomass. Microbes increased the germination frequency of four species, all of which had relatively low germination rates. Furthermore, we found support for the SGH in nearly one-half of the species examined, with soil microbes facilitating germination with increasing stress for 5 of the 12 species tested, and none of the species exhibiting the opposite trend. Support for the SGH was not predicted by either the plant hosts' habitat specialization or germination frequency. In contrast to germination, biomass results showed little support for the SGH, with four of 12 species refuting and one species supporting SGH predictions. Taken together, our study documents that interactions between the soil microbial community and plant species along a stress gradient can support the SGH, but emphasizes that these effects are life-history-stage dependent. This work also identifies a common mechanism (germination facilitation) by which microbes can benefit plant species in stressful habitats.

AB Networks of direct and indirect biotic interactions underpin the complex dynamics and stability of ecological systems, yet experimental and theoretical studies often yield conflicting evidence regarding the direction (positive or negative) or magnitude of these interactions. We revisited pioneering data sets collected at the deciduous forested Horonai Stream and conducted ecosystem-level syntheses to demonstrate that the direction of direct and indirect interactions can change depending on the timescale of observation. Prior experimental studies showed that terrestrial prey that enter the stream from the adjacent forest caused positive indirect effects on aquatic invertebrates during summer by diverting fish consumption. Seasonal and annual estimates of secondary production and organic matter flows along food web pathways demonstrate that this seasonal input of terrestrial invertebrate prey increases production of certain fish species, reversing the indirect effect on aquatic invertebrates from positive at the seasonal timescale to negative at the annual timescale. Even though terrestrial invertebrate prey contributed 54% of the annual organic matter flux to fishes, primarily during summer, fish still consumed 98% of the aquatic invertebrate annual production, leading to top-down control that is not revealed in short-term experiments and demonstrating that aquatic prey may be a limiting resource for fishes. Changes in the direction or magnitude of interactions may be a key factor creating nonlinear or stabilizing feedbacks in complex systems, and these dynamics can be revealed by merging experimental and comparative approaches at different scales.

AB Most organisms reproduce in a dynamic environment, and life-history theory predicts that this can favor the evolution of strategies that capitalize on good times and avoid bad times. When offspring experience these environmental changes, fitness can depend strongly upon environmental conditions at birth and at later life stages. Consequently, fitness will be influenced by the reproductive decisions of parents (i.e., birth date effects) and developmental decisions (e.g., adaptive plasticity) of their offspring. We explored the consequences of these decisions using a highly iteroparous coral reef fish (the sixbar wrasse, Thalassoma hardwicke) and in a system where both parental and offspring environments vary with the lunar cycle. We tested the hypotheses that (1) reproductive patterns and offspring survival vary across the lunar cycle and (2) offspring exhibit adaptive plasticity in development time. We evaluated temporal variation in egg production from February to June 2017, and corresponding larval developmental histories (inferred from otolith microstructure) of successful settlers and surviving juveniles that were spawned during that same period. We documented lunar-cyclic variation in egg production (most eggs were spawned at the new moon). This pattern was at odds with the distribution of birth dates of settlers and surviving juveniles-most individuals that successfully survived to settlement and older stages were born during the full moon. Consequently, the probability of survival across the larval stage was greatest for offspring born close to the full moon, when egg production was at its lowest. Offspring also exhibited plasticity in developmental duration, adjusting their age at settlement to settle during darker portions of the lunar cycle than expected given their birth date. Offspring born near the new moon tended to be older and larger at settlement, and these traits conveyed a strong fitness advantage (i.e., a carryover effect) through to adulthood. We speculate that these effects (1) are shaped by a dynamic landscape of risk and reward determined by moonlight, which differentially influences adults and offspring, and (2) can explain the evolution of extreme iteroparity in sixbars.

AB Biodiversity loss is a hallmark of our times, but predicting its consequences is challenging. Ecological interactions form complex networks with multiple direct and indirect paths through which the impacts of an extinction may propagate. Here we show that accounting for these multiple paths connecting species is necessary to predict how extinctions affect the integrity of ecological networks. Using an approach initially developed for the study of information flow, we estimate indirect effects in plant-pollinator networks and find that even those species with several direct interactions may have much of their influence over others through long indirect paths. Next, we perform extinction simulations in those networks and show that although traditional connectivity metrics fail in the prediction of coextinction patterns, accounting for indirect interaction paths allows predicting species' vulnerability to the cascading effects of an extinction event. Embracing the structural complexity of ecological systems contributes towards a more predictive ecology, which is of paramount importance amid the current biodiversity crisis.

AB Ants are a widespread group of ecologically important insects. Therefore, ants that are important predators of other ants are likely to play key roles by changing the abundance and impacts of their prey. Familiar arthropod predators, like army ants, are known for their overwhelming raids on invertebrate prey but are limited to mostly tropical systems. Thief ants (Genus: Solenopsis Westwood) are a cosmopolitan group of mostly subterranean ants found in a wide variety of ecosystem types. They are known for their extremely small sizes and their specialized predation where they stealthily tunnel into the nests of other larger ant species to capture and consume only immature ants (larvae and pupae). Predation of ant colonies by other ants, and specialized predatory behaviors of presumed top ant predators (e.g., army ants) are well known. However long-term predation effects, such as across several seasons, are still poorly understood because of a lack of experimental studies. Here we report results of a similar to 1.5-year press field experiment where thief ants were reduced in natural ant communities. Potential impacts, such as predator-release, were quantified by sampling the co-occurring ant community. Compared to control plots, overall worker abundance and biomass increased where thief ants were reduced, and effects varied among ant species. Results suggest predator release as select aboveground foraging ant species increased in abundance and that thief ants may act as significant predators. Because thief ants are abundant and widespread, similar predatory effects may occur in many ant communities, and our understanding of important predators may need to adjust to include thieving species as well as army ants. Thief ants are very abundant, tiny, specialized to consume immature life stages, equipped with powerful venom, eusocial, and subterranean. This suite of adaptive traits seems unique to eusocial predators compared to animals, where "thieving" predators are usually larger in size compared to their adult-sized prey. Future work quantifying top-down regulation of prey and cascading consumptive and non-consumptive effects will help to understand thief ant predation and potential effects on ecosystem processes.

AB Predicting the dynamics of biotic communities is difficult because species' environmental responses are not independent, but covary due to shared or contrasting ecological strategies and the influence of species interactions. We used latent-variable joint species distribution models to analyze paired historical and contemporary inventories of 585 vascular plant species on 471 islands in the southwest Finnish archipelago. Larger, more heterogeneous islands were characterized by higher colonization rates and lower extinction rates. Ecological and taxonomical species groups explained small but detectable proportions of variance in species' environmental responses. To assess the potential influence of species interactions on community dynamics, we estimated species associations as species-to-species residual correlations for historical occurrences, for colorizations, and for extinctions. Historical species associations could to some extent predict joint colonization patterns, but the overall estimated influence of species associations on community dynamics was weak. These results illustrate the benefits of considering metacommunity dynamics within a joint framework, but also suggest that any influence of species interactions on community dynamics may be hard to detect from observational data.

AB The input of external energy and matter in recipient ecosystems can act as a bottom-up force that subsidizes consumers, with subsequent cascading effects throughout the food web. Depending on the amount of input, dietary preference, and the strength of trophic links, allochthonous resources generally play a stabilizing role on food webs. In this study, we investigated the stabilizing role of allochthonous aquatic resources on intraguild predation (IGP) and their consequences on shared prey in a terrestrial ecosystem. To this end, we manipulated the input of emergent aquatic insects (the allochthonous resources) from streams to land, and predation pressure by bats and birds (the top predators), in a multitrophic food web using an orthogonal exclusion experiment. Using stable isotope metrics, we found that bats, birds, and spiders (the mesopredators), were highly subsidized by emergent aquatic insects. Moreover, among terrestrial prey, top predators fed more on spiders than insects. As predicted, spiders were strongly affected by the presence of top predators when allochthonous resources were excluded. Consequently, in this scenario terrestrial insects were two times more abundant. Because spiders showed a higher preference for consuming aquatic resources, we suggest that nonconsumptive effects of spiders upon terrestrial insects could be mediating the strong response of those shared prey. We demonstrate that the input of allochthonous aquatic resources can play a fundamental role in stabilizing terrestrial trophic interactions and trophic cascades in riparian zones via decreasing predation pressure.

AB Soil phosphorus (P) availability in lowland tropical rainforests influences the distribution and growth of tropical tree species. Determining the P-acquisition strategies of tropical tree species could therefore yield insight into patterns of tree beta-diversity across edaphic gradients. In particular, the synthesis of root phosphatases is likely to be of significance given that organic P represents a large pool of potentially available P in tropical forest soils. It has also been suggested that a high root phosphatase activity in putative nitrogen (N) -fixing legumes might explain their high abundance in lowland neotropical forests under low P supply. Here, we measured phosphomonoesterase (PME) activity on the first three root orders of co-occurring tropical tree species differing in their N-fixation capacity, growing on soils of contrasting P availability in Panama. Our results show that root PME activity was higher on average in P-poor than in P-rich soils, but that local variation in PME activity among co-occurring species within a site was larger than that explained by differences in soil P across sites. Legumes expressed higher PME activity than nonlegumes, but nodulated legumes (i.e., actively fixing nitrogen) did not differ from legumes without nodules, indicating that PME activity is unrelated to N fixation. Finally, PME activity declined with increasing root order, but the magnitude of the decline varied markedly among species, highlighting the importance of classifying fine roots into functional groups prior to measuring root traits. Our results support the hypothesis that low-P promotes a high root PME activity, although the high local variation in this trait among co-occurring species points toward a high functional diversity in P-acquisition strategies within an individual community.

AB Behavioral niche partitioning is an important and widely assumed mechanism for the coexistence of ecologically similar species. Here we assessed this mechanism by testing its core assumption, that evolved differences in foraging behavior correspond with differences in resources consumed. We combined data on foraging behavior, available prey, and observed diets of five coexisting species of New World wood warblers (Parulidae), a system that has been foundational to our understanding of behavioral niche partitioning. Consistent with past work, we found that the five species differed markedly in their foraging behavior, enough that some species pairs hardly overlapped at all in foraging microhabitat. In contrast, the birds overlapped highly in diet, while exhibiting small, interpretable differences in resource use. The high overlap resulted mostly from all five species consuming numerous ants, a prey source that moves between microhabitats. To test the prediction that the large differences in foraging behavior explain the small dietary differences, we generated expected diets based on available prey and foraging microhabitat use. Consistent with niche partitioning as a coexistence mechanism, we found that the small dietary differences were explained by a combination of foraging microhabitat and available prey, but this pattern was driven by only a small number of prey taxa. Thus, we found mixed support for behavioral niche partitioning. Our results indicate that foraging behavior among these bird species helps explain subtle variation in diet, potentially facilitating coexistence. However, our results also revealed a weak relationship between foraging behavior and resource partitioning. Consequently, studies that rely solely on foraging behavior may greatly overestimate the degree of niche differentiation leading to erroneous conclusions. Overall, this study calls into question how and why these differences in foraging behavior evolved, and what role if any they play in facilitating coexistence.

AB Some invasive plant species rapidly evolve greater size and/or competitive ability in their nonnative ranges. However, it is not well known whether these traits transfer back to the native range, or instead represent genotype-by-environment interactions where traits are context specific to communities in the new range where the evolution occurred. Insight into transferability vs. context specificity can be tested using experiments performed with individuals from populations from the native and nonnative ranges of exotic invasive species. Using a widespread invasive plant species in Europe, Solidago gigantea, we established reciprocal common garden experiments in the native range (Montana, North America; n = 4) and the nonnative range (Hungary, Europe; n = 4) to assess differences in size, vegetative shoot number, and herbivory between populations from the native and nonnative ranges. In a greenhouse experiment, we also tested whether the inherent competitive ability of genotypes from 15 native and 15 invasive populations differed when pitted against 11 common native North American competitors. In common gardens, plants from both ranges considered together produced five times more biomass, grew four times taller, and developed five times more rhizomes in the nonnative range garden compared to the native range garden. The interaction between plant origin and the common garden location was highly significant, with plants from Hungary performing better than plants from Montana when grown in Hungary, and plants from Montana performing better than plants from Hungary when grown in Montana. In the greenhouse, there were no differences in the competitive effects and responses of S. gigantea plants from the two ranges when grown with North American natives. Our results suggest that S. gigantea might have undergone rapid evolution for greater performance abroad, but if so, this response does not translate to greater performance at home.

   IMPACTS; GROWTH; RATES
AB In consumer communities, intra-guild predation (IGP) is a commonly observed interaction that is widely believed to increase resource density. However, some recent theoretical work predicts that resource density should first decrease, and then increase as the strength of IGP increases. This occurs because weak to intermediate IGP increases the IG predator density more than it reduces the IG prey density, so that weak to intermediate IGP leads to the lowest resource density compared to weak or strong IGP. We test this prediction that basal resource density would first decrease and then increase as the strength of IGP increase. We used a well-studied system with two protozoa species engaged in IGP and three bacteria species as the basal resources. We experimentally manipulated the percentage of the IG prey population that was available to an IG predator as a proxy for IGP strength. We found that bacterial density first decreased (by similar to 25%) and then increased (by similar to 30%) as the strength of IGP increased. Using a modified version of a published IGP model, we were able to explain similar to 70% of the variation in protozoa and bacterial density. Agreement of the empirical results with model predictions suggests that IGP first increased the IG predator density by consuming a small proportion of the IG prey population, which in turn increased the summed consumer density and decreased the bacterial resource density. As IGP strength increased further, the IG predator became satiated by the IG prey, which then freed the bacterial resource from predation and thus increased bacterial density. Consequently, our work shows that IGP can indeed decrease or increase basal resource density depending on its strength. Consequently, the impacts of IGP on resource density is potentially more complex than previously thought.

AB Recent observations have found plant-species-specific fly-host selection (i.e., specialization) of wasp parasitoids (wasps) in plant-fly-wasp (P-F-W) tripartite networks, yet no study has explored the dynamical implications of such high-order specialization for the persistence of this network. Here we develop a patch-dynamic framework for a unique P-F-W tripartite network with specialization observed in eastern Tibetan Plateau and explore its metacommunity robustness to habitat loss. We show that specialization in parasitoidism promotes fly species diversity, while the richness of both plant and wasp decreases. Compared to other two null models, real network structure favors plant species coexistence but increases the extinction risk for both flies and wasps. However, these effects of specialization and network structure would be weakened and ultimately disappear with increasing habitat loss. Interestingly, intermediate levels of habitat loss can maximize the diversity of flies and wasps, while increasing or decreasing habitat loss results in more species losses, supporting intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Finally, we observe that high levels of habitat loss initiate a bottom-up cascade of species extinction from plants to both flies and wasps, resulting in a rapid collapse of the whole tripartite networks. Overall, this theoretical framework is the first attempt to characterize the dynamics of whole tripartite metacommunities interacting in realistic high-order ways, offering new insights into complex multipartite networks.

AB Spatial variation in the occurrence of browsing ungulates can drive local adaptation in plant traits but also lead to trade-offs among traits potentially enhancing competitive ability versus resistance or tolerance to browsing. Plectritis congesta populations co-occurring on islands with and without ungulates offer striking examples of population-level variation in traits, such as plant height and fruit morphology, which may also affect fitness. We monitored split-plot common gardens exposed to and protected from browsing ungulates for 5 yr to test for local adaptation (local vs. foreign comparison) in P. congesta by comparing the survival and fecundity of 4,392 sown fruits from six island populations where ungulates were present ("historically exposed") and six where they were absent ("historically naive"). Our results indicate that local adaptation to browsing in P. congesta favored rosette formation, delayed flowering, reduced height, and the production of wingless fruits, all of which appeared to enhance survival, fecundity, and population growth in plants from populations historically exposed to ungulate browsers, as compared to plants from historically naive populations. In contrast, plants from historically naive populations displayed higher relative fitness in the absence of ungulates, increased in height, flowered earlier, and produced fewer but larger, winged fruits, often in large terminal inflorescences. Our results support the hypothesis that variation in the occurrence of ungulate browsers has led to (1) spatial heterogeneity in natural selection and rapid adaptation in P. congesta populations on islands, and (2) context-dependent trade-offs in the fitness value of traits linked to the resistance or tolerance of browsing versus success in competition for light, pollinators, or other resources. Because patterns of selection in plant communities will vary with the introduction or extirpation of top predators or browsers, we suggest historical context, local adaptation, and the capacity for rapid adaptation should be a focal concern of those aiming to maximize or predict population persistence under environmental change in conservation plans.

AB Despite the recent advances in seed science research, information on seed dormancy and germination traits is still missing for many lineages of the seed plants. We translated and digitized a huge data set on seed dormancy and germination from the Reference Book On Dormant Seed Germination by M. Nikolaeva, M. Razumova, and V. Gladkova published in Russian in 1985 and previously not readily accessible to the great majority of people in the international scientific community interested in seeds. The data set contains information on the seed dormancy classification (sensu Nikolaeva et al., 1985; Baskin and Baskin, 2004), dormancy-breaking conditions/germination, and for some of the included species storage behaviour, of seeds of nearly 3000 gymnosperm and angiosperm species from 843 genera and 164 families occurring worldwide. Additionally, the data set contains about 550 references, many of them unknown to seed scientists, to seed ecology research conducted between 1926 and 1985. The data set should be of value to applied, basic, and theoretical plant biologists, ecologists, and evolutionary biologists interested in the various aspects of regeneration of plants from seeds. There are no copyright or proprietary restrictions for research or teaching purposes. The originator of the data would appreciate notification when and how the data are used. When used in published analyses, this paper should be referred to as the data source.

AB By regulating populations of herbivores, predators can indirectly influence plant production. However, the factors influencing the strength of this type of trophic cascade are still unclear. We hypothesized that changes to plant community structure would affect the number of avian predators, thereby mediating cascade strength. Using a 4-yr, blocked, split-plot experiment, we independently manipulated both predators (birds) and plants in an early seral managed forest system in western Oregon, USA, and measured abundance across three trophic levels. We applied herbicides, as a surrogate for land-use intensification, to recently clear-cut stands to establish an experimental gradient in plant abundance and species richness, and excluded birds using 28, 225 m(2) exclosures. In total, we counted and identified 94,738 arthropods of 141 families in paired control and bird exclosure plots. On average, insectivorous birds reduced arthropod abundance by 16% and plant damage by 14%, and some well-known pests (e.g., Adelges cooleyi) of crop trees (mostly Pseudotsuga menziesii) in our system were reduced by as much as 30%. However, this effect did not translate into a trophic cascade that increased crop-tree growth in the presence of birds. We experimentally reduced plant abundance and diversity by 67% and 55%, respectively, in the most intensive herbicide treatment in relation to untreated controls, but reduced vegetative resources did not change the strength of the direct effect of birds on arthropods or the indirect effect of birds on plants.

AB Competition among trees is an important driver of community structure and dynamics in tropical forests. Neighboring trees may impact an individual tree's growth rate and probability of mortality, but large-scale geographic and environmental variation in these competitive effects has yet to be evaluated across the tropical forest biome. We quantified effects of competition on tree-level basal area growth and mortality for trees >= 10-cm diameter across 151 similar to 1-ha plots in mature tropical forests in Amazonia and tropical Africa by developing nonlinear models that accounted for wood density, tree size, and neighborhood crowding. Using these models, we assessed how water availability (i.e., climatic water deficit) and soil fertility influenced the predicted plot-level strength of competition (i.e., the extent to which growth is reduced, or mortality is increased, by competition across all individual trees). On both continents, tree basal area growth decreased with wood density and increased with tree size. Growth decreased with neighborhood crowding, which suggests that competition is important. Tree mortality decreased with wood density and generally increased with tree size, but was apparently unaffected by neighborhood crowding. Across plots, variation in the plot-level strength of competition was most strongly related to plot basal area (i.e., the sum of the basal area of all trees in a plot), with greater reductions in growth occurring in forests with high basal area, but in Amazonia, the strength of competition also varied with plot-level wood density. In Amazonia, the strength of competition increased with water availability because of the greater basal area of wetter forests, but was only weakly related to soil fertility. In Africa, competition was weakly related to soil fertility and invariant across the shorter water availability gradient. Overall, our results suggest that competition influences the structure and dynamics of tropical forests primarily through effects on individual tree growth rather than mortality and that the strength of competition largely depends on environment-mediated variation in basal area.

AB Ecological drift can override the effects of deterministic niche selection on small populations and drive the assembly of some ecological communities. We tested this hypothesis with a unique data set sampled identically in 200 streams in two regions (tropical Brazil and boreal Finland) that differ in macroinvertebrate community size by fivefold. Null models allowed us to estimate the magnitude to which beta-diversity deviates from the expectation under a random assembly process while taking differences in richness and relative abundance into account, i.e., beta-deviation. We found that both abundance- and incidence-based beta-diversity was negatively related to community size only in Brazil. Also, beta-diversity of small tropical communities was closer to stochastic expectations compared with beta-diversity of large communities. We suggest that ecological drift may drive variation in some small communities by changing the expected outcome of niche selection, increasing the chances of species with low abundance and narrow distribution to occur in some communities. Habitat destruction, overexploitation, pollution, and reductions in connectivity have been reducing the size of biological communities. These environmental pressures might make smaller communities more vulnerable to novel conditions and render community dynamics more unpredictable. Incorporation of community size into ecological models should provide conceptual and applied insights into a better understanding of the processes driving biodiversity.

AB Top-down and bottom-up controls regulate the structure and stability of ecosystems, but their relative roles in terrestrial systems have been debated. Here we studied a hydro-inundated land-bridge system in subtropical China and tested the relative importance of these two controls in determining the rodent-mediated regeneration of a locally dominant tree species. Our results showed that both controls operated in terrestrial habitats and that their relative importance switched as habitat size changed. Habitat loss initially removed predators of rodents that released rodent populations and triggered massive seed predation (top-down control), leading to reduced seedling establishment. A further reduction in habitat size led to decrease in rodent population that was supposed to increase seedling survival of the tree species, but the decline in habitat size deteriorated the abiotic environments (bottom-up control) that severely prevented seedling recruitment. As the ongoing global land use change is creating increasing number of small-sized forest fragments, our findings provide novel insights into the restoration of seriously fragmented forests.

AB Documenting which species interact within ecological communities is challenging and labor intensive. As a result, many interactions remain unrecorded, potentially distorting our understanding of network structure and dynamics. We test the utility of four structural models and a new coverage-deficit model for predicting missing links in both simulated and empirical bipartite networks. We find they can perform well, although the predictive power of structural models varies with the underlying network structure. The accuracy of predictions can be improved by ensembling multiple models. Augmenting observed networks with most-likely missing links improves estimates of qualitative network metrics. Tools to identify likely missing links can be simple to implement, allowing the prioritization of research effort and more robust assessment of network properties.

AB Grasslands worldwide are expected to experience an increase in extreme events such as drought, along with simultaneous increases in mineral nutrient inputs as a result of human industrial activities. These changes are likely to interact because elevated nutrient inputs may alter plant diversity and increase the sensitivity to droughts. Dividing a system's sensitivity to drought into resistance to change during the drought and rate of recovery after the drought generates insights into different dimensions of the system's resilience in the face of drought. Here, we examine the effects of experimental nutrient fertilization and the resulting diversity loss on the resistance to and recovery from severe regional droughts. We do this at 13 North American sites spanning gradients of aridity, five annual grasslands in California, and eight perennial grasslands in the Great Plains. We measured rate of resistance as the change in annual aboveground biomass (ANPP) per unit change in growing season precipitation as conditions declined from normal to drought. We measured recovery as the change in ANPP during the postdrought period and the return to normal precipitation. Resistance and recovery did not vary across the 400-mm range of mean growing season precipitation spanned by our sites in the Great Plains. However, chronic nutrient fertilization in the Great Plains reduced drought resistance and increased drought recovery. In the California annual grasslands, arid sites had a greater recovery postdrought than mesic sites, and nutrient addition had no consistent effects on resistance or recovery. Across all study sites, we found that predrought species richness in natural grasslands was not consistently associated with rates of resistance to or recovery from the drought, in contrast to earlier findings from experimentally assembled grassland communities. Taken together, these results suggest that human-induced eutrophication may destabilize grassland primary production, but the effects of this may vary across regions and flora, especially between perennial and annual-dominated grasslands.

AB Why some species become invasive while others do not remains an elusive question. It has been proposed that invasive species should depend less on mutualisms, because their spread would then be less constrained by the availability of mutualistic partners. We tested this idea with the genus Pinus, whose degree of invasiveness is known at the species level (being highly and negatively correlated with seed size), and which forms obligate mutualistic associations with ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF). Mycorrhizal dependence is defined as the degree to which a plant needs the mycorrhizal fungi to show the maximum growth. In this regard, we use plant growth response to mycorrhizal fungi as a proxy for mycorrhizal dependence. We assessed the responsiveness of Pinus species to EMF using 1,206 contrasts published on 34 species, and matched these data with data on Pinus species invasiveness. Surprisingly, we found that species that are more invasive depend more on mutualisms (EMF). Seedling growth of species with smaller seeds benefited more from mutualisms, indicating a higher dependence. A higher reliance on EMF could be part of a strategy in which small-seeded species produce more seeds that can disperse further, and these species are likely to establish only if facilitated by mycorrhizal fungi. On the contrary, big-seeded species showed a lower dependence on EMF, which may be explained by their tolerance to stressful conditions during establishment. However, the limited dispersal of larger seeds may limit the spread of these species. We present strong evidence against a venerable belief in ecology that species that rely more on mutualisms are less prone to invade, and suggest that in certain circumstances greater reliance on mutualists can increase spread capacity.

AB Plant growth is often co-limited by nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Plants might use one element to acquire another (i.e., trading N for P and P for N), which potentially explains synergistic growth responses to NP addition. We studied a 66-yr-old grassland experiment in South Africa that consists of four levels of N addition with and without P addition. We investigated the response of aboveground net primary production (ANPP) to N and P addition over the last 66 yr. Further, we tested whether phosphatase activity and plant P uptake depend on N availability, and vice versa, whether non-symbiotic N-2 fixation and plant N uptake depend on P availability. We expected that the interaction of both elements promote processes of nutrient acquisition and contribute to synergistic plant growth effects in response to NP addition. We found synergistic N and P co-limitation of ANPP for the period from 1951 to 2017 but the response to N and P addition diminished over time. In 2017, aboveground P stocks, relative rRNA operon abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and soil organic P storage increased with N fertilization rate when N was added with P compared to the treatment in which only N was added. Further, N addition increased phosphatase activity, which indicates that plants used N to acquire P from organic sources. In contrast, aboveground N stocks and non-symbiotic N-2 fixation did not change significantly due to P addition. Taken together, our results indicate that trading N for P likely contributes to synergistic plant-growth response. Plants used added N to mobilize and take up P from organic sources, inducing stronger recycling of P and making the plant community less sensitive to external nutrient inputs. The latter could explain why indications of synergistic co-limitation diminished over time, which is usually overlooked in short-term nutrient addition experiments.

AB We took advantage of two natural experiments to investigate processes that regulate tree recruitment in gaps. In the first, we examined the recruitment of small and large saplings and trees into 31 gaps resulting from treefalls occurring between 1984 and 2015 in the 2.25-ha core area of a 4-ha tree plot at Cocha Cashu in Peru. In the second, we identified the tallest saplings recruiting into 69 gaps created during a violent wind storm in February 2000. In the established tree plot, we were able to compare the composition of saplings in the disturbance zones of gaps prior to, during, and subsequent to the period of gap formation. Recruitment in gaps was compared with that in "nofall" zones, areas within the plot that had not experienced a treefall at least since the early 1980s. Our results confirmed earlier findings that a consistently high proportion (~60%) of established saplings survived gap formation. Light demanding species, as proxied by mortality rates, recruited under all conditions, but preferentially during periods of gap formation, a pattern that was especially strong among gap pioneers. Similar results were noted, separately, for small and large saplings and trees recruiting at >= 10 cm dbh. One hundred percent of previously untagged trees recruiting into gaps in the first post-disturbance census were gap pioneers, suggesting rapid development. This conclusion was strongly supported in a follow-up survey taken of 69 gaps 19 months after they had been synchronously created in a wind storm. Ten species of gap pioneers, eight of which are not normally present in the advance regeneration, had attained heights of 6-10 m in 19 months. The 10 gap pioneers were dispersed, variously, by primates, bats, birds, and wind and reached maximum frequency in different-sized gaps (range 1,000 m(2)). Both gap size and limited dispersal of zoochorous species into gaps serve as filters for establishment, creating a complex mosaic of conditions that enhances species diversity.

AB The term rheophyte describes a biological group of flood-tolerant plants that are confined to the beds of swift-running streams and rivers in nature and grow up to flood level, but not beyond the reach of regularly occurring flash floods. Although over 35 yr have passed since the first global census of rheophytes, no updates have been recorded regarding the number of taxa in this biological group in seed plants. Therefore, the present work aimed to (1) review the main topics associated with rheophytism (e.g., morphological characteristics, genetic studies, geographic distribution, conservation, and evolutionary aspects); (2) provide an updated checklist of rheophytes distributed around the world considering the two main groups in seed plants (gymnosperms and angiosperms); (3) demonstrate the distribution of rheophytism in the angiosperm phylogeny; and (4) estimate the geographical distribution and richness of selected taxa on the world map for the first time. All data compiled for the present study originated from a search of peer-reviewed articles, secondary literature (theses, dissertations, reports, books, and floras), and electronic facilities. We compiled a data set composed of four taxa in gymnosperms (Podocarpaceae family) and 1,368 taxa (including obligate, facultative, and unclassified rheophytes) distributed in 114 families and 508 genera in angiosperms. Most of the studied taxa belong to eudicotyledons (72.81%), while 1.46% belong to magnoliids, and 25.73% belong to monocotyledons. The families with the highest number of taxa in descending order are Podostemaceae, Araceae, Myrtaceae, Rubiaceae, Asteraceae, Apocynaceae, Arecaceae, Fabaceae, Phyllanthaceae, and Poaceae. Of the 114 families plotted in angiosperm phylogeny, at least 80 harbor obligate rheophytes. The geographical distribution of rheophytes in angiosperms, as expected based on the first census of this biological group, is mainly in the tropical and subtropical regions. The high richness of rheophytic taxa was mostly found in southern Mexico, southern China, Borneo, and northern and eastern Australia. In contrast, the geographical distribution of rheophytes in gymnosperms is restricted to New Caledonia and Tasmania. The present study will help to advance knowledge regarding the diversity of rheophytes in angiosperms and gymnosperms while drawing attention to this biological group, which has often been overlooked.

AB Analyses of heat tolerance in insects often suggest that this trait is relatively invariant, leading to the use of fixed thermal maxima in models predicting future distribution of species in a warming world. Seasonal environments expose populations to a wide annual temperature variation. To evaluate the simplifying assumption of invariant thermal maxima, we quantified heat tolerance of 26 ant species across three seasons that vary two-fold in mean temperature. Our ultimate goal was to test the hypothesis that heat tolerance tracks monthly temperature. Ant foragers tested at the end of the summer, in September, had higher average critical thermal maximum (CTmax) compared to those in March and December. Four out of five seasonal generalists, species actively foraging in all three focal months, had, on average, 6 degrees C higher CTmax in September. The invasive fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, was among the thermally plastic species, but the native thermal specialists still maintained higher CTmax than S. invicta. Our study shows that heat tolerance can be plastic, and this should be considered when examining species-level adaptations. Moreover, the plasticity of thermal traits, while potentially costly, may also generate a competitive advantage over species with fixed traits and promote resilience to climate change.

AB Arthropod abundance and diversity often track plant biomass and diversity at the local scale. However, under altered precipitation regimes and anthropogenic disturbances, plant-arthropod relationships are expected to be increasingly controlled by abiotic, rather than biotic, factors. We used an experimental precipitation gradient combined with human management in a temperate mixed-grass prairie to examine (1) how two drivers, altered precipitation and biomass removal, can synergistically affect abiotic factors and plant communities and (2) how these effects can cascade upward, impacting the arthropod food web. Both drought and hay harvest increased soil surface temperature, and drought decreased soil moisture. Arthropod abundance decreased with low soil moisture and, contrary to our predictions, decreased with increased plant biomass. Arthropod diversity increased with soil moisture, decreased with high surface temperatures, and tracked arthropod abundance but was unaffected by plant diversity or quality. Our experiment demonstrates that arthropod abundance is directly constrained by abiotic factors and plant biomass, in turn constraining local arthropod diversity. If robust, this result suggests climate change in the southern Great Plains may directly reduce arthropod diversity.

AB The diversity of primary producers strongly affects the structure and diversity of species assemblages at other trophic levels. However, limited knowledge exists of how plant diversity effects at small spatial scales propagate to consumer communities at larger spatial scales. We assessed arthropod community beta and gamma-diversity in response to experimentally manipulated plant community richness in two long-term grassland biodiversity experiments (Jena, Germany and Cedar Creek, USA) replicated over two years. We calculated arthropod species turnover among all plot combinations (beta-diversity), and accumulated number of arthropod species occurring on (1) all pairwise plot combinations and (2) 40 randomly selected six-plot combinations (gamma-diversity). The components of arthropod diversity were tested against two measures of plant diversity, namely average plant alpha-diversity (PSR over bar ) and the average difference in plant alpha-diversity between plots (Delta PSR). Whereas PSR over bar points to the overall importance of plant alpha-diversity for arthropod community turnover and diversity on a larger scale, Delta PSR represents the role of habitat heterogeneity. We demonstrate that arthropod gamma-diversity is supported by high, homogeneous plant alpha-diversity, despite lower arthropod beta-diversity among high- compared to low-diversity plant communities. We also show that, in six-plot combinations, average plant alpha-diversity has a positive influence on arthropod gamma-diversity only when homogeneity in plant alpha-diversity is also high. Varying heterogeneity in six-plot combinations showed that combinations consisting solely of plots with an intermediate level of plant alpha-diversity support a higher number of arthropod species compared to combinations that contain a mix of high- and low-diversity plots. In fact, equal levels of arthropod diversity were found for six-plot combinations with only intermediate or high plant alpha-diversity, due to saturating benefits of local and larger-scale plant diversity for higher trophic levels. Our results, alongside those of recent observational studies, strongly suggest that maintaining high alpha-diversity in plant communities is important for conserving multiple components of arthropod diversity. As arthropods carry out a range of essential ecosystem functions, such as pollination and natural pest-control, our findings provide crucial insight for effective planning of human-dominated landscapes to maximize both ecological and economic benefits in grassland systems.

AB Ecological communities are dynamic entities subjected to extinction/colonization events. Because species are connected through complex interaction networks, the arrival of a new species is likely to affect various species across the community, as observed in plant biological invasions. However, plant invasions usually represent extreme scenarios in which the community is strongly dominated by the alien species, confounding the effects of a change in species composition with a massive increase in floral resource availability. Our study addresses changes in plant community composition involving native species, a common phenomenon under the current climate change scenario in which plants are modifying their distribution ranges. We experimentally manipulated patches of a natural scrubland community by introducing a native plant (henceforth colonizing plant). To avoid introducing a disproportionate amount of floral resources we adjusted the number of flowers of the colonizing plant to the amount of floral resources locally available in each patch. We had two objectives: (1) to analyse the effects of the arrival of a new plant on the pollinator community, the rearrangement of plant-pollinator interactions and the structure of the plant-pollinator network; (2) to evaluate potential consequences for pollination and the reproductive success of resident plant species. The colonizing plant acted as a magnet species, attracting bumble bees and facilitating interactions to other plants through spill-over. The introduction of the colonizing plant also affected the structure of plant-pollinator networks (colonized networks were more generalized and more nested than control networks) and modified the arrangement of plant and pollinator species into modules. Ultimately, these changes resulted in higher heterospecific (but not conspecific) pollen deposition and had contrasting effects on the reproductive success of two resident plant species (higher fruit set and lower seed set, respectively). Our study shows that relationships between plants and pollinators are rapidly rearranged in response to novel situations (even when the new plant is not overly dominant), with important functional consequences on pollination and plant reproductive success. Our study establishes a link between network structure and pollination and plant reproductive success, which may be mediated by differences among pollinator species in foraging behavior.

AB Although the asymmetry of species linkage within ecological networks is now well recognized, its effect on communities has scarcely been empirically investigated. Based on theory, we predicted that an asymmetric architecture of antagonistic plant-herbivore networks would emerge at the community level and that this asymmetry would negatively affect community-common plants more than rare ones. We tested this prediction by analyzing the architectural properties of an alpine plant and pre-dispersal seed-predator network and its effect on seed loss rate of plants in the Tibetan Plateau. This network showed an asymmetric architecture, where the common plant species (with a larger aboveground biomass per area) were infested by a higher number of predator species. Moreover, they asymmetrically interacted with specialized herbivores, presumably because of greater seed resource abundance. In turn, the asymmetric interactions led to a higher proportion of seed loss in the common plants at the species level. Our results suggest that asymmetric antagonistic networks may improve species coexistence by contributing to a mechanism of rare-species advantage.

AB Pollen data are widely used to reconstruct past climate changes, using relationships between modern pollen abundance in surface samples and climate at the surface-sample sites as a calibration. Visualization of modern pollen data in multidimensional climate space provides a way to establish that taxon abundances are well behaved before using them in climate reconstructions. Visualization is also helpful for ecological interpretation of variations in pollen abundance in space and time. Here, we present Generalized Additive Models for the distribution of 195 European pollen and pteridophyte spore taxa in a bioclimate space defined by seasonal temperatures (as mean temperature of the coldest month and annual growing degree days) and an annual moisture index. These models can be used to explore the realized climate niche of pollen taxa and to build statistical models for palaeoclimate reconstruction.

ID CANNIBALISM; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; STAGE; SIZE
AB Function and abundances shape species interactions and thus ecological communities. While communities are often summarized as the mean function of each species, intraspecific variation in traits and thus function is an important driver of community composition. Ontogeny is a common source of intraspecific variation, but while age-related functional changes can alter species interactions, so too can the effects of those functions on the density of the focal organism. For instance, ontogenetic variation can trigger higher levels of cannibalism, reducing abundances and altering interspecific interactions. I manipulate ontogenetic variation in damselfly larvae to show that intraspecific variation can impact communities through two distinct mechanisms. First, within-species differences affect population sizes, and thus indirectly shape communities (indirect effect). In particular, ontogenetic variation resulted in smaller damselfly populations, likely because of increased cannibalism rates, and thus ontogenetically diverse populations had a smaller total effect on their prey. Second, trait variation can affect communities by creating differences in the strength of per capita species interactions (direct effect). In this case, damselfly populations with greater age variation had smaller per capita effects on prey communities. I conclude that ontogeny of a single species can directly and indirectly shape community composition.

   IMPACT
AB Traditional approaches in trait-based community ecology typically expect that trait filtering across broad environmental gradients is largely due to replacement of species, rather than intraspecific trait adjustments. Recently, the role of intraspecific trait variability has been largely highlighted as an important contributor mediating the ability of communities to persist under changing conditions and determining the community-level trait variation, particularly across limited environmental gradients. Unfortunately, few studies quantify the relative importance of species turnover versus intraspecific variability mediating the response of communities different from vascular plants. Here, we studied the functional changes in epiphytic lichen communities within 23 beech forests across large latitudinal (ca. 3,000 km) and environmental gradients in Europe to quantify the relative contribution of species turnover and intraspecific variability and the role of climate controlling community-level trait changes. For 58 lichen species, we focused on a set of 10 quantitative functional traits potentially affected by climatic conditions and related to photosynthetic performance (n = 1,184 thalli), water use strategy (n = 1,018 thalli), and nutrient uptake (n = 1,179 thalli). Our results showed that intraspecific trait variability explained most of the functional changes in lichen communities in response to the latitudinal gradient. Further, such functional changes were determined by the covariation between intraspecific trait variability and species turnover, which varied in sign depending on the trait considered. Finally, different climatic predictors explained functional variation due to both intraspecific trait variability and species turnover. We propose that lichen communities cope with contrasting climatic conditions by adjusting the functional trait values of the most abundant species within the communities rather than by the replacement of the species. Consequently, intraspecific variability should be explicitly incorporated to understand the effect of environmental changes on lichen communities, even over large environmental variations, better. Our results challenge the universality of the hypothesis that species turnover chiefly drives functional trait changes across large environmental gradients and call for a wider test of such important assumptions in trait ecology in different organism types and ecosystems.

AB Grasses accumulate high concentrations of silicon (Si) in their tissues, with potential benefits including herbivore defense, improved water balance, and reduced leaf construction costs. Although Si is one of the most widely varying leaf constituents among individuals, species, and ecosystems, the environmental forces driving this variation remain elusive and understudied. To understand relationships between environmental factors and grass Si accumulation better, we analyzed foliar chemistry of grasses from 17 globally distributed sites where nutrient inputs and grazing were manipulated. These sites span natural gradients in temperature, precipitation, and underlying soil properties, which allowed us to assess the relative importance of soil moisture and nutrients across variation in climate. Foliar Si concentration did not respond to large mammalian grazer exclusion, but significant variation in herbivore abundance among sites may have precluded the observation of defoliation effects at these sites. However, nutrient addition consistently reduced leaf Si, especially at sites with low soil nitrogen prior to nutrient addition. Additionally, a leaf-level trade-off between Si and carbon (C) existed that was stronger at arid sites than mesic sites. Our results suggest soil nutrient limitation favors investment in Si over C-based leaf construction, and that fixing C is especially costly relative to assimilating Si when water is limiting. Our results demonstrate the importance of soil nutrients and precipitation as key drivers of global grass silicification patterns.

AB Individual variation in reproductive ability is a key component of natural selection within populations, driving the evolution of life histories and population responses to changing environmental conditions. Evidence that population density affects individual-level fitness in wild populations is limited, particularly for long-lived animals, which are difficult to observe on a biologically relevant scale. We tested for individual heterogeneity in reproductive performance in female grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) using 35 yr of mark-resighting data at Sable Island, Canada (43.93 degrees N 59.91 degrees W). We used Bayesian generalized linear mixed-effect models and multistate open robust design mark-resight models to investigate whether population size negatively influences individual reproductive performance. We measured reproductive performance in two ways: reproductive frequency (the probability of returning to the island to breed) and annual provisioning performance (the probability of successfully weaning a pup given a female bred). Sighting histories of 1,655 known-aged females with a total of 22,961 pupping events were used for analysis. After accounting for effects of female age, parity, and random year effects, we found that both provisioning performance and reproductive frequency demonstrated a strong, positive correlation with population size. Among-individual variance in reproductive traits and responses to population size indicated considerable heterogeneity in overall reproductive performance. As population size grew, "robust" females increased their reproductive performance more than their more "frail" conspecifics in both reproductive traits, resulting in an amplification of differences among individuals. Consequently, simulations from posterior distributions revealed a large fitness consequence of heterogeneity in this population, with "frail" individuals having 47.1% fewer successful pups than more "robust" females (mean reproductive output +/- SD: 9.12 +/- 3.77 pups for frail individuals, 16.97 +/- 2.94 for robust individuals). Repeatability of overall reproductive performance across environments indicates individual quality may be more influential to lifetime reproductive success than costs associated with reproductive investment. This quantification of relative fitness and its dynamics is crucial to understanding broad evolutionary processes in natural populations.

AB Global change includes invasion by exotic (nonnative) plant species and altered precipitation patterns, and these factors may affect terrestrial carbon (C) storage. We measured soil C changes in experimental mixtures of all exotic or all native grassland plant species under two levels of summer drought stress (0 and +128 mm). After 8 yr, soils were sampled in 10-cm increments to 100-cm depth to determine if soil C differed among treatments in deeper soils. Total soil C (organic + inorganic) content was significantly higher under native than exotic plantings, and differences increased with depth. Surprisingly, differences after 8 yr in C were due to carbonate and not organic C fractions, where carbonate was similar to 250 g C/m(2) lower to 1-m soil depth under exotic than native plantings. Our results indicate that soil carbonate is an active pool and can respond to differences in plant species traits over timescales of years. Significant losses of inorganic C might be avoided by conserving native grasslands in subhumid ecosystems.

AB The maximum entropy theory of ecology (METE) applies the concept of "entropy" from information theory to predict macroecological patterns. The energetic predictions of the METE rely on predetermined metabolic scaling from external theories, and this reliance diminishes the testability of the theory. In this work, I build parameterized METE models by treating the metabolic scaling exponent as a free parameter, and I use the maximum-likelihood method to obtain empirically plausible estimates of the exponent. I test the models using the individual tree data from an oak-dominated deciduous forest in the northeastern United States and from a tropical forest in central Panama. My analysis shows that the metabolic scaling exponents predicted from the parameterized METE models deviate from that of the metabolic theory of ecology and exhibit large variation, at both community and population levels. Assemblage and population abundance may act as ecological constraints that regulate the individual-level metabolic scaling behavior. This study provides a novel example of the use of the parameterized METE models to reveal the biological processes of individual organisms. The implication and possible extensions of the parameterized METE models are discussed.

AB A critical tool in assessing ecosystem change is the analysis of long-term data sets, yet such information is generally sparse and often unavailable for many habitats. Kelp forests are an example of rapidly changing ecosystems that are in most cases data poor. Because kelp forests are highly dynamic and have high intrinsic interannual variability, understanding how regional-scale drivers are driving kelp populations-and particularly how kelp populations are responding to climate change-requires long-term data sets. However, much of the work on kelp responses to climate change has focused on just a few, relatively long-lived, perennial, canopy-forming species. To understand how kelp populations with different life history traits are responding to climate-related variability, we leverage 35 yr of Landsat satellite imagery to track the population size of an annual, ruderal kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana, across Oregon. We found high levels of interannual variability in Nereocystis canopy area and varying population trajectories over the last 35 yr. Surprisingly, Oregon Nereocystis population sizes were unresponsive to a 2014 marine heat wave accompanied by increases in urchin densities that decimated northern California Nereocystis populations. Some Oregon Nereocystis populations have even increased in area relative to pre-2014 levels. Analysis of environmental drivers found that Nereocystis population size was negatively correlated with estimated nitrate levels and positively correlated with winter wave height. This pattern is the inverse of the predicted relationship based on extensive prior work on the perennial kelp Macrocystis pyrifera and may be related to the annual life cycle of Nereocystis. This article demonstrates (1) the value of novel remote sensing tools to create long-term data sets that may challenge our understanding of nearshore marine species and (2) the need to incorporate life history traits into our theory of how climate change will shape the ocean of the future.

AB Current evidence suggests that tree-fall gaps can influence forest structure and dynamics by enabling certain species guilds to persist over the long term. Here we assessed the development of local size hierarchies and asymmetric competition for light in tree-fall gaps, and the role played by these two processes for the persistence of rare light-demanding species in the Barro Colorado Island Forest Dynamics Plot (Panama). We performed spatial point pattern analysis, considering both the spatial locations (x,y) and the diameter at breast height (DBH) of all the woody plant recruits from the 1985 and 2000 censuses located in tree-fall gaps, and followed their fate up to the 1990-2010 and 2005-2010 censuses, respectively. For these two recruit cohorts, we found that, from the initial census until 5-10 yr later, close neighbors presented a larger DBH than the mean DBH of all individuals within gaps, which points to a positive growth response of recruits to the increased light levels in the gap centers. However, close neighbors of the 1985 cohort also showed larger than expected DBH differences that disappeared in subsequent censuses, indicating an enhancement of size differences between neighbors and the mortality of the smaller individuals. Finally, for both recruit cohorts, we found that 10-15 yr after gap formation, surviving individuals of rare light-demanding species had a negative impact on survival of neighboring individuals of other species. Our results indicate that gaps favor the persistence of rare light-demanding species through the development of local size hierarchies and asymmetric competition for light. The strength of this process, however, apparently depends upon gap size and the role played by the woody plants already existing at the time of gap formation in early colonization. Moreover, our findings suggest that in this forest, gaps may enhance colonization of plant species typical of nearby dry tropical areas, and that, over the coming decades, similar processes could strongly modify the structure and dynamics of moist tropical forests in the region.

AB The introduction of nonnative species and reductions in native biodiversity have resulted in substantial changes in vector and host communities globally, but the consequences for pathogen transmission are poorly understood. In lowland Hawaii, bird communities are composed of primarily introduced species, with scattered populations of abundant native species. We examined the influence of avian host community composition, specifically the role of native and introduced species, as well as host diversity, on the prevalence of avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum) in the southern house mosquito (Culex quinquefasciatus). We also explored the reciprocal effect of malaria transmission on native host populations and demography. Avian malaria infection prevalence in mosquitoes increased with the density and relative abundance of native birds, as well as host community competence, but was uncorrelated with host diversity. Avian malaria transmission was estimated to reduce population growth rates of Hawai'i Modified Letter Turned Commaamakihi (Chlorodrepanis virens) by 7-14%, but mortality from malaria could not explain gaps in this species' distribution at our sites. Our results suggest that, in Hawaii, native host species increase pathogen transmission to mosquitoes, but introduced species can also support malaria transmission alone. The increase in pathogen transmission with native bird abundance leads to additional disease mortality in native birds, further increasing disease impacts in an ecological feedback cycle. In addition, vector abundance was higher at sites without native birds and this overwhelmed the effects of host community composition on transmission such that infected mosquito abundance was highest at sites without native birds. Higher disease risk at these sites due to higher vector abundance could inhibit recolonization and recovery of native species to these areas. More broadly, this work shows how differences in host competence for a pathogen among native and introduced taxa can influence transmission and highlights the need to examine this question in other systems to determine the generality of this result.

AB The species composition of local communities varies in space, and its similarity generally decreases with increasing geographic distance between communities, a phenomenon known as distance decay of similarity. It is, however, not known how changes in local species composition affect ecological processes, that is, whether they lead to differences in the local composition of species' functional roles. We studied eight seed-dispersal networks along the South American Andes and compared them with regard to their species composition and their composition of functional roles. We tested (1) if changes in bird species composition lead to changes in the composition of bird functional roles, and (2) if the similarity in species composition and functional-role composition decreased with increasing geographic distance between the networks. We also used cluster analysis to (3) identify bird species with similar roles across all networks based on the similarity in the plants they consume, (i) considering only the species identity of the plants and (ii) considering the functional traits of the plants. Despite strong changes in species composition, the networks along the Andes showed similar composition of functional roles. (1) Changes in species composition generally did not lead to changes in the composition of functional roles. (2) Similarity in species composition, but not functional-role composition, decreased with increasing geographic distance between the networks. (3) The cluster analysis considering the functional traits of plants identified bird species with similar functional roles across all networks. The similarity in functional roles despite the high species turnover suggests that the ecological process of seed dispersal is organized similarly along the Andes, with similar functional roles fulfilled locally by different sets of species. The high species turnover, relative to functional turnover, also indicates that a large number of bird species are needed to maintain the seed-dispersal process along the Andes.

AB The ability to predict how predators structure ecosystems has been shown to depend on identifying both consumptive effects (CEs) and nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) of predators on prey fitness. Prey populations may also be affected by interactions between multiple predators across life stages of the prey and by environmental factors such as disturbance. However, the intersection of these multiple drivers of prey dynamics has yet to be empirically evaluated. We addressed this knowledge gap using eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), a species known to suffer NCEs, as the focal prey. Over 4 months, we manipulated orthogonally the life stage (none, juvenile, adult, or both) at which oysters experienced simulated predation (CE) and exposure to olfactory cues of a juvenile oyster predator (crab), adult predator (conch), sequentially the crab and then the conch, or none. We replicated this experiment at three sites along an environmental gradient in a Florida (USA) estuary. For both juvenile and adult oysters, survival was reduced solely by CEs, and variation in growth was best explained by among-site variation in water flow, with a much smaller and negative effect of predator cue. Adults exposed to conch cue exhibited reduced growth (an NCE), but this effect was outweighed by a positive CE on growth: Surviving oysters grew faster at lower densities. Finally, conch cue reduced larval settlement (another NCE), but this was swamped by among-site variation in larval supply. This research highlights how strong environmental gradients and predator CEs may outweigh the influence of NCEs, even in prey known to respond to predator cues. These findings serve as a cautionary tale for the importance of evaluating NCE processes over temporal scales and across environmental gradients relevant to prey demography.

AB Models of plant-plant interactions underpin our understanding of species coexistence, invasive plant impacts, and plant community responses to climate change. In recent studies, models of competitive interactions failed predictive tests, thereby casting doubt on results of many past studies. We believe these model failures owe at least partly to heterogeneity in unmodeled factors (e.g., nutrients, soil pathogens) that affect both target plants and neighboring competitors. Such heterogeneity is ubiquitous, and models that do not account for it will suffer omitted variable bias. We used instrumental variables analysis to test for and correct omitted variable bias in studies that followed common protocols for measuring plant competition. In an observational study, omitted variables caused competition to seem like mutualism. In a quasi-experiment that partially controlled competitor abundances with seeding, omitted variables caused competition to seem about 35% weaker than it really was, even though the experiment occurred in an abandoned agricultural field where environmental heterogeneity was expected to be relatively low. Despite decades of research, consistently accurate estimates of competitive interactions remain elusive. The most foolproof way around this problem is true experiments that avoid omitted variable bias by completely controlling competitor abundances, but such experiments are rare.

AB Climate change is altering the interactions among plants and soil organisms in ways that will alter the structure and function of ecosystems. We reviewed the literature and developed a map of studies focused on how the three most common types of mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal [AM], ectomycorrhizal [EcM], and ericoid mycorrhizal [ErM] fungi) respond to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations (eCO(2)), climatic warming, and changes in the distribution of precipitation. Broadly, we ask how do mycorrhizal fungi respond to climate change, how do these responses vary by fungal type, and how do mycorrhizal traits influence plant adaptation, movement, or extinction in response to climatic change? First, we found that 92% of studies were conducted in the northern hemisphere, and plant host, ecosystem type and study location were only correlated with each other in the northern hemisphere because studies across all mycorrhizal fungal types were only common in the northern hemisphere. Second, we show that temperature and rainfall variability had more variable effects than eCO(2) on mycorrhizal fungal structures, but these effects were context dependent. Third, while mycorrhizal fungal types vary in their responses to climate change, it appears that warming leads to more variable responses in ectomycorrhizal than in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Finally, we discuss common traits of mycorrhizal fungi that could aid in fungal and plant adaption to climate change. We posit that mycorrhizal fungi can buffer plant hosts against extinction risk, they can facilitate or retard the dispersal success of plants moving away from poor environments, and, by buffering host plants, they can enable host plant adaptation to new climates. All of these influences are, however, context dependent a finding that reflects the complex traits of mycorrhizal fungi as a group, the diversity of plant species they associate with and the variation in ecosystems in which they reside. Overall, while we point out many gaps in our understanding of the influence of climate changes on mycorrhizal fungi, we also highlight the large number of opportunities for researching plant and mycorrhizal fungal responses to and mitigation of climate changes.

AB Recent discussions of model selection and multimodel inference highlight a general challenge for researchers: how to convey the explanatory content of a hypothesized model or set of competing models clearly. The advice from statisticians for scientists employing multimodel inference is to develop a well-thought-out set of candidate models for comparison, though precise instructions for how to do that are typically not given. A coherent body of knowledge, which falls under the general term causal analysis, now exists for examining the explanatory scientific content of candidate models. Much of the literature on causal analysis has been recently developed, and we suspect may not be familiar to many ecologists. This body of knowledge comprises a set of graphical tools and axiomatic principles to support scientists in their endeavors to create "well-formed hypotheses," as statisticians are asking them to do. Causal analysis is complementary to methods such as structural equation modeling, which provides the means for evaluation of proposed hypotheses against data. In this paper, we summarize and illustrate a set of principles that can guide scientists in their quest to develop explanatory hypotheses for evaluation. The principles presented in this paper have the capacity to close the communication gap between statisticians, who urge scientists to develop well-thought-out coherent models, and scientists, who would like some practical advice for exactly how to do that.

AB Extreme climate events, such as drought, are becoming increasingly important drivers of plant community change, yet little is known about their impacts on invasive plants. Further, drought impacts may be altered by other anthropogenic stressors, such as eutrophication. We found drought dramatically reduced density of invasive Lepidium latifolium in salt marshes, and this die-back was mitigated by nutrient addition. In a 3-yr field experiment (2014-2016) conducted during an unprecedented drought (2012-2015), we tracked the effects of drought and nutrient addition on the plant community. We conducted this research at four salt marshes across a salinity gradient in the San Francisco Bay, California, USA. We manipulated paired native and invaded plots, one-half of which were treated monthly with N and P for 1.5 yr during the most intense period of the drought and one subsequent wet winter. In addition, we monitored unmanipulated L. latifolium-invaded transects within our freshest and most saline sites throughout the three years of our manipulative experiment and one additional wet winter. We documented a dramatic die-back of invasive L. latifolium during extreme drought, with reductions in stem density (52-100%) and height (17-47%) that were more severe at low salinity sites than high salinity sites. We found nutrient application lessened the effect of drought on L. latifolium stem density, but not height. In native plots, extreme drought reduced native plant cover (4-24%), but nutrient addition mitigated this impact. Interestingly, native plants in invaded plots did not suffer reductions in cover due to drought, perhaps because they were simultaneously benefiting from the die-back of the invader. Our results show drought negatively impacted both native and invasive plants and this impact was stronger on the invader, which experienced persistent declines two years after the end of the drought. However, by mitigating the effect of drought on invasive plants, nutrient addition potentially erased the advantage drought provided native plants over invasive plants under ambient nutrient conditions.

AB The spatial and temporal linkages between turnover of soil microbial communities and their associated functions remain largely unexplored in terrestrial ecosystems. Yet defining these relationships and how they vary across ecosystems and microbial lineages is key to incorporating microbial communities into ecological forecasts and ecosystem models. To define linkages between turnover of soil bacterial and fungal communities and their function we sampled fungal and bacterial composition, abundance, and enzyme activities across a 3-ha area of wet tropical primary forest over 2 yr. We show that fungal and bacterial communities both exhibited temporal turnover, but turnover of both groups was much lower than in temperate ecosystems. Turnover over time was driven by gain and loss of microbial taxa and not changes in abundance of individual species present in multiple samples. Only fungi varied over space with idiosyncratic variation that did not increase linearly with distance among sampling locations. Only phosphorus-acquiring enzyme activities were linked to shifts in septate, decomposer fungal abundance; no enzymes were affected by composition or diversity of fungi or bacteria. Although temporal and spatial variation in composition was appreciable, because turnover of microbial communities did not alter the functional repertoire of decomposing enzymes, functional redundancy among taxa may be high in this ecosystem. Slow temporal turnover of tropical soil microbial communities and large functional redundancy suggests that shifts in abundance of particular functional groups may capture ecosystem function more accurately than composition in these heterogeneous ecosystems.

AB A central question of community ecology is to understand how the interplay between processes of the Neutral Theory (e.g., immigration and ecological drift) and niche-based processes (e.g., environmental filtering, intra- and interspecific density dependence) shape species diversity in competitive communities. The articulation between these two categories of mechanisms can be studied through the lens of the intermediate organizational level of "functional groups" (FGs), defined as clusters of species with similar traits. Indeed, FGs stress ecological differences among species and are thus likely to unravel non-neutral interactions within communities. Here we presented a novel approach to explore how FGs affect species coexistence by comparing species and functional diversity patterns. Our framework considers the Neutral Theory as a mechanistic null hypothesis. It assesses how much the functional diversity deviates from species diversity in communities, and compares this deviation, called the "average functional deviation," to a neutral baseline. We showed that the average functional deviation can indicate reduced negative density dependence or environmental filtering among FGs. We validated our framework using simulations illustrating the two situations. We further analyzed tropical tree communities in Western Ghats, India. Our analysis of the average functional deviation revealed environmental filtering between deciduous and evergreen FGs along a broad rainfall gradient. By contrast, we did not find clear evidence for reduced density dependence among FGs. We predict that applying our approach to new case studies where environmental gradients are milder and FGs are more clearly associated to resource partitioning should reveal the missing pattern of reduced density dependence among FGs.

AB Dispersal limitation may drive the structure of fungal microbiota of plant roots at small spatial scales. Fungal root microorganisms disperse through the plant rooting systems from hosts to hosts. Due to a pronounced host-preference effect, the composition of endophytic root microbiota may follow plant distribution. A given plant community may hence include a matrix of host-plant species that represent various habitat permeabilities to fungal dispersal in the floristic landscape. We experimentally tested the effect of host-plant isolation on endophytic fungal assemblages (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Glomeromycotina) inhabiting Brachypodium pinnatum roots. We calculated host-plant isolation using Euclidean distance (distance-based dispersal limitation) and resistance distance (functional-based dispersal limitation), based on host presences. All fungal groups were more influenced by the resistance distance between B. pinnatum than by the Euclidean distance. Fungal dispersal was hence strongly related to the spatial distribution of the host plants. The fungal groups displayed however different responses (in richness, abundance, and composition) to host isolation. Additionally, fungal assemblages were more strongly controlled by the degree of connectivity between host plants during the prior year than by current connectivity. This discrepancy may be due to changes in plant species coverage in a year and/or to the delay of dispersal response of fungi. This study it the first to demonstrate how small-scale host-plant distributions mediate connectivity in microorganisms. The consequences of plant distributions for the permeability of the floristic landscape to fungi dispersal appear to control fungal assemblages, but with possibly different mechanisms for the different fungal groups.

AB Climate warming is predicted to alter routing and flows of energy through food webs because of the critical and varied effects of temperature on physiological rates, community structure, and trophic dynamics. Few studies, however, have experimentally assessed the net effect of warming on energy flux and food web dynamics in natural intact communities. Here, we test how warming affects energy flux and the trophic basis of production in a natural invertebrate food web by experimentally heating a stream reach in southwest Iceland by similar to 4 degrees C for 2 yr and comparing its response to an unheated reference stream. Previous results from this experiment showed that warming led to shifts in the structure of the invertebrate assemblage, with estimated increases in total metabolic demand but no change in annual secondary production. We hypothesized that elevated metabolic demand and invariant secondary production would combine to increase total consumption of organic matter in the food web, if diet composition did not change appreciably with warming. Dietary composition of primary consumers indeed varied little between streams and among years, with gut contents primarily consisting of diatoms (72.9%) and amorphous detritus (19.5%). Diatoms dominated the trophic basis of production of primary consumers in both study streams, contributing 79-86% to secondary production. Although warming increased the flux of filamentous algae within the food web, total resource consumption did not increase as predicted. The neutral net effect of warming on total energy flow through the food web was a result of taxon-level variation in responses to warming, a neutral effect on total invertebrate production, and strong trophic redundancy within the invertebrate assemblage. Thus, food webs characterized by a high degree of trophic redundancy may be more resistant to the effects of climate warming than those with more diverse and specialized consumers.

AB Native habitat-forming species can facilitate invasion by reducing environmental stress or consumer pressure. However, the intensity of one stressor along a local gradient may differ when expanding the scale of observation to encompass major variations in background environmental conditions. In this study, we determined how facilitation of the invasive porcelain crab, Petrolisthes elongatus, by the native tube-forming serpulid, Galeolaria caespitosa, varied with environmental gradients at local (tidal height) and larger (wave exposure) spatial scales. G. caespitosa constructs a complex calcareous matrix on the underside of intertidal boulders and we predicted that its positive effects on P. elongatus density would increase in intensity with shore height and be stronger at wave-sheltered than wave-exposed locations. To test these predictions, we conducted two experiments. First, we determined the effects of serpulid presence (boulders with live or dead serpulid matrix vs. bare boulders) at six shore heights that covered the intertidal distribution of P. elongatus. Second, we determined the effects of serpulid presence (present vs. absent), shore height (high vs. low) and wave exposure (sheltered vs. exposed) on crabs across six locations within the invaded range in northern Tasmania, Australia. In Experiment 1, the presence of serpulids (either dead or alive) enhanced P. elongatus densities at all shore heights, with facilitation intensity (as determined by a relative interaction index; RII) tending to increase with shore height. In Experiment 2, serpulids facilitated P. elongatus across shore heights and wave exposures, although crab densities were lower at high shore levels of wave-sheltered locations. However, the intensity of crab facilitation by serpulids was greater on wave-sheltered than on wave-exposed shores, but only at the high shore level. This study demonstrates that local effects of native habitat-formers on invasive species are dependent on prevailing environmental conditions at larger spatial scales and that, under more stressful conditions, invaders become increasingly reliant on positive interactions with native habitat-formers. Increased strength of local-scale facilitation by native species, dampening broader scale variations in environmental stressors, could enhance the ability of invasive species to establish self-sustaining populations in the invaded range.

ID BACTERIOPLANKTON; DISPERSAL; DIVERSITY; DYNAMICS
AB The movement of organisms across habitat boundaries has important consequences for populations, communities, and ecosystems. However, because most species are not well adapted to all habitat types, dispersal into suboptimal habitats could induce physiological changes associated with persistence strategies that influence community assembly. For example, high rates of cross-boundary dispersal are thought to maintain sink populations of terrestrial bacteria in aquatic habitats, but these bacteria may also persist by lowering their metabolic activity, introducing metabolic heterogeneity that buffers the population against species sorting. To differentiate between these assembly processes, we analyzed bacterial composition along a hydrological flow path from terrestrial soils through an aquatic reservoir by sequencing the active and total (active + inactive) portions of the community. When metabolic heterogeneity was ignored, our data were consistent with views that cross-boundary dispersal is important for structuring aquatic bacterial communities. In contrast, we found evidence for strong species sorting in the active portion of the aquatic community, suggesting that dispersal may have a weaker effect than persistence strategies on aquatic community assembly. By accounting for metabolic heterogeneity in complex communities, our findings clarify the roles of local- and regional-scale assembly processes in terrestrial-aquatic meta-ecosystems.

AB Identifying the factors that destabilize communities is critical for predicting and mitigating the ecological impacts of environmental change. Although theory has shown that local ecosystem size and regional dispersal can determine biodiversity, less is known about the direct and indirect effects of these factors on community stability. Here we show that multitrophic community instability of invertebrates and fishes in coastal ponds is negatively related to local pond size and positively related to distance to the ocean, a proxy for dispersal limitation. Importantly, the effects of pond size and distance on instability were direct rather than indirectly mediated by species richness. This suggests that the diversity-stability relationship is an epiphenomenon whose resolution is neither necessary nor sufficient to understand the stability of these multitrophic communities. Instead, well-established and easily measured local and regional factors historically linked to species richness can be used to predict multitrophic community stability in a variable world.

AB Increased incorporation of terrestrial organic matter (t-OM) into consumer biomass (allochthony) is believed to reduce growth capacity. In this study, we examined the relationship between crustacean zooplankton allochthony and production in a boreal lake that displays strong seasonal variability in t-OM inputs. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found no effect of allochthony on production at the community and the species levels. The high-frequency seasonal sampling (time-for-space) allowed for estimating the efficiency of zooplankton in converting this external carbon source to growth. From the daily t-OM inputs in the lake (57-3,027 kg C/d), the zooplankton community transferred 0.2% into biomass (0.01-2.36 kg C/d); this level was of the same magnitude as the carbon transfer efficiency for algal-derived carbon (0.4%). In the context of the boundless carbon cycle, which integrates inland waters as a biologically active component of the terrestrial landscape, the use of the time-for-space approach for the quantifying of t-OM trophic transfer efficiency by zooplankton is a critical step toward a better understanding of the effects of increasing external carbon fluxes on pelagic food webs.

AB Seasonal windows of opportunity represent intervals of time within a year during which organisms have improved prospects of achieving life history aims such as growth or reproduction, and may be commonly structured by temporal variation in abiotic factors, bottom-up factors, and top-down factors. Although seasonal windows of opportunity are likely to be common, few studies have examined the factors that structure seasonal windows of opportunity in time. Here, we experimentally manipulated host-plant age in two milkweed species (Asclepias fascicularis and Asclepias speciosa) in order to investigate the role of plant-species-specific and plant-age-varying traits on the survival and growth of monarch caterpillars (Danaus plexippus). We show that the two plant species showed diverging trajectories of defense traits with increasing age. These species-specific and age-varying host-plant traits significantly affected the growth and survival of monarch caterpillars through both resource quality- and quantity-based constraints. The effects of plant age on monarch developmental success were comparable to and sometimes larger than those of plant-species identity. We conclude that species-specific and age-varying plant traits are likely to be important factors with the potential to structure seasonal windows of opportunity for monarch development, and examine the implications of these findings for both broader patterns in the ontogeny of plant defense traits and the specific ecology of milkweed-monarch interactions in a changing world.

AB Species richness and productivity are correlated at global and regional scales, but the mechanisms linking them are inconclusive. The most commonly invoked mechanism, the more-individuals hypothesis (MIH), hypothesizes that increased productivity leads to increased food resource availability, which leads to an increased number of individuals supporting more species. Empirical evidence for the MIH remains mixed despite a substantial literature. Here we used simulations to determine whether interannual population variability could be masking a "true" MIH relationship. In each simulation, fixed linear relationships between productivity, richness, and 50-yr average abundance mimicked the MIH mechanism. Abundance was allowed to vary annually and sampled for 1-40 yr. Linear regressions of richness on sampled abundance assessed the probability of detecting the fixed MIH relationship. Medium to high population variability with short-term sampling (1-3 yr) led to poor detection of the fixed MIH relationship. Notably, this level of sampling and population variability describes nearly all MIH studies to date. Long-term sampling (5+ yr) led to improved detection of the fixed relationship; thus it is necessary to detect support for the MIH reliably. Such sampling duration is nonexistent in the MIH literature. Robust future studies of the MIH necessitate consideration of interannual population variability.

AB Sex-biased survival linked to anthropogenic threats places populations at risk. We show the utility of long-term multidecadal photo-identification (photo-id) combined with long-term high-resolution (Fastloc-GPS) satellite telemetry to investigate the links between mortality rates and patterns of movement for a wide-ranging, endangered marine vertebrate. Using a photo-identification database of 947 loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) compiled over 18 yr, we estimated greater annual survival rates of females (0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87-0.90) compared to males (0.73; 95% CI 0.67-0.78). For males satellite-tracked across multiple breeding seasons, 100% (26 of 26) returned to the same breeding site, suggesting the calculated lower male survival rate was likely not due to emigration to breed elsewhere. 10,111 and 2,524 tracking days for males (n = 39 individuals) and females (n = 18 individuals), respectively, revealed different habitat-use patterns outside the breeding season: males tended to occupy foraging sites closer to shore and closer to breeding sites but, due to their generally annual breeding, compared to biennial breeding for females, males migrated further per year on average. These differences in movement patterns likely contribute to higher mortality in males through increased interaction with anthropogenic threats. Long-term identification coupled with tracking offers great promise for estimating the survival rates of other wide-ranging species.

AB An optimal habitat-selecting organism should use a dispersal strategy that enables occupation of the habitat yielding greatest fitness. The strategy is complicated when habitat quality varies through time. Theory predicts that the long-term distribution of individuals will match mean habitat quality while undermatching current habitat quality. I tested the prediction with experiments on controlled populations of meadow voles occupying two pairs of field enclosures. I released equal numbers, and equal sexes, of voles in each enclosure, and varied resource abundance between enclosures by supplemental feeding. I measured the voles' response with giving-up densities (GUDs) in artificial foraging patches, and with live-trapping at the end of the experiment. The data were consistent with only one of four a priori dispersal models. Giving-up densities declined with resource supply because short-term supply had no effect on population density. GUDs were invariant to the time course of the experiment because densities were proportional to each enclosure's long-term mean quality. Similar patterns in sex ratios and patterns of habitat occupation by juvenile voles born during the experiment reinforce the interpretation of time-averaged habitat matching. This study adds to the cumulating evidence that strategies of space use converge toward behavioral and evolutionary optima.

AB A decade ago, the general stress paradigm (GSP) aimed to develop a predictive framework linking predator effects to ecosystem function. The GSP was based on the notion that animals, across taxa, exhibit similar physiological responses to predation risk that divert resources from growth and reproduction (which require N-rich biomolecules [i.e., protein]) to emergency functions (which require C-rich biomolecules [e.g., carbohydrates]). The GSP predicts that stressed prey should have a greater dietary demand for C-rich resources, a higher body C:N ratio, and elevated N excretion. Now, 10 yr later, we aim to revisit the GSP-using quantitative meta-analysis to test the original predictions of the GSP and how (1) predator hunting mode, (2) multiple stressors, and (3) prey dietary shifts affect prey stoichiometric responses to predation risk. Our data set was consistent with previous work showing that predation risk increases prey glucocorticoid levels and metabolic rates and decreases prey growth rates. We found that predation risk tended to decrease the fat, carbohydrate, and protein content of prey bodies; increased the C:P and N:P of prey bodies; but had no effect on the C, N, P, or C:N content of prey bodies. Additionally, we found no effect of predation risk on the N content of prey excretions. Prey responses to predation risk were unaffected by multiple stressors or the prey's ability to shift their diet, but predator hunting mode did affect the nature of prey stoichiometric responses. Specifically, ambush predators decreased prey macronutrient content and suppressed prey growth, and active predators had no effect on prey macronutrient content and a smaller effect on prey growth than ambush predators. The significant effects of predation risk were supported by robust fail-safe numbers, despite the high between-comparison heterogeneity that was found in all analyses. Our findings highlight the need (1) to test the underlying mechanisms and emerging patterns of the GSP in diverse taxa, (2) to explore the mismatch between prey macronutrient content and elemental stoichiometry, and (3) to expand the conceptual framework to include more inducible defenses (e.g., behavioral and morphological) and predator traits.

AB Omnivores have long been known to play an important role in determining the stability of ecological communities. Recent theoretical studies have suggested that they may also increase the resilience of their communities to habitat destruction, one of the major drivers of species extinctions globally. However, these outcomes were obtained for minimal food webs consisting of only a single omnivore and its prey species, while much more complex communities can be anticipated in nature. In this study, we undertake a systematic comparative analysis of the robustness of metacommunities containing various omnivory structures to habitat loss and fragmentation using a mathematical model. We observe that, in general, omnivores are better able to survive facing habitat destruction than specialist predators of similar trophic level. However, the community as a whole does not always benefit from the presence of omnivores, as they may drive their intraguild prey to extinction. We also analyze the frequency with which these modules occur in a set of empirical food webs, and demonstrate that variation in their rate of occurrence is consistent with our model predictions. Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering the complete food web in which an omnivore is embedded, suggesting that future study should focus on more holistic community analysis.

AB Natural populations are increasingly threatened with collapse at the hands of anthropogenic effects. Predicting population collapse with the help of generic early warning signals (EWS) may provide a prospective tool for identifying species or populations at highest risk. However, pattern-to-process methods such as EWS have a multitude of challenges to overcome to be useful, including the low signal-to-noise ratio of ecological systems and the need for high quality time series data. The inclusion of trait dynamics with EWS has been proposed as a more robust tool to predict population collapse. However, the length and resolution of available time series are highly variable from one system to another, especially when generation time is considered. As yet, it remains unknown how this variability with regards to generation time will alter the efficacy of EWS. Here we take both a simulation- and experimental-based approach to assess the impacts of relative time series length and resolution on the forecasting ability of EWS. We show that EWS' performance decreases with decreasing time-series length. However, there was no evident decrease in EWS performance as resolution decreased. Our simulations suggest a relative time series length between 10 and five generations as a minimum requirement for accurate forecasting by abundance-based EWS. However, when trait information is included alongside abundance-based EWS, we find positive signals at lengths one-half of what was required without them. We suggest that, in systems where specific traits are known to affect demography, trait data should be monitored and included alongside abundance data to improve forecasting reliability.

AB Long-term ecological research can resolve effects of disturbance on ecosystem dynamics by capturing the scale of disturbance and interactions with environmental changes. To quantify how disturbances interact with long-term directional changes (sea-level rise, freshwater restoration), we studied 17 yr of monthly dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), and phosphorus (TP) concentrations and bacterioplankton productivity across freshwater-to-marine estuary gradients exposed to multiple disturbance events (e.g., droughts, fire, hurricanes, and low-temperature anomalies) and long-term increases in water levels. By studying two neighboring drainages that differ in hydrologic connectivity, we additionally tested how disturbance legacies are shaped by hydrologic connectivity. We predicted that disturbance events would interact with long-term increases in water levels in freshwater and marine ecosystems to increase spatiotemporal similarity (i.e., synchrony) of organic matter, nutrients, and microbial activities. Wetlands along the larger, deeper, and tidally influenced Shark River Slough (SRS) drainage had higher and more variable DOC, TN, and TP concentrations than wetlands along the smaller, shallower, tidally restricted Taylor River Slough/Panhandle (TS/Ph) drainage. Along SRS, DOC concentrations declined with proximity to coast, and increased in magnitude and variability following drought and flooding in 2015 and a hurricane in 2017. Along TS/Ph, DOC concentrations varied by site (higher in marine than freshwater wetlands) but not year. In both drainages, increases in TN from upstream freshwater marshes occurred following fire in 2008 and droughts in 2010 and 2015, whereas downstream increases in TP occurred with coastal storm surge from hurricanes in 2005 and 2017. Decreases in DOC:TN and DOC:TP were explained by increased TN and TP. Increases in bacterioplankton productivity occurred throughout both drainages following low-temperature events (2010 and 2011) and a hurricane (2017). Long-term TN and TP concentrations and bacterioplankton productivity were correlated (r > 0.5) across a range of sampling distances (1-50 km), indicating spatiotemporal synchrony. DOC concentrations were not synchronized across space or time. Our study advances disturbance ecology theory by illustrating how disturbance events interact with long-term environmental changes and hydrologic connectivity to determine the magnitude and extent of disturbance legacies. Understanding disturbance legacies will enhance prediction and enable more effective management of rapidly changing ecosystems.

AB Tropical forests challenge us to understand biodiversity, as numerous seemingly similar species persist on only a handful of shared resources. Recent ecological theory posits that biodiversity is sustained by a combination of species differences reducing interspecific competition and species similarities increasing time to competitive exclusion. Together, these mechanisms counterintuitively predict that competing species should cluster by traits, in contrast with traditional expectations of trait overdispersion. Here, we show for the first time that trees in a tropical forest exhibit a clustering pattern. In a 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island in Panama, species abundances exhibit clusters in two traits connected to light capture strategy, suggesting that competition for light structures community composition. Notably, we find four clusters by maximum height, quantitatively supporting the classical grouping of Neotropical woody plants into shrubs, understory, midstory, and canopy layers.

AB In addition to a rise in mean air and water temperatures, more frequent and intense extreme climate events (such as heat waves) have been recorded around the globe during the past decades. These environmental changes are projected to intensify further in the future, and we still know little about how they will affect ecological processes driving harmful cyanobacterial bloom formation. Therefore, we conducted a long-term experiment in 400-L shallow freshwater mesocosms, where we evaluated the effects of a constant +4 degrees C increase in mean water temperatures and compared it with a fluctuating warming scenario ranging from 0 to +8 degrees C (i.e., including heat waves) but with the same +4 degrees C long-term elevation in mean water temperatures. We focused on investigating not only warming effects on cyanobacterial pelagic dynamics (phenology and biomass levels), but also on their recruitment from sediments-which are a fundamental part of their life history for which the response to warming remains largely unexplored. Our results demonstrate that (1) a warmer environment not only induces a seasonal advancement and boosts biomass levels of specific cyanobacterial species in the pelagic environment, but also increases their recruitment rates from the sediments, and (2) these species-specific benthic and pelagic processes respond differently depending on whether climate warming is expressed only as an increase in mean water temperatures or, in addition, through an increased warming variability (including heat waves). These results are important because they show, for the first time, that climate warming can affect cyanobacterial dynamics at different life-history stages, all the way from benthic recruitment up to their establishment in the pelagic community. Furthermore, it also highlights that both cyanobacterial benthic recruitment and pelagic biomass dynamics may be different as a result of changes in the variability of warming conditions. We argue that these findings are a critical first step to further our understanding of the relative importance of increased recruitment rates for harmful cyanobacterial bloom formation under different climate change scenarios.

AB Lianas, woody climbing plants, are increasing in many tropical forests, with cascading effects such as decreased forest productivity, carbon sequestration, and resilience. Possible causes are increasing forest fragmentation, CO2 fertilization, and drought. Determining the primary changing species and their underlying vital rates help explain the liana trends. We monitored over 17,000 liana stems for 13 yr in 20 ha of old-growth forest in the Congo Basin, and here we report changes and vital rates for the community and for the 87 most abundant species. The total liana abundance declined from 15,007 lianas in 1994 to 11,090 in 2001 to 9,978 in 2007. Over half (52%) of the evaluated species have significantly declining populations, showing that the community response is not the result of changes in a few dominant species only. Species density change (i.e., the change in number of individuals per hectare) decreased with mortality rate, tended to increase with recruitment rate, but was independent of growth rate. Species change was independent of functional characteristics important for plant responses to fragmentation, CO2, and drought, such as lifetime light requirements, climbing and dispersal mechanism, and leaf size. These results indicate that in Congo lianas do not show the reputed global liana increase, but rather a decline, and that elements of the reputed drivers underlying global liana change do not apply to this DR Congo forest. We suggest warfare in the Congo Basin to have decimated the elephant population, leading to less disturbance, forest closure, and declining liana numbers. Our results imply that, in this tropical forest, local causes (i.e., disturbance) override more global causes of liana change resulting in liana decline, which sharply contrasts with the liana increase observed elsewhere.

AB Plants have evolved resource-conservative and resource-acquisitive strategies to deal with variability in rainfall, but interactions with dominant invasive species may undermine these adaptations. To investigate the relative effect of invaders on species with these two strategies, we manipulated rainfall and invasive grass presence and measured demographic rates in three resource-acquisitive and three resource-conservative native annual forbs. We found that invasive grasses were harmful to all of the target species, but especially the resource-acquisitive ones, and that these effects were stronger under experimental drought. Invasive grass presence under drought lowered per capita population growth rates of acquisitive natives through increased mortality and decreased seed set. While invasive grasses also decreased per capita growth rates of resource-conservative natives, they did so by increasing mortality under experimental watering and by limiting the production of seed under experimental drought. Invasive species can thus interact with climatic fluctuations to make bad years worse for resource-acquisitive natives and good years less good for resource-conservative natives, and they may generally tend to undermine the acquisitive strategy more than the conservative one.

AB Mexico is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world, with an important proportion of endemism mainly because of the convergence of the Nearctic and Neotropical biogeographic regions, which generate great diversity and species turnover at different spatial scales. However, most of our knowledge of the Mexican ant biota is limited to a few well-studied taxa, and we lack a comprehensive synthesis of ant biodiversity information. For instance, most of the knowledge available in the literature on Mexican ant fauna refers only to species lists by states, or is focused on only a few regions of the country, which prevents the study of several basic and applied aspects of ants, from diversity and distribution to conservation. Our aims in this data paper are therefore (1) to compile all the information available regarding ants across the Mexican territory, and (2) to identify major patterns in the gathered data set and geographic gaps in order to direct future sampling efforts. All records were obtained from raw data, including both unpublished and published information. After exhaustive filtering and updating information and synonyms, we compiled a total of 21,731 records for 887 ant species distributed throughout Mexico from 1894 to 2018. These records were concentrated mainly in the states of Chiapas (n = 6,902, 32.76%) and Veracruz de Ignacio de la Llave (n = 4,329, 19.92%), which together comprise half the records. The subfamily with the highest number of records was Myrmicinae (n = 10,458 records, 48.12%), followed by Formicinae (n = 3,284, 15.11%) and Ponerinae (n = 1,914, 8.8%). Most ant records were collected in the Neotropical region of the country (n = 12,646, 58.19%), followed by the Mexican transition zone (n = 5,237, 24.09%) and the Nearctic region (n = 3,848, 17.72%). Native species comprised 95.46% of the records (n = 20,745). To the best of our knowledge, this is the most complete data set available to date in the literature for the country. We hope that this compilation will encourage researchers to explore different aspects of the population and community research of ants at different spatial scales, and to aid in the establishment of conservation policies and actions.

   ECOLOGICAL TRAPS; ICE; MOVEMENT
AB Divergent movement strategies have enabled wildlife populations to adapt to environmental change. In recent decades, the Southern Beaufort Sea subpopulation of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) has developed a divergent movement strategy in response to diminishing sea ice where the majority of the subpopulation (73-85%) stays on the sea ice in summer and the remaining bears move to land. Although declines in sea ice are generally considered a challenge to energy balance in polar bears residing in some regions of the Arctic, little quantitative data exists concerning the seasonal energy expenditures of this apex marine carnivore. We used GPS satellite collars with tri-axial accelerometers and conductivity sensors to measure the location, behavior, and energy expenditure of five adult female polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea across seasons of sea ice breakup and minimum extent. Using a Bayesian mixed-effects model, we found that energy expenditure was influenced by month, ocean depth, and habitat type (sea ice or land). Total energy expenditure from May through September ranged from 37.7 to 47.2 mJ/kg for individual bears. Bears that moved to land expended 7% more energy on average from May through September than bears that remained on the receding sea ice. In August, when bears were moving from the sea ice to land or moving north with the receding pack ice, bears that moved to land spent 7% more time swimming and expended 22% more energy. This means the immediate cost of moving to land exceeded the cost of remaining on the receding summer pack ice. These findings suggest a physiological reason why the majority of the Southern Beaufort Sea subpopulation continues to inhabit a diminishing summer ice platform. However, bears that moved to land spent 29% more time in preferred hunting habitats over the continental shelf than bears that remained on the sea ice. Bears on land also had access to subsistence-harvested bowhead whale carcasses. Hence, our findings indicate there may be a greater overall energetic benefit to move to land in this region, which suggests that the use of the diminishing summer sea ice may be functioning as an ecological trap.

AB Resource availability in agricultural landscapes has been disturbed for many organisms, including pollinator species. Abundance and diversity in flower availability benefit bee populations; however, little is known about which of protein or carbohydrate resources may limit their growth and reproductive performance. Here, we test the hypothesis of complementary resource limitation using a supplemental feeding approach. We applied this assumption with bumble bees (Bombus terrestris), assuming that colony growth and reproductive performance should depend on the continuous supply of carbohydrates and proteins, through the foraging for nectar and pollen, respectively. We placed wild-caught bumble bee colonies along a landscape gradient of seminatural habitats, and monitored the colonies' weight, foraging activity, and reproductive performance during the whole colony cycle. We performed supplemental feeding as an indicator of landscape resource limitation, using a factorial design consisting of the addition of sugar water (carbohydrate, supplemented or not) crossed by pollen (protein, supplemented or not). Bumble bee colony dynamics showed a clear seasonal pattern with a period of growth followed by a period of stagnation. Higher abundance of seminatural habitats resulted in reducing the proportion of pollen foragers relative to all foragers in both periods, and in improving the reproductive performance of bumble bees. Interestingly, the supplemental feeding of sugar water positively affected the colony weight during the stagnation period, and the supplemental feeding of pollen mitigated the landscape effect on pollen collection investment. Single and combined supplementation of sugar water and pollen increased the positive effect of seminatural habitats on reproductive performance. This study reveals a potential colimitation in pollen and nectar resources affecting foraging behavior and reproductive performance in bumble bees, and indicates that even in mixed agricultural landscapes with higher proportions of seminatural habitats, bumble bee populations face resource limitations. We conclude that the seasonal management of floral resources must be considered in conservation to support bumble bee populations and pollination services in farmlands.

AB We explain how to obtain a generalized maximum-likelihood chi-square statistic,XML2, and a full-model Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) statistic for piecewise structural equation modeling (SEM); that is, structural equations without latent variables whose causal topology can be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The full piecewise SEM is decomposed into submodels as a Markov network, each of which can have different distributional assumptions or functional links and that can be modeled by any method that produces maximum-likelihood parameter estimates. The generalized XML2 is a function of the difference in the maximum likelihoods of the model and its saturated equivalent and the full-model AIC is calculated by summing the AIC statistics of each of the submodels.

AB There is growing recognition that ecosystems may be more impacted by infrequent extreme climatic events than by changes in mean climatic conditions. This has led to calls for experiments that explore the sensitivity of ecosystems over broad ranges of climatic parameter space. However, because such response surface experiments have so far been limited in geographic and biological scope, it is not clear if differences between studies reflect geographic location or the ecosystem component considered. In this study, we manipulated rainfall entering tank bromeliads in seven sites across the Neotropics, and characterized the response of the aquatic ecosystem in terms of invertebrate functional composition, biological stocks (total invertebrate biomass, bacterial density) and ecosystem fluxes (decomposition, carbon, nitrogen). Of these response types, invertebrate functional composition was the most sensitive, even though, in some sites, the species pool had a high proportion of drought-tolerant families. Total invertebrate biomass was universally insensitive to rainfall change because of statistical averaging of divergent responses between functional groups. The response of invertebrate functional composition to rain differed between geographical locations because (1) the effect of rainfall on bromeliad hydrology differed between sites, and invertebrates directly experience hydrology not rainfall and (2) the taxonomic composition of some functional groups differed between sites, and families differed in their response to bromeliad hydrology. These findings suggest that it will be difficult to establish thresholds of "safe ecosystem functioning" when ecosystem components differ in their sensitivity to climatic variables, and such thresholds may not be broadly applicable over geographic space. In particular, ecological forecast horizons for climate change may be spatially restricted in systems where habitat properties mediate climatic impacts, and those, like the tropics, with high spatial turnover in species composition.

AB Understanding how severe disturbances and their interactions affect forests is key to projecting ecological change under a warming climate. Substantial increases in some biotic disturbances, such as bark beetle outbreaks, in temperate forest ecosystemsmay compromise recovery to a forest vegetation type (i.e., physiognomic recovery or resilience), especially if subsequent biotic disturbances (e.g., herbivory) alter recovery mechanisms. From 2005 to 2017, severe outbreaks (>90% mortality) of spruce bark beetles (SB, Dendroctonus rufipennis) affected Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) across 325,000 ha of spruce and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) forest in the southern Rocky Mountains, USA. Concurrently, an outbreak of western balsam bark beetle (WBBB, Dryocoetes confuses) infested subalpine fir across at least 47,000 of these hectares. We explored the capacity of 105 stands affected by one or two bark beetle outbreaks and browsing of juvenile trees by ungulates to return to a forest vegetation type in the context of pre-outbreak forest conditions and topography. Nine initial forest trajectories (i.e., at least several decades) were identified from four pre-outbreak forest types affected by three biotic disturbances that occurred at different spatial scales and severities. Most stands (86%) contained surviving nonhost adult trees in the main canopy (fir and aspen [Populus tremuloides]) and many surviving juveniles of all species, implying that they are currently on a trajectory for physiognomic recovery. Stands composed exclusively of large-diameter spruce were affected by a severe SB outbreak and were most vulnerable to a transition to a low-density forest, below regional stocking levels (<370 trees/ha). Greater pre-outbreak stand structural complexity and species diversity were key traits of stands with a higher potential for physiognomic recovery. However, all multispecies stands shifted in relative composition of the main canopy to nonhost species, suggesting low potential for compositional recovery over the next several decades. Most post-outbreak stands (86%) exceeded regional stocking levels with trees taller than the browse zone (<2 m). As such, ungulate browsing on over half of all juveniles will primarily affect the rate of infilling of the forest canopy and preferential browsing of more palatable species will influence the composition of the future forest canopy.

AB Ecosystems are changing at alarming rates because of climate change and a wide variety of other anthropogenic stressors. These stressors have the potential to cause phase shifts to less productive ecosystems. A major challenge for ecologists is to identify ecosystem attributes that enhance resilience and can buffer systems from shifts to less desirable alternative states. In this study, we used the Northern Channel Islands, California, as a model kelp forest ecosystem that had been perturbed from the loss of an important sea star predator due to a sea star wasting disease. To determine the mechanisms that prevent phase shifts from productive kelp forests to less productive urchin barrens, we compared pre- and postdisease predator assemblages as predictors of purple urchin densities. We found that prior to the onset of the disease outbreak, the sunflower sea star exerted strong predation pressures and was able to suppress purple urchin populations effectively. After the disease outbreak, which functionally extirpated the sunflower star, we found that the ecosystem response-urchin and algal abundances-depended on the abundance and/or size of remaining predator species. Inside Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), the large numbers and sizes of other urchin predators suppressed purple urchin populations resulting in kelp and understory algal growth. Outside of the MPAs, where these alternative urchin predators are fished, less abundant, and smaller, urchin populations grew dramatically in the absence of sunflower stars resulting in less kelp at these locations. Our results demonstrate that protected trophic redundancy inside MPAs creates a net of stability that could limit kelp forest ecosystem phase shifts to less desirable, alternative states when perturbed. This highlights the importance of harboring diversity and managing predator guilds.

AB Identifying the environmental drivers of population dynamics is crucial to predict changes in species abundances and distributions under climate change. Populations of the same species might differ in their responses as a result of intraspecific variation. Yet the importance of such differences remains largely unexplored. We examined the responses of latitudinally distant populations of the forest moss Hylocomiastrum umbratum along microclimate gradients in Sweden. We transplanted moss mats from southern and northern populations to 30 sites with contrasting microclimates (i.e., replicated field common gardens) within a forest landscape, and recorded growth and survival of individual shoots over 3 yr. To evaluate the importance of intraspecific variation in responses to environmental factors, we assessed effects of the interactions between population origin and microclimate drivers on growth and survival. Effects on overall performance of transplanted populations were estimated using the product of survival and growth. We found differences between southern and northern populations in the response to summer temperature and snowmelt date in one of three yearly transitions. In this year, southern populations performed better in warm, southern-like conditions than in cold, northern-like conditions; and the reverse pattern was true for northern populations. Survival of all populations decreased with evaporation, consistent with the high hydric demands and poikilohydric nature of mosses. Our results are consistent with population adaptation to local climate, and suggest that intraspecific variation among populations can have important effects on the response of species to microclimate drivers. These findings highlight the need to account for differential responses in predictions of species abundance and distribution under climate change.

AB The pooling of soil samples in plant-microbe interaction studies is commonly employed, but the impact of sample handling has rarely been explored experimentally. Concerns have been raised that sample pooling may reduce biological variation leading to inflated type I errors or may alter the magnitude of microbial effects observed, invalidating the results achieved. To assess the impact of inocula pooling on plant-microbe interactions, we examined the reciprocal influence of unpooled and pooled soil microbial inocula on growth of Solidago altissima and Schizachyrium scoparium, with and without inoculum sterilization. Soil pooling had no effect on the variance among replicates in either plant species. However, pooling dramatically altered the magnitude and direction of microbial impacts on plant performance. Pooling of Solidago altissima soil increased the antagonistic effects on growth of both target species. In contrast, pooling of Schizachyrium scoparium soil shifted impacts on Solidago altissima from effectively neutral to slightly positive. Pooling in this system altered both the strength and direction of plant-microbe interactions relative to unpooled soils. Therefore soil mixing should be avoided when the research goal is to determine naturally occurring interaction strengths, even within a single habitat.

AB Predators can increase the biomass of their prey, particularly when prey life stages differ in competitive ability and predation is stage specific. Akin to predators, parasites influence host population sizes and engage in stage-structured interactions, yet whether parasites can increase host population biomass remains relatively unexplored. Using a stage-structured consumer-resource model and a mesocosm experiment with snails and castrating trematodes, we examined responses of host biomass to changes in infection prevalence under variation in host pathology and resource competition. Equilibrium adult host biomass increased with infection prevalence in the model when parasites castrated hosts and adults were superior competitors to juveniles. Juvenile biomass increased with infection prevalence whether parasites caused mortality or castration, but only when juveniles were superior competitors. In mesocosms, increases in infection by castrating trematodes reduced snail egg production, juvenile abundance, and adult survival. At high competition, juvenile growth and total biomass increased with infection prevalence due to competitive release. At low competition, juvenile biomass decreased with infection due to reduced reproduction. These results highlight how disease-induced biomass overcompensation depends on infection pathology, resource availability, and competitive interactions within and between host life stages. Considering such characteristics may benefit biocontrol efforts using parasites.

AB The competitive exclusion principle is one of the oldest ideas in ecology and states that without additional self-limitation two predators cannot coexist on a single prey. The search for mechanisms allowing coexistence despite this has identified niche differentiation between predators as crucial: without this, coexistence requires the predators to have exactly the same R* values, which is considered impossible. However, this reasoning misses a critical point: predators' R* values are not static properties, but affected by defensive traits of their prey, which in turn can adapt in response to changes in predator densities. Here I show that this feedback between defense and predator dynamics enables stable predator coexistence without ecological niche differentiation. Instead, the mechanism driving coexistence is that prey adaptation causes defense to converge to the value where both predators have equal R* values ("fitness equalization"). This result is highly general, independent of specific model details, and applies to both rapid defense evolution and inducible defenses. It demonstrates the importance of considering long-standing ecological questions from an eco-evolutionary viewpoint, and showcases how the effects of adaptation can cascade through communities, driving diversity on higher trophic levels. These insights offer an important new perspective on coexistence theory.

AB Although studies have shown that mammalian herbivores often limit aboveground carbon storage in savannas, their effects on belowground soil carbon storage remain unclear. Using three sets of long-term, large herbivore exclosures with paired controls, we asked how almost two decades of herbivore removal from a semiarid savanna in Laikipia, Kenya affected aboveground (woody and grass) and belowground soil carbon sequestration, and determined the major source (C-3 vs. C-4) of belowground carbon sequestered in soils with and without herbivores present. Large herbivore exclusion, which included a diverse community of grazers, browsers, and mixed-feeding ungulates, resulted in significant increases in grass cover (similar to 22%), woody basal area (similar to 8 m(2)/ha), and woody canopy cover (31%), translating to a similar to 8.5 t/ha increase in aboveground carbon over two decades. Herbivore exclusion also led to a 54% increase (20.5 t/ha) in total soil carbon to 30-cm depth, with similar to 71% of this derived from C-4 grasses (vs. similar to 76% with herbivores present) despite substantial increases in woody cover. We attribute this continued high contribution of C-4 grasses to soil C sequestration to the reduced offtake of grass biomass with herbivore exclusion together with the facilitative influence of open sparse woody canopies (e.g., Acacia spp.) on grass cover and productivity in this semiarid system.

AB Foundation species structure communities, promote biodiversity, and stabilize ecosystem processes by creating locally stable environmental conditions. Despite their critical importance, the role of foundation species in stabilizing natural communities has seldom been quantified. In theory, the stability of a foundation species should promote community stability by enhancing species richness, altering the population fluctuations of individual species, or both. Here we tested the hypothesis that the stability of a marine foundation species, the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, increased the stability of the aggregate biomass of a phylogenetically diverse assemblage of understory algae and sessile invertebrates that compete for space beneath the giant kelp canopy. To achieve this goal, we analyzed an 18-yr time series of the biomass of giant kelp and its associated benthic community collected from 32 plots distributed among nine shallow reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel, USA. We showed that the stability of understory algae and sessile invertebrates was positively and indirectly related to the stability of giant kelp, which primarily resulted from giant kelp's direct positive association with species richness. The stability of all community types was positively related to species richness via increased species stability and species asynchrony. The stabilizing effects of richness were three to four times stronger when algae and invertebrates were considered separately rather than in combination. Our finding that diversity-stability relationships were stronger in communities consisting of species with similar resource requirements suggests that competition for shared resources rather than differential responses to environmental conditions played a more important role in stabilizing the community. Increasing threats to structure-forming foundation species worldwide necessitates a detailed understanding of how they influence their associated community. This study is among the first to show that dampened temporal fluctuations in the biomass of a foundation species is an important determinant of the stability of the complex communities it supports.

AB Early successional tropical forests could mitigate climate change via rapid accumulation of atmospheric carbon. However, liana (woody vine) abundance and biomass has been increasing in many tropical forests over the past decades, which may slow the speed at which secondary forests accumulate biomass. Lianas decrease biomass accumulation in tropical forests, and may have a particularly strong effect on young forests by stalling tree growth. As forests mature, trees may outgrow or shed lianas, thus escaping some of the negative effects of lianas. Alternatively, lianas may have the strongest effect in older successional forests if the effect of lianas is commensurate with their density, which increases dramatically in the first decades of forest succession. We tested these two hypotheses using a landscape liana-removal experiment in 30 forest stands that ranged from 10 to 35 yr old in Central Panama. We measured tree growth and biomass accumulation in the stands every year from 2014 to 2017. We found that the effect of liana removal on large trees (>= 20-cm diameter) decreased with forest age, supporting the hypothesis that lianas have the strongest negative effects on trees, and thus biomass uptake and carbon storage, in very young successional forests. Large trees accumulated more biomass in the absence of lianas in younger forests than in older forests (compared to controls) even after accounting for the effect of canopy completeness and crown illumination, implying that the detrimental effects of lianas go well beyond resource availability and crown health. There was no significant effect of lianas on small trees (1-20-cm diameter), likely because lianas seek light and thus do not deploy their leaves on small trees that are trapped in the forest understory. Our results show that high liana density early in forest succession reduces forest biomass accumulation by negatively impacting large trees, thus decreasing the capacity of young secondary forests to mitigate climate change. Although the negative effects of lianas on forest biomass diminish as forests age, they do not disappear, and thus lianas are an important component of tropical forest carbon budgets throughout succession.

AB The keystone roles of mega-fauna in many terrestrial ecosystems have been lost to defaunation. Large predators and herbivores often play keystone roles in their native ranges, and some have established invasive populations in new biogeographic regions. However, few empirical examples are available to guide expectations about how mega-fauna affect ecosystems in novel environmental and evolutionary contexts. We examined the impacts on aquatic ecosystems of an emerging population of hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibus) that has been growing in Colombia over the last 25 yr. Hippos in Africa fertilize lakes and rivers by grazing on land and excreting wastes in the water. Stable isotopes indicate that terrestrial sources contribute more carbon in Colombian lakes containing hippo populations, and daily dissolved oxygen cycles suggest that their presence stimulates ecosystem metabolism. Phytoplankton communities were more dominated by cyanobacteria in lakes with hippos, and bacteria, zooplankton, and benthic invertebrate communities were similar regardless of hippo presence. Our results suggest that hippos recapitulate their role as ecosystem engineers in Colombia, importing terrestrial organic matter and nutrients with detectable impacts on ecosystem metabolism and community structure in the early stages of invasion. Ongoing range expansion may pose a threat to water resources.

AB Climatic extremes, such as severe drought, are expected to increase in frequency and magnitude with climate change. Thus, identifying mechanisms of resilience is critical to predicting the vulnerability of ecosystems. An exceptional drought (<first percentile) impacted much of southern Africa during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons, including the site of a long-term fire experiment in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Prior to the drought, experimental fire frequencies (annual, triennial, and unburned) created savanna grassland plant communities that differed in composition and function, providing a unique opportunity to assess ecosystem resilience mechanisms under different fire regimes. Surprisingly, aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) recovered fully in all fire frequencies the year after this exceptional drought. In burned sites, resilience was due mostly to annual forb ANPP compensating for reduced grass ANPP. In unburned sites, resilience of total and grass ANPP was due to subdominant annual and perennial grass species facilitating recovery in ANPP after mortality of other common grasses. This was possible because of high evenness among grass species in unburned sites predrought. These findings highlight the importance of both functional diversity and within-functional group evenness as mechanisms of ecosystem resilience to extreme drought.

AB Human induced climate and land-use change are severely impacting global biodiversity, but how community composition and richness of multiple taxonomic groups change in response to local drivers and whether these responses are synchronous remains unclear. We used long-term community-level data from an experimentally manipulated grassland to assess the relative influence of climate and land use as drivers of community structure of four taxonomic groups: birds, mammals, grasshoppers, and plants. We also quantified the synchrony of responses among taxonomic groups across land-use gradients and compared climatic drivers of community structure across groups. All four taxonomic groups responded strongly to land use (fire frequency and grazing), while responses to climate variability were more pronounced in grasshoppers and small mammals. Animal groups exhibited asynchronous responses across all land-use treatments, but plant and animal groups, especially birds, exhibited synchronous responses in composition. Asynchrony was attributed to taxonomic groups responding to different components of climate variability, including both current climate conditions and lagged effects from the previous year. Data-driven land management strategies are crucial for sustaining native biodiversity in grassland systems, but asynchronous responses of taxonomic groups to climate variability across land-use gradients highlight a need to incorporate response heterogeneity into management planning.

AB Resource selection is often studied by ecologists interested in the environmental drivers of animal space use and movement. These studies commonly produce spatial predictions, which are of considerable utility to resource managers making habitat and population management decisions. It is thus paramount that predictions from resource selection studies are accurate. We evaluated model building and fitting strategies for optimizing resource selection function predictions in a use-availability framework. We did so by simulating low- and high-intensity spatial sampling data that respectively predicted study area and movement-based resource selection. We compared one of the most commonly used forms of statistical regularization, Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), with the lesser used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). LASSO predictions were less variable and more accurate than AIC and were often best when considering additive and interacting variables. We explicitly demonstrate the predictive equivalence using the logistic and Poisson likelihoods and how it is lost when the available sample is too small. Regardless of modeling approach, interpreting the sign of coefficients as a measure of selection can be misleading when optimizing for prediction.

AB Deforestation and land-use change in tropical regions result in habitat loss and extinction of species that are unable to adapt to the conditions in agricultural landscapes. If the associated loss of functional diversity is not compensated by species colonizing the converted habitats, extinctions might be followed by a reduction or loss of ecosystem functions including biological control. To date, little is known about how land-use change in the tropics alters the functional diversity of invertebrate predators and which key environmental factors may mitigate the decline in functional diversity and predation in litter and soil communities. We applied litter sieving and heat extraction to study ground spider communities and assessed structural characteristics of vegetation and parameters of litter in rainforest and agricultural land-use systems (jungle rubber, rubber, and oil palm monocultures) in a Southeast Asian hotspot of rainforest conversion: Sumatra, Indonesia. We found that (1) spider density, species richness, functional diversity, and community predation (energy flux to spiders) were reduced by 57-98% from rainforest to oil palm monoculture; (2) jungle rubber and rubber monoculture sustained relatively high diversity and predation in ground spiders, but small cryptic spider species strongly declined; (3) high species turnover compensated losses of some functional trait combinations, but did not compensate for the overall loss of functional diversity and predation per unit area; (4) spider diversity was related to habitat structure such as amount of litter, understory density, and understory height, while spider predation was better explained by plant diversity. Management practices that increase habitat-structural complexity and plant diversity such as mulching, reduced weeding, and intercropping monocultures with other plants may contribute to maintaining functional diversity of and predation services provided by ground invertebrate communities in plantations.

AB Increasing ocean temperatures have widespread consequences for coral reefs, one of which is coral bleaching. We analyzed a global network of associations between coral species and Symbiodiniaceae for resistance to temperature stress and robustness to perturbations. Null networks were created by changing either the physiological parameters of the nodes or the structures of the networks. We developed a bleaching model in which each link, association, is given a weight based on temperature thresholds for specific host-symbiont pairs and links are removed as temperature increases. Resistance to temperature stress was determined from the response of the networks to the bleaching model. Ecological robustness, defined by how much perturbation is needed to decrease the number of nodes by 50%, was determined for multiple removal models that considered traits of the hosts, symbionts, and their associations. Network resistance to bleaching and robustness to perturbations differed from the null networks and varied across spatial scales, supporting that thermal tolerances, local association patterns, and environment play an important role in network persistence. Networks were more robust to attacks on associations than to attacks on species. Although the global network was fairly robust to random link removals, when links are removed according to the bleaching model, robustness decreases by about 20%. Specific environmental attacks, in the form of increasing temperatures, destabilize the global network of coral species and Symbiodiniaceae. On a global scale, the network was more robust to removals of links with susceptible Symbiodiniaceae than it was to removals of links with susceptible hosts. Thus, the symbionts convey more stability to the symbiosis than the hosts when the system is under an environmental attack. However, our results also provide evidence that the environment of the networks affects robustness to link perturbations. Our work shows that ecological resistance and robustness can be assessed through network analysis that considers specific biological traits and functional weaknesses. The global network of associations between corals and Symbiodiniaceae and its distribution of thermal tolerances are non-random, and the evolution of this architecture has led to higher sensitivity to environmental perturbations.

AB Dispersal evolves as an adaptive mechanism to optimize individual fitness across the landscape. Specifically, dispersal represents a mechanism to escape fitness costs resulting from changes in environmental conditions. Decades of empirical work suggest that individuals use local habitat cues to make movement decisions, but theory predicts that dispersal can also evolve as a fixed trait, independent of local conditions, in environments characterized by a history of stochastic spatiotemporal variation. Until now, however, both conditional and fixed models of dispersal evolution have primarily been evaluated using emigration data (stay vs. leave), and not dispersal distances: a more comprehensive measure of dispersal. Our goal was to test whether conditional or fixed models of dispersal evolution predict variation in dispersal distance in the stream salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus. We quantified variation in habitat conditions using measures of salamander performance from 4 yr of spatially explicit, capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data across three headwater streams in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in central New Hampshire, USA. We used body condition as an index of local habitat quality that individuals may use to make dispersal decisions, and survival probability estimated from multistate CMR models as an index of mortality risk resulting from the long-term history of environmental variation. We found that dispersal distances increased with declining survival probability, indicating that salamanders disperse further in risky environments. Dispersal distances were unrelated to spatial variation in body condition, suggesting that salamanders do not base dispersal distance decisions on local habitat quality. Our study provides the first empirical support for fixed models of dispersal evolution, which predict that dispersal evolves in response to a history of spatiotemporal environmental variation, rather than as a conditional response to current habitat conditions. More broadly, this study underscores the value of assessing alternative scales of environmental variation to gain a more complete and balanced understanding of dispersal evolution.

AB Complex ecological relationships, such as host-parasite interactions, are often modeled with laboratory experiments. However, some experimental laboratory conditions, such as temperature or infection dose, are regularly chosen based on convenience or convention, and it is unclear how these decisions systematically affect experimental outcomes. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of 58 laboratory studies that exposed amphibians to the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) to understand better how laboratory temperature, host life stage, infection dose, and host species affect host mortality. We found that host mortality was driven by thermal mismatches: hosts native to cooler environments experienced greater Bd-induced mortality at relatively warm experimental temperatures and vice versa. We also found that Bd dose positively predicted Bd-induced host mortality and that the superfamilies Bufonoidea and Hyloidea were especially susceptible to Bd. Finally, the effect of Bd on host mortality varied across host life stages, with larval amphibians experiencing lower risk of Bd-induced mortality than adults or metamorphs. Metamorphs were especially susceptible and experienced mortality when inoculated with much smaller Bd doses than the average dose used by researchers. Our results suggest that when designing experiments on species interactions, researchers should carefully consider the experimental temperature, inoculum dose, and life stage, and taxonomy of the host species.

AB Forests are the most diverse and productive terrestrial ecosystems on Earth, so sustainably managing them for the future is a major global challenge. Yet, our understanding of forest diversity relies almost exclusively on the study of trees. Here, we demonstrate unequivocally that other growth forms (shrubs, lianas, herbs, epiphytes) make up the majority of vascular plant species in both tropical and temperate forests. By comparing the relative distribution of species richness among plant growth forms for over 3,400 species in 18 forests in the Americas, we construct the first high-resolution quantification of plant growth form diversity across two ecologically important regions at a near-continental scale. We also quantify the physical distribution of plant species among forest layers, that is, where among the vertical strata plants ultimately live their adult lives, and show that plants are strongly downshifted in temperate forests vs. tropical forests. Our data illustrate a previously unquantified fundamental difference between tropical and temperate forests: what plant growth forms are most speciose, and where they ultimately live in the forest. Recognizing these differences requires that we re-focus ecological research and forest management plans to encompass a broader suite of plant growth forms. This more holistic perspective is essential to conserve global biodiversity.

AB Animals are often the primary dispersers of seeds and fungal spores. Specialist species that consume fruits or fungal fruiting bodies (sporocarps) as their main food source are thought to play a more important role in dispersal networks compared to generalist species. However, dispersal networks are often based on occurrence data, overlooking the influence of animal abundance and dispersal effectiveness on network interactions. Using rodent-mycorrhizal fungi networks, we determined how diet specialization and abundance influence the role of rodent species in dispersing fungal spores in temperate forests of northern New Hampshire, USA. We tracked the interactions of five rodent species and 34 fungal taxa over a 3-yr period across hardwood, mixed, and softwood forest stands. We accounted for fluctuations in rodent abundance and differences in the number of spores dispersed in rodent scat. Myodes gapperi, a fungal specialist, dispersed a more diverse spore community than rodent generalists and was consistently the most important disperser in forest types with high fungal availability. Nevertheless, during years when generalist species such as Tamias striatus and Peromyscus maniculatus reached high abundance, their relative importance (species strength) in networks approached or even surpassed that of M. gapperi, particularly in forest types where M. gapperi was less common and fungal availability was low. Increased numbers of generalists enhanced network interaction diversity and the number of fungal taxa dispersed, the timing of which was coincident with seedling establishment following masting, a stage when inoculation by mycorrhizal fungi is critical for growth and survival. Our findings suggest that although specialists play key roles in dispersing mycorrhizal fungal spores, generalists play a heretofore underappreciated role.

AB Whole microbial communities regularly merge with one another, often in tandem with their environments, in a process called community coalescence. Such events impose substantial changes: abiotic perturbation from environmental blending and biotic perturbation of community merging. We used an aquatic mixing experiment to unravel the effects of these perturbations on the whole microbiome response and on the success of individual taxa when distinct freshwater and marine communities coalesce. We found that an equal mix of freshwater and marine habitats and blended microbiomes resulted in strong convergence of the community structure toward that of the marine microbiome. The enzymatic potential of these blended microbiomes in mixed media also converged toward that of the marine, with strong correlations between the multivariate response patterns of the enzymes and of community structure. Exposing each endmember inocula to an axenic equal mix of their freshwater and marine source waters led to a 96% loss of taxa from our freshwater microbiomes and a 66% loss from our marine microbiomes. When both inocula were added together to this mixed environment, interactions amongst the communities led to a further loss of 29% and 49% of freshwater and marine taxa, respectively. Under both the axenic and competitive scenarios, the diversity lost was somewhat counterbalanced by increased abundance of microbial taxa that were too rare to detect in the initial inocula. Our study emphasizes the importance of the rare biosphere as a critical component of microbial community responses to community coalescence.

AB The recent development of human societies has led to major, rapid, and often inexorable changes in the environment of most animal species. Over the last decades, a growing number of studies formulated predictions on the modalities of animal adaptation to novel or changing environments, questioning how and at what speed animals should adapt to such changes, discussing the levels of risks imposed by changes in the mean and/or variance of temperatures on animal performance, and exploring the underlying roles of phenotypic plasticity and genetic inheritance. These fundamental predictions, however, remain poorly tested using field data. Here, we tested these predictions using a unique continental-scale data set in the European earwig Forficula auricularia L., a univoltine insect introduced in North America one century ago. We conducted a common garden experiment, in which we measured 13 life-history traits in 4,158 field-sampled earwigs originating from 19 populations across North America. Our results first demonstrate that 10 of the 13 measured life-history traits are associated with two sets of variations in seasonal temperatures, that is, winter-summer and autumn-spring. We found, however, no association with the overall mean monthly temperatures of the invaded locations. Furthermore, our use of a common garden setup reveals that the observed patterns of variation in earwigs' life-history traits are not mere plastic responses to their current environment, but are either due to their genetic background and/or to the environmental conditions they experienced during early life development. Overall, these findings provide continent-scale support to the claims that adaptation to thermal changes can occur quickly (in less than 100 generations), even in insects with long life cycles, and emphasize the importance of variation in seasonal temperature over mean population temperatures in climate adaptation.

AB Functional responses describe how consumer foraging rates change with resource density. Despite extensive research looking at the factors underlying foraging interactions, there remains ongoing controversy about how temperature and body size control the functional response parameters space clearance (or attack) rate and handling time. Here, we investigate the effects of temperature, consumer mass, and resource mass using the largest compilation of functional responses yet assembled. This compilation contains 2,083 functional response curves covering a wide range of foragers and prey types, environmental conditions, and habitats. After accounting for experimental arena size, dimensionality of the foraging interaction, and consumer taxon, we find that both space clearance rate and handling time are optimized at intermediate temperatures (a unimodal rather than monotonic response), suggesting that the response to global climate change depends on the location of the consumer's current temperature relative to the optimum. We further confirm that functional responses are higher and steeper for large consumers and small resources, and models using consumer and resource masses separately outperformed models using consumer:resource mass ratios, suggesting that consumer and resource body mass act independently to set interaction strengths. Lastly, we show that the extent to which foraging is affected by temperature or mass depends on the taxonomic identity of the consumer and the dimensionality of the consumer-resource interaction. We thus argue that although overall body size and temperature effects can be identified, they are not universal, and therefore food web and community modeling approaches could be improved by considering taxonomic identity along with body size and unimodal temperature effects.

AB Apex predators can have substantial and complex ecological roles in ecosystems. However, differences in species-specific traits, population densities, and interspecific interactions are likely to determine the strength of apex predators' roles. Here we report complementary studies examining how interactions between predator per capita metabolic rate and population density influenced the biomass, population energy use, and ecological effects of apex predators on their large mammalian prey. We first investigated how large mammal prey resources and field metabolic rates of terrestrial apex predators, comprising large mammals and the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), influenced their biomass densities and population energy use requirements. We next evaluated whether Komodo dragons, like apex mammalian predators, exerted top-down regulation of their large mammal prey. Comparison of results from field studies demonstrates that Komodo dragons attain mean population biomass densities that are 5.75-231.82 times higher than that of apex mammalian predator species and their guilds in Africa, Asia, and North America. The high biomass of Komodo dragons resulted in 1.96-108.12 times greater population energy use than that of apex mammalian predators. Nevertheless, substantial temporal and spatial variation in Komodo dragon population energy use did not regulate the population growth rates of either of two large mammal prey species, rusa deer (Rusa timorensis) and wild pig (Sus scrofa). We suggest that multiple processes weaken the capacity of Komodo dragons to regulate large mammal prey populations. For example, a low per capita metabolic rate requiring an infrequent and inactive hunting strategy (including scavenging), would minimize lethal and nonlethal impacts on prey populations. We conclude that Komodo dragons differ in their predatory role from, including not being the ecological analogs of, apex mammalian predators.

AB Animal migrations are a fascinating and global phenomenon, yet they are often difficult to study and sometimes poorly understood. Here, we build on classic ecological theory by hypothesizing that some enigmatic spawning migrations across coastal marine habitats can be inferred from the population genetic signature of larval dispersal by ocean currents. We test this assumption by integrating spatially realistic simulations of alternative spawning migration routes, associated patterns of larval dispersal, and associated variation in the population genetic structure of eastern Australian sea mullet (Mugil cephalus). We then use simulation results to assess the implications of alternative spawning destinations for larval replenishment, and we contrast simulated against measured population genetic variation. Both analyses suggest that the spawning migrations of M. cephalus in eastern Australia are likely to be localized (approximately 100 km along the shore), and that spawning is likely to occur in inshore waters. Our conclusions are supported by multiple lines of evidence available through independent studies, but they challenge the more traditional assumption of a single, long-distance migration event with subsequent offshore spawning in the East Australian Current. More generally, our study operationalizes classic theory on the relationship between fish migrations, ocean currents, and reproductive success. However, rather than confirming the traditionally assumed adaptation of migratory behavior to dominant ocean current flow, our findings support the concept of a genetically measurable link between fish migrations and local oceanographic conditions, specifically water temperature and coastal retention of larvae. We believe that future studies using similar approaches for high resolution and spatially realistic ecological-genetic scenario testing can help rapidly advance our understanding of key ecological processes in many other marine species.

AB The color of many lakes and seas is changing, which is likely to affect the species composition of freshwater and marine phytoplankton communities. For example, cyanobacteria with phycobilisomes as light-harvesting antennae can effectively utilize green or orange-red light. However, recent studies show that they use blue light much less efficiently than phytoplankton species with chlorophyll-based light-harvesting complexes, even though both phytoplankton groups may absorb blue light to a similar extent. Can we advance ecological theory to predict how these differences in light-harvesting strategy affect competition between phytoplankton species? Here, we develop a new resource competition model in which the absorption and utilization efficiency of different colors of light are varied independently. The model was parameterized using monoculture experiments with a freshwater cyanobacterium and green alga, as representatives of phytoplankton with phycobilisome-based vs. chlorophyll-based light-harvesting antennae. The parameterized model was subsequently tested in a series of competition experiments. In agreement with the model predictions, the green alga won the competition in blue light whereas the cyanobacterium won in red light, irrespective of the initial relative abundances of the species. These results are in line with observed changes in phytoplankton community structure in response to lake brownification. Similarly, in marine waters, the model predicts dominance of Prochlorococcus with chlorophyll-based light-harvesting complexes in blue light but dominance of Synechococcus with phycobilisomes in green light, with a broad range of coexistence in between. These predictions agree well with the known biogeographical distributions of these two highly abundant marine taxa. Our results offer a novel trait-based approach to understand and predict competition between phytoplankton species with different photosynthetic pigments and light-harvesting strategies.

AB Identifying species interactions and detecting when ecological communities are structured by them is an important problem in ecology and biogeography. Ecologists have developed specialized statistical hypothesis tests to detect patterns indicative of community-wide processes in their field data. In this respect, null model approaches have proved particularly popular. The freedom allowed in choosing the null model and statistic to construct a hypothesis test leads to a proliferation of possible hypothesis tests from which ecologists can choose to detect these processes. Here, we point out some serious shortcomings of a popular approach to choosing the best hypothesis for the ecological problem at hand that involves benchmarking different hypothesis tests by assessing their performance on artificially constructed data sets. Terminological errors concerning the use of Type I and Type II errors that underlie these approaches are discussed. We argue that the key benchmarking methods proposed in the literature are not a sound guide for selecting null hypothesis tests, and further, that there is no simple way to benchmark null hypothesis tests. Surprisingly, the basic problems identified here do not appear to have been addressed previously, and these methods are still being used to develop and test new null models and summary statistics, from quantifying community structure (e.g., nestedness and modularity) to analyzing ecological networks.

AB Cyclic fluctuations in abundance exhibited by some mammalian populations in northern habitats ("population cycles") are key processes in the functioning of many boreal and tundra ecosystems. Understanding population cycles, essentially demographic processes, necessitates discerning the demographic mechanisms that underlie numerical changes. Using mark-recapture data spanning five population cycles (1977-2017), we examined demographic mechanisms underlying the 9-10-yr cycles exhibited by snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus Erxleben) in southwestern Yukon, Canada. Snowshoe hare populations always decreased during winter and increased during summer; the balance between winter declines and summer increases characterized the four, multiyear cyclic phases: increase, peak, decline, and low. Little or no recruitment occurred during winter, but summer recruitment varied markedly across the four phases with the highest and lowest recruitment observed during the increase and decline phase, respectively. Population crashes during the decline were triggered by a substantial decline in winter survival and by a lack of subsequent summer recruitment. In contrast, initiation of the increase phase was triggered by a twofold increase in summer recruitment abetted secondarily by improvements in subsequent winter survival. We show that differences in peak density across cycles are explained by differences in overall population growth rate, amount of time available for population growth to occur, and starting population density. Demographic mechanisms underlying snowshoe hare population cycles were consistent across cycles in our study site but we do not yet know if similar demographic processes underlie population cycles in other northern snowshoe hare populations.

AB Establishment and persistence are central to community assembly and are determined by how traits interact with the environment to determine performance (trait-environment interactions). Community assembly studies have rarely considered such trait-environment interactions, however, which can lead to incorrect inferences about how traits affect assembly. We evaluated how functional traits, environmental conditions, and trait-environment interactions structure plant establishment, as a measure of performance. Within 12 prairie restorations created by sowing 70 species, we quantified environmental conditions and counted individuals of each seeded species to quantify first-year establishment. Three trait-environment interactions structured establishment. Leaf nitrogen interacted with herbivore pressure, as low leaf nitrogen species established relatively better under higher herbivory than species with high leaf nitrogen. Soil moisture interacted with root mass fraction (RMF), with low-RMF species establishing better with low soil moisture and higher-RMF species better on wetter soils. Specific leaf area (SLA) interacted with light availability, as low-SLA species established better under high light conditions and high-SLA species under low light conditions. Our work illustrates how community assembly can be better described by trait-environment interactions than correlating traits or environment with performance. This knowledge can assist species selection to maximize restoration success.

AB Despite overall global declines, mangroves are expanding into and within many subtropical wetlands, leading to heterogeneous cover of marsh-mangrove coastal vegetation communities near the poleward edge of mangroves' ranges. Coastal wetlands are globally important carbon sinks, yet the effects of shifts in mangrove cover on organic-carbon (OC) storage remains uncertain. We experimentally maintained black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) or marsh vegetation in patches (n = 1,120, 3 x 3 m) along a gradient in mangrove cover (0-100%) within coastal wetland plots (n = 10, 24 x 42 m) and measured changes in OC stocks and fluxes. Within patches, above and belowground biomass (OC) was 1,630% and 61% greater for mangroves than for recolonized marshes, and soil OC was 30% greater beneath mangrove than marsh vegetation. At the plot scale, above and belowground biomass increased linearly with mangrove cover but soil OC was highly variable and unrelated to mangrove cover. Root ingrowth was not different in mangrove or marsh patches, nor did it change with mangrove cover. After 11 months, surface OC accretion was negatively related to plot-scale mangrove cover following a high-wrack deposition period. However, after 22 months, accretion was 54% higher in mangrove patches, and there was no relationship to plot-scale mangrove cover. Marsh (Batis maritima) leaf and root litter had 1,000% and 35% faster breakdown rates (k) than mangrove (A. germinans) leaf and root litter. Soil temperatures beneath mangroves were 1.4 degrees C lower, decreasing aboveground k of fast- (cellulose) and slow-decomposing (wood) standard substrates. Wood k in shallow soil (0-15 cm) was higher in mangrove than marsh patches, but vegetation identity did not impact k in deeper soil (15-30 cm). We found that mangrove cover enhanced OC storage by increasing biomass, creating more recalcitrant organic matter and reducing k on the soil surface by altering microclimate, despite increasing wood k belowground and decreasing allochthonous OC subsidies. Our results illustrate the importance of mangroves in maintaining coastal OC storage, but also indicate that the impacts of vegetation change on OC storage may vary based on ecosystem conditions, organic-matter sources, and the relative spatiotemporal scales of mangrove vegetation change.

AB Social information obtained from heterospecifics can enhance individual fitness by reducing environmental uncertainty, making it an important driver of mixed-species grouping behavior. Heterospecific groups are well documented among fishes, yet are notably more prevalent among juveniles than more advanced life stages, implying that the adaptive value of joining other species is greater during this developmental period. We propose this phenomenon can be explained by the heightened ecological relevance of heterospecifically produced cues pertaining to predation risk and or resources, as body-size uniformity inherent in early ontogeny yields greater overlap in predator and prey guild membership across juveniles of disparate taxa. To evaluate the putative role of information in shaping juvenile fish assemblages, we employed a joint species distribution model (JSDM), identifying nonrandom relationships among fishes collected in 785 seine hauls within the shallow littoral zones of a subtropical island. After accounting for species-environment relationships, which explained 39% of observed covariation in the abundance of 11 taxa, we detected high rates of positive association (84% of significant correlations) predominantly between mutual foraging guild members, consistent with assemblage patterns predicted to evolve under widespread interspecific information use. Affiliations occurred primarily between species characterized by neutral (i.e., noninteracting) or negative (i.e., predator-prey) relationships in later life stages, supporting the notion that heightened niche overlap due to body size homogeneity acted to increase the pertinence of information among juveniles. Taxa exerted varying degrees of influence on assemblage structure; however Eucinostomus spp., a gregarious generalist with exceptional information-production potential, had an effect several times that of all other species combined, further evidencing the likely role of information in motivating observed relationships. Co-occurrence and qualitative behavioral data inferred from remote underwater video surveys reinforced these conclusions. Collectively, these results suggest that positive interactions linked to information exchange can be among the principal factors organizing juvenile fish assemblages at local scales, highlighting the role of ontogeny in mediating the relevance and exploitation of information across species.

AB A major goal in ecology is to understand mechanisms that influence patterns of biodiversity and community assembly at various spatial and temporal scales. Understanding how community composition is created and maintained also is critical for natural resource management and biological conservation. In this study, we investigated environmental and spatial factors influencing beta diversity of local fish assemblages along the longitudinal gradient of a nearly pristine Neotropical river in the Colombian Llanos. Standardized surveys were conducted during the low-water season at 34 sites within the Bita River Basin. Physical, chemical, and landscape parameters were recorded at each site, and asymmetric eigenvector maps were used as spatial variables. To examine the relative influence of dispersal and environmental variables on beta diversity and its components, distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA) and variation partitioning analysis were conducted. We proposed that spatial scale of analysis and position within the river network would constrain patterns of beta diversity in different ways. However, results indicated that in this system, high beta diversity was consistent among species assemblages no matter the scale of analysis or position within the river network. Species replacement (turnover) dominated beta diversity, an indication of the importance of species sorting. These findings suggested that conservation of fish diversity in tropical rivers requires maintenance of both habitat heterogeneity (spatial variation in habitat conditions) and connectivity at the scale of entire river basins.

AB Warming can alter the biogeochemistry and ecology of soils. These alterations can be particularly large in high northern latitude ecosystems, which are experiencing the most intense warming globally. In this meta-analysis, we investigated global trends in how experimental warming is altering the biogeochemistry of the most common limiting nutrient for biological processes in cold ecosystems of high northern latitudes (>50 degrees): nitrogen (N). For comparison, we also analyzed cold ecosystems at intermediate and high southern latitudes. In addition, we examined N-relevant genes and enzymes, and the abundance of belowground organisms. Together, our findings suggest that warming in cold ecosystems increases N mineralization rates and N2O emissions and does not affect N fixation, at least not in a consistent way across biomes and conditions. Changes in belowground N fluxes caused by warming lead to an accumulation of N in the forms of dissolved organic and root N. These changes seem to be more closely linked to increases in enzyme activity that target relatively labile N sources, than to changes in the abundance of N-relevant genes (e.g., amoA and nosZ). Finally, our analysis suggests that warming in cold ecosystems leads to an increase in plant roots, fungi, and (likely in an indirect way) fungivores, and does not affect the abundance of archaea, bacteria, or bacterivores. In summary, our findings highlight global trends in the ways warming is altering the biogeochemistry and ecology of soils in cold ecosystems, and provide information that can be valuable for prediction of changes and for management of such ecosystems.

AB Tropical forests hold 30% of Earth's terrestrial carbon and at least 60% of its terrestrial biodiversity, but forest loss and degradation are jeopardizing these ecosystems. Although the regrowth of secondary forests has the potential to offset some of the losses of carbon and biodiversity, it remains unclear if secondary regeneration will be affected by climate changes such as higher temperatures and more frequent extreme droughts. We used a data set of 10 repeated forest inventories spanning two decades (1999-2017) to investigate carbon and tree species recovery and how climate and landscape context influence carbon dynamics in an older secondary forest located in one of the oldest post-Columbian agricultural frontiers in the Brazilian Amazon. Carbon accumulation averaged 1.08 Mg center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1), and species richness was effectively constant over the studied period. Moreover, we provide evidence that secondary forests are vulnerable to drought stress: Carbon balance and growth rates were lower in drier periods. This contrasts with drought responses in primary forests, where changes in carbon dynamics are driven by increased stem mortality. These results highlight an important climate change-vegetation feedback, whereby the increasing dry-season lengths being observed across parts of Amazonia may reduce the effectiveness of secondary forests in sequestering carbon and mitigating climate change. In addition, the current rate of forest regrowth in this region was low compared with previous pan-tropical and Amazonian assessments-our secondary forests reached just 41.1% of the average carbon and 56% of the tree diversity in the nearest primary forests-suggesting that these areas are unlikely to return to their original levels on politically meaningful time scales.

AB Sex ratios are commonly skewed and variable in wild populations, but few studies track temporal trends in this demographic parameter. We examined variation in the operational sex ratio at two protected and declining breeding colonies of Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) in Chubut, Argentina. Penguins from the two colonies, separated by 105 km, migrate north in the non-breeding season and have overlapping distributions at sea. Conditions during the non-breeding season can impact long-term trends in operational sex ratio (i.e., through sex-specific survival) and interannual variation in operational sex ratio (i.e., through sex-specific breeding decisions). We found an increasingly male-biased operational sex ratio at the two disparate colonies of Magellanic Penguins, which may contribute to continued population decline. We also found that the two colonies showed synchronous interannual variation in operational sex ratio, driven by variation in the number of females present each year. This pattern may be linked to sex-specific overwintering effects that cause females to skip breeding, i.e., to remain at sea rather than returning to the colony to breed, more often than males. Contrary to our predictions, colony-wide reproductive success was not lower in years with a more male-biased operational sex ratio. We did find that males showed more evidence of fighting and were less likely to pair when the operational sex ratio was more male biased. Our results highlight an indirect mechanism through which variation in the operational sex ratio can influence populations, through a higher incidence of fighting among the less abundant sex. Because biased sex ratios can reduce the size of the breeding population and influence rates of conflict, tracking operational sex ratio is critical for conservation.

AB Plant germination ecology involves continuous interactions between changing environmental conditions and the sensitivity of seed populations to respond to those conditions at a given time. Ecologically meaningful parameters characterizing germination capacity (or dormancy) are needed to advance our understanding of the evolution of germination strategies within plant communities. The germination traits commonly examined (e.g., maximum germination percentage under optimal conditions) may not adequately reflect the critical ecological differences in germination behavior across species, communities, and seasons. In particular, most seeds exhibit primary dormancy at dispersal that is alleviated by exposure to dry after-ripening or to hydrated chilling to enable germination in a subsequent favorable season. Population-based threshold (PBT) models of seed germination enable quantification of patterns of germination timing using parameters based on mechanistic assumptions about the underlying germination physiology. We applied the hydrothermal time (HTT) model, a type of PBT model that integrates environmental temperature and water availability, to study germination physiology in a guild of coexisting desert annual species whose seeds were after-ripened by dry storage under different conditions. We show that HTT assumptions are valid for describing germination physiology in these species, including loss of dormancy during after-ripening. Key HTT parameters, the hydrothermal time constant (theta(HT)) and base water potential distribution among seeds (psi(b)(g)), were effective in describing changes in dormancy states and in clustering species exhibiting similar germination syndromes. theta(HT) is an inherent species-specific trait relating to timing of germination that correlates well with long-term field germination fraction, while psi(b)(g) shifts with depth of dormancy in response to after-ripening and seasonal environmental variation. Predictions based on variation among coexisting species in theta(HT) and psi(b)(g) in laboratory germination tests matched well with 25-yr observations of germination dates and fractions for the same species in natural field conditions. Seed dormancy and germination strategies, which are significant contributors to long-term species demographics under natural conditions, can be represented by readily measurable functional traits underlying variation in germination phenologies.

AB Natural ecosystems provide humans with different types of ecosystem services, often linked to biodiversity. The dilution effect (DE) predicts a negative relationship between biodiversity and risk of infectious diseases of humans, other animals, and plants. We hypothesized that a stronger DE would be observed in studies conducted at smaller spatial scales, where biotic drivers may predominate, compared to studies at larger spatial scales where abiotic drivers may more strongly affect disease patterns. In addition, we hypothesized a stronger DE in studies from temperate regions at mid latitudes than in those from subtropical and tropical regions, due to more diffuse species interactions at low latitudes. To explore these hypotheses, we conducted a meta-analysis of observational studies of diversity-disease relationships for animals across spatial scales and geographic regions. Negative diversity-disease relationships were significant at small (combined site and local), intermediate (combined landscape and regional), and large (combined continental and global) scales and the effect did not differ depending on size of the study areas. For the geographic region analysis, a strongly negative diversity-disease relationship was found in the temperate region while no effect was found in the subtropical and tropical regions. However, no overall effect of absolute latitude on the strength of the dilution effect was detected. Our results suggest that a negative diversity-disease relationship occurs across scales and latitudes and is especially strong in the temperate region. These findings may help guide future management efforts in lowering disease risk.

AB Many plant and fungal species use volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as chemical signals to convey information about the location or quality of their fruits or fruiting bodies to animal dispersers. Identifying the environmental factors and biotic interactions that shape fruit selection by animals is key to understanding the evolutionary processes that underpin chemical signaling. Using four Elaphomyces truffle species, we explored the role of fruiting depth, VOC emissions, and protein content in selection by five rodent species. We used stable isotope analysis of nitrogen (delta N-15) in truffles to estimate fruiting depth, proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry to determine volatile emission composition, and nitrogen concentrations to calculate digestible protein of truffles. We coupled field surveys of truffle availability with truffle spore loads in rodent scat to determine selection by rodents. Despite presumably easier access to the shallow fruiting species, E. americanus (0.5-cm depth) and E. verruculosus (2.5-cm depth), most rodents selected for truffles fruiting deeper in the soil, E. macrosporus (4.1-cm depth) and E. bartlettii (5.0-cm depth). The deeper fruiting species had distinct VOC profiles and produced significantly higher quantities of odiferous compounds. Myodes gapperi (southern red-backed vole), a fungal specialist, also selected for truffles with high levels of digestible protein, E. verruculosus and E. macrosporus. Our results highlight the importance of chemical signals in truffle selection by rodents and suggest that VOCs are under strong selective pressures relative to protein rewards. Strong chemical signals likely allow detection of truffles deep within the soil and reduce foraging effort by rodents. For rodents that depend on fungi as a major food source, protein content may also be important in selecting truffles.

AB Mycorrhizal fungi have considerable effects on soil carbon (C) storage, as they control the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), by modifying the amount of soil nitrogen (N) available for free-living microbes. Through their access to organic N, ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi compete with free-living soil microbes; this competition is thought to slow down SOM decomposition. However, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi cannot decompose SOM, and therefore must wait for N to first be processed by free-living microbes. It is unclear what form of N the ECM fungi and free-living microbes compete for, or which microbial groups compete for N with ECM fungi. To investigate this, we focused on the N transformation steps (i.e., the degradation of high-molecular-weight organic matter, mineralization, and nitrification) and the microbes driving each step. Simple comparisons between AM forests and ECM forests are not sufficient to assert that mycorrhizal types would determine the N transformation steps in soil, because soil physiochemistry, which strongly affects N transformation steps, differs between the forests. We used an aridity gradient with large differences in soil moisture, pH, and SOM quantity and quality, to distinguish the mycorrhizal and physicochemical effects on N transformation. Soil samples (0-10 cm depth) were collected from AM-symbiotic black locust forests under three aridity levels, and from ECM-symbiotic oak forests under two aridity levels. Soil physicochemical properties, extractable N dynamics and abundance, composition, and function of soil microbial communities were measured. In ECM forests, the ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotic abundance was low, whereas that of ECM fungi was high, resulting in lower nitrate N content than in AM forests. Since ECM forests did not have lower saprotrophic fungal abundance and prokaryotic decompositional activity than the AM forests, the hypothesis that ECM fungi could reduce SOM decay and ammonification by free-living microbes, might not hold in ECM forests. However, the limitation of ECM fungi on nitrate N production would result in a feedback that will accelerate plant dependence on these fungi, thereby raising soil C storage through an increase in the ECM biomass and plant C investment in soils.

AB Following natural disturbances, additional anthropogenic disturbance may alter community recovery by affecting the occurrences of species, functional groups, and evolutionary lineages. However, our understanding of whether rare, common, or dominant species, functional groups, or evolutionary lineages are most strongly affected by an additional disturbance, particularly across multiple taxa, is limited. Here, we used a generalized diversity concept based on Hill numbers to quantify the community differences of vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens, wood-inhabiting fungi, saproxylic beetles, and birds in a storm-disturbed, experimentally salvage logged forest. Communities of all investigated species groups showed dissimilarities between logged and unlogged plots. Most species groups showed no significant changes in dissimilarities between logged and unlogged plots over the first seven years of succession, indicating a lack of community recovery. In general, the dissimilarities of communities were mainly driven by rare species. Convergence of dissimilarities occurred more often than divergence during the early stages of succession for rare species, indicating a major role in driving decreasing taxonomic dissimilarities between logged and unlogged plots over time. Trends in species dissimilarities only partially match the trends in dissimilarities of functional groups and evolutionary lineages, with little significant changes in successional trajectories. Nevertheless, common and dominant species contributed to a convergence of dissimilarities over time in the case of the functional dissimilarities of wood-inhabiting fungi. Our study shows that salvage logging following disturbances can alter successional trajectories in early stages of forest succession following natural disturbances. However, community changes over time may differ remarkably in different taxonomic groups and are best detected based on taxonomic, rather than functional or phylogenetic dissimilarities.

AB Two approaches have been classically used in disease ecology to estimate epidemiological parameters from field studies: cross-sectional sampling from unmarked individuals and longitudinal capture-recapture setups, which generally involve more limited numbers of marked individuals due to cost and logistical constraints. Although the benefits of longitudinal setups are increasingly acknowledged in the disease ecology community, cross-sectional data remain largely overrepresented in the literature, probably because of the inherent costs of longitudinal surveys. In this context, we used simulated data to compare the performances of cross-sectional and longitudinal designs to estimate the force of infection (i.e., the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected). Then, inspired from recent method developments in quantitative ecology, we explore the benefits of integrating both cross-sectional (seroprevalences) and longitudinal (individuals histories) data sets. In doing so, we investigate the effects of host species life history, antibody persistence, and degree of a priori knowledge and uncertainty on demographic and epidemiological parameters, as those are expected to affect in different ways the level of inference possible from the data. Our results highlight how those elements are important to consider in determining optimal sampling designs. In the case of long-lived species exposed to infectious agents resulting in persistent antibody responses, integrated designs are especially valuable as they benefit from the performances of longitudinal designs even with relatively small longitudinal sample sizes. As an illustration, we apply this approach to a combination of empirical and simulated data inspired from a case of bats exposed to a rabies virus. Overall, this work highlights that serology field studies could greatly benefit from the opportunity of integrating cross-sectional and longitudinal designs.

AB In many cooperatively breeding taxa, nonbreeding subordinates, or helpers, use extra-territorial forays to discover dispersal opportunities. Such forays are considered energetically costly and foraying birds face aggression from conspecific members of the territories they visit. In contrast, breeders in cooperatively breeding taxa are expected to foray seldomly. We used novel tracking technologies to follow 62 acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus), a cooperatively breeding bird, to study extra-territorial foray behavior. Both helpers and breeders engaged in extra-territorial forays routinely and often several times per day. Helpers forayed earlier in the day and invested more time when foraying to high-quality territories. Unexpectedly, breeders forayed as often and as far as helpers. Breeders from high-quality territories forayed closer to their home territories than breeders from low-quality territories, reflecting a potential trade-off between foraying and territory defense. Such a routine pattern of extra-territorial forays in both helpers and breeders suggests that the motives behind forays differ by sex and social status and involve more than simply searching for dispersal opportunities.

AB Biodiversity is defined by trait differences between organisms, and biologists have long sought to predict associations among ecologically important traits. Why do some traits trade off but others are coexpressed? Why might some trait associations hold across levels of organization, from individuals and genotypes to populations and species, whereas others only occur at one level? Understanding such scaling is a core biological problem, bearing on the evolution of ecological strategies as well as forecasting responses to environmental change. Explicitly considering the hierarchy of biodiversity and expectations at each scale (individual change, evolution within and among populations, and species turnover) is necessary as we work toward a predictive framework in evolutionary ecology. Within species, a trait may have an association with another trait because of phenotypic plasticity, genetic correlation, or population-level local adaptation. Plastic responses are often adaptive and yet individuals have a fixed pool of resources; thus, positive and negative trait associations can be generated by immediate environmental needs and energetic demands. Genetic variation and covariation for traits within a population are typically shaped by varying natural selection in space and time. Although genetic correlations are infrequently long-term constraints, they may indicate competing organismal demands. Traits are often quantitatively differentiated among populations (local adaptation), although selection rarely favors qualitatively different strategies until populations become reproductively isolated. Across species, niche specialization to particular habitats or biotic interactions may determine trait correlations, a subset of which are termed "strategic trade-offs" because they are a consequence of adaptive specialization. Across scales, constraints within species often do not apply as new species evolve, and conversely, trait correlations observed across populations or species may not be reflected within populations. I give examples of such scale-dependent trait associations and their causes across taxonomic groups and ecosystems, and in the final section of the paper, I specifically evaluate leaf economics spectrum traits and their associations with plant defense against herbivory. Scale-dependent predictions emerge for understanding plant ecology holistically, and this approach can be fruitfully applied more generally in evolutionary ecology. Adaptive specialization and community context are two of the primary drivers of trade-offs and syndromes across biological scales.

AB Recent studies have shown that invasive earthworms can dramatically reduce native biodiversity, both above and below the ground. However, we still lack a synthetic understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind these changes, such as whether earthworm effects on soil chemical properties drive such relationships. Here, we investigated the effects of invasive earthworms on soil chemical properties (pH, water content, and the stocks and fluxes of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) by conducting a meta-analysis. Invasive earthworms generally increased soil pH, indicating that the removal of organic layers and the upward transport of more base-rich mineral soil caused a shift in soil pH. Moreover, earthworms significantly decreased soil water content, suggesting that the burrowing activities of earthworms may have increased water infiltration of and/or increased evapotranspiration from soil. Notably, invasive earthworms had opposing effects on organic and mineral soil for carbon and nitrogen stocks, with decreases in organic, and increases in mineral soil. Nitrogen fluxes were higher in mineral soil, whereas fluxes in organic soil were not significantly affected by the presence of invasive earthworms, indicating that earthworms mobilize and redistribute nutrients among soil layers and increase overall nitrogen loss from the soil. Invasive earthworm effects on element stocks increased with ecological group richness only in organic soil. Earthworms further decreased ammonium stocks with negligible effects on nitrate stocks in organic soil, whereas they increased nitrate stocks but not ammonium stocks in mineral soil. Notably, all of these results were consistent across forest and grassland ecosystems underlining the generality of our findings. However, we found some significant differences between studies that were conducted in the field (observational and experimental settings) and in the lab, such as that the effects on soil pH decreased from field to lab settings, calling for a careful interpretation of lab findings. Our meta-analysis provides strong empirical evidence that earthworm invasion may lead to substantial changes in soil chemical properties and element cycling in soil. Furthermore, our results can help explain the dramatic effects of invasive earthworms on native biodiversity, for example, shifts towards the dominance of grass species over herbaceous ones, as shown by recent meta-analyses.

AB Future climate change is leading to the redistribution of life on Earth as species struggle to cope with rising temperatures. Local adaptation allows species to become locally optimized and persist despite environmental selection, but the extent to which this occurs in nature may be limited by dispersal and gene flow. Congeneric marine gastropod species (Littorina littorea and L. saxatilis) with markedly different developmental modes were collected from across a latitudinal thermal gradient to explore the prevalence of local adaptation to temperature. The acute response of metabolic rate (using oxygen consumption as a proxy) to up-ramping and down-ramping temperature regimes between 6 degrees C and 36 degrees C was quantified for five populations of each species. The highly dispersive L. littorea exhibited minimal evidence of local adaptation to the thermal gradient, with no change in thermal optimum (T-opt) or thermal breadth (T-br) and a decline in maximal performance ((max)) with increasing latitude. In contrast, the direct developing L. saxatilis displayed evidence of local optimization, although these varied idiosyncratically with latitude, suggesting a suite of selective pressures may be involved in shaping thermal physiology in this relatively sedentary species. Our results show that the biogeography of thermal traits can differ significantly between related species, and show that interpopulation differences in thermal performance do not necessarily follow simple patterns that may be predicted based on latitudinal changes in environmental temperatures. Further research is clearly required to understand the mechanisms that can lead to the emergence of local adaptation in marine systems better and allow improved predictions of species redistribution in response to climate change.

AB Corals of the eastern tropical Pacific live in a marginal and oceanographically dynamic environment. Along the Pacific coast of Panama, stronger seasonal upwelling in the Gulf of Panama in the east transitions to weaker upwelling in the Gulf of Chiriqui in the west, resulting in complex regional oceanographic conditions that drive differential coral-reef growth. Over millennial timescales, reefs in the Gulf of Chiriqui recovered more quickly from climatic disturbances compared with reefs in the Gulf of Panama. In recent decades, corals in the Gulf of Chiriqui have also had higher growth rates than in the Gulf of Panama. As the ocean continues to warm, however, conditions could shift to favor the growth of corals in the Gulf of Panama, where upwelling may confer protection from high-temperature anomalies. Here we describe the recent spatial and temporal variability in surface oceanography of nearshore environments in Pacific Panama and compare those conditions with the dynamics of contemporary coral-reef communities during and after the 2016 coral-bleaching event. Although both gulfs have warmed significantly over the last 150 yr, the annual thermal maximum in the Gulf of Chiriqui is increasing faster, and ocean temperatures there are becoming more variable than in the recent past. In contrast to historical trends, we found that coral cover, coral survival, and coral growth rates were all significantly higher in the Gulf of Panama. Corals bleached extensively in the Gulf of Chiriqui following the 2015-2016 El Nino event, whereas upwelling in the Gulf of Panama moderated the high temperatures caused by El Nino, allowing the corals largely to escape thermal stress. As the climate continues to warm, upwelling zones may offer a temporary and localized refuge from the thermal impacts of climate change, while reef growth in the rest of the eastern tropical Pacific continues to decline.

AB The paradoxical presence of toxic chemical compounds in ripe fruits represents a balance between plant enemies and allies: chemical traits can defend seeds against antagonistic herbivores, seed predators, or fungal pathogens, but also can impose costs by repelling mutualistic seed dispersers, although the costs are often difficult to quantify. Seeds gain fitness benefits from traveling far from the parent plant, as they can escape from parental competition and elude specialized herbivores as well as pathogens that accumulate on adult plants. However, seeds are difficult to follow from their parent plant to their final destination. Thus, little is known about the factors that determine seed dispersal distance. We investigated this potential cost of fruit secondary compounds, reduced seed dispersal distance, by combining two data sets from previous work on a Neotropical bat-plant dispersal system (bats in the genus Carollia and plants in the genus Piper). We used data from captive behavioral experiments, which show how amides in ripe fruits of Piper decrease the retention time of seeds and alter food choices. With new analyses, we show that these defensive secondary compounds also delay the time of fruit removal. Next, with a behaviorally annotated bat telemetry data set, we quantified post-feeding movements (i.e., seed dispersal distances). Using generalized additive mixed models we found that seed dispersal distances varied nonlinearly with gut retention times as well as with the time of fruit removal. By interrogating the model predictions, we identified two novel mechanisms by which fruit secondary compounds can impose costs in terms of decreased seed dispersal distances: (1) small-scale reductions in gut retention time and (2) causing fruits to forgo advantageous bat activity peaks that confer high seed dispersal distances.

AB Climate is one of the main factors driving species distributions and global biodiversity patterns. Obtaining accurate predictions of species' range shifts in response to ongoing climate change has thus become a key issue in ecology and conservation. Correlative species distribution models (cSDMs) have become a prominent tool to this aim in the last decade and have demonstrated good predictive abilities with current conditions, irrespective of the studied taxon. However, cSDMs rely on statistical association between species' presence and environmental conditions and have rarely been challenged on their actual capacity to reflect causal relationships between species and climate. In this study, we question whether cSDMs can accurately identify if climate and species distributions are causally linked, a prerequisite for accurate prediction of range shift in relation to climate change. We compared the performance of cSDMs in predicting the distributions of 132 European terrestrial species, chosen randomly within five taxonomic groups (three vertebrate groups and two plant groups), and of 1,320 virtual species whose distribution is causally fully independent from climate. We found that (1) for real species, the performance of cSDMs varied principally with range size, rather than with taxonomic groups and (2) cSDMs did not predict the distributions of real species with a greater accuracy than the virtual ones. Our results unambiguously show that the high predictive power of cSDMs can be driven by spatial autocorrelation in climatic and distributional data and does not necessarily reflect causal relationships between climate and species distributions. Thus, high predictive performance of cSDMs does not ensure that they accurately depict the role of climate in shaping species distributions. Our findings therefore call for strong caution when using cSDMs to provide predictions on future range shifts in response to climate change.

AB In 1975, Vitousek and Reiners proposed a conceptual model relating the net retention of a limiting nutrient to the net biomass accumulation in terrestrial ecosystems, whereby terrestrial systems should be highly conservative of nutrients during ecosystem succession when plants are actively accumulating biomass, but should be relatively leakier in older stands, when net plant biomass accumulation nears zero. The model was based on measurements in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. However, recent data showing that nitrate output in streams is declining across this region even as forests are aging seem to be inconsistent with this theory. Because the more recent data do not match the predictions of the Vitousek and Reiners model, either new hypotheses, or modifications of the original hypothesis, need to be considered. I suggest that the original model can be amended by accounting for increased woody debris; an accumulation of both above and belowground high C:N coarse woody debris from tree mortality in these regenerating forests can lead to high microbial immobilization of N and can explain the recent patterns of declining stream nitrate. Few studies or models have attempted to calculate the impacts of coarse woody debris (CWD) decomposition products to the retention of C and N in forested ecosystems and their receiving streams, but evidence suggests that CWD can significantly affect stream N exports and should be considered in future models of ecosystem biogeochemical cycles.

AB Understanding the drivers of animal distributions is a fundamental goal of ecology and informs habitat management. The costs and benefits of colonial aggregations in animals are well established, but the factors leading to aggregation in territorial animals remain unclear. Territorial animals might aggregate to facilitate social behavior such as (1) group defense from predators and/or parasites, (2) cooperative care of offspring, (3) extra-pair mating, and/or (4) mitigating costs of extra-pair mating through kin selection. Using experimental and observational methods, we tested predictions of all four hypotheses in a tallgrass prairie in northeast Kansas, United States. Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum) males formed clumps of territories in some parts of the site while leaving other apparently suitable areas unoccupied. Despite substantial sampling effort (653 territories and 223 nests), we found no support for any hypothesized social driver of aggregation, nor evidence that aggregation increases nest success. Our results run counter to previous evidence that conspecific interactions shape territory distributions. These results suggest one of the following alternatives: (1) the benefits of aggregation accrue to different life-history stages, or (2) the benefits of territory aggregation may be too small to detect in short-term studies and/or the consequences of aggregation are sufficiently temporally and spatially variable that they do not always appear to be locally adaptive, perhaps exacerbated by changing landscape contexts and declining population sizes.

AB North American grasslands have experienced increased relative abundance of shrubs and trees over the last 150 yr. Alterations in herbivore composition, abundance, and grazing pressure along with changes in fire frequency are drivers that can regulate the transition from grassland to shrubland or woodland (a process known as woody encroachment). Historically, North American grasslands had a suite of large herbivores that grazed and/or browsed (i.e., bison, elk, pronghorn, deer), as well as frequent and intense fires. In the tallgrass prairie, many large native ungulates were extirpated by the 1860s, corresponding with increased homesteading (which led to decreased fire frequencies and intensities). Changes in the frequency and intensity of these two drivers (browsing and fire) have coincided with woody encroachment in tallgrass prairie. Within tallgrass prairie, woody encroachment can be categorized in to two groups: non-resprouting species that can be killed with fire and resprouting species that cannot be killed with fire. Resprouting species require additional active management strategies to decrease abundance and eventually be removed from the ecosystem. In this study, we investigated plant cover, ramet density, and physiological effects of continuous simulated browsing and prescribed fire on Cornus drummondii C.A. Mey, a resprouting clonal native shrub species. Browsing reduced C. drummondii canopy cover and increased grass cover. We also observed decreased ramet density, which allowed for more infilling of grasses. Photosynthetic rates between browsed and unbrowsed control shrubs did not increase in 2015 or 2016. In 2017, photosynthetic rates for browsed shrubs were higher in the unburned site than the unbrowsed control shrubs at the end of the growing season. Additionally, after the prescribed fire, browsed shrubs had 90% decreased cover, 50% reduced ramet density, and grass cover increased by 80%. In the roots of browsed shrubs after the prescribed fire, nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) experienced a twofold reduction in glucose and a threefold reduction in both sucrose and starch. The combined effects of browsing and fire show strong potential as a successful management tool to decrease the abundance of clonal-resprouting woody plants in mesic grasslands and illustrate the potential significance of browsers as a key driver in this ecosystem.

AB Understanding age-dependent patterns of survival is fundamental to predicting population dynamics, understanding selective pressures, and estimating rates of senescence. However, quantifying age-specific survival in wild populations poses significant logistical and statistical challenges. Recent work has helped to alleviate these constraints by demonstrating that age-specific survival can be estimated using mark-recapture data even when age is unknown for all or some individuals. However, previous approaches do not incorporate auxiliary information that can improve age estimates of individuals. We introduce a survival estimator that combines a von Bertalanffy growth model, age-specific hazard functions, and a Cormack-Jolly-Seber mark-recapture model into a single hierarchical framework. This approach allows us to obtain information about age and its uncertainty based on size and growth for individuals of unknown age when estimating age-specific survival. Using both simulated and real-world data for two painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) populations, we demonstrate that this additional information substantially reduces the bias of age-specific hazard rates, which allows for the testing of hypotheses related to aging. Estimating patterns of senescence is just one practical application of jointly estimating survival and growth; other applications include obtaining better estimates of the timing of recruitment and improved understanding of life-history trade-offs between growth and survival.

AB Stochasticity is a core component of ecology, as it underlies key processes that structure and create variability in nature. Despite its fundamental importance in ecological systems, the concept is often treated as synonymous with unpredictability in community ecology, and studies tend to focus on single forms of stochasticity rather than taking a more holistic view. This has led to multiple narratives for how stochasticity mediates community dynamics. Here, we present a framework that describes how different forms of stochasticity (notably demographic and environmental stochasticity) combine to provide underlying and predictable structure in diverse communities. This framework builds on the deep ecological understanding of stochastic processes acting at individual and population levels and in modules of a few interacting species. We support our framework with a mathematical model that we use to synthesize key literature, demonstrating that stochasticity is more than simple uncertainty. Rather, stochasticity has profound and predictable effects on community dynamics that are critical for understanding how diversity is maintained. We propose next steps that ecologists might use to explore the role of stochasticity for structuring communities in theoretical and empirical systems, and thereby enhance our understanding of community dynamics.

AB Denitrification plays a critical role in regulating ecosystem nutrient availability and anthropogenic reactive nitrogen (N) production. Its importance has inspired an increasing number of studies, yet it remains the most poorly constrained term in terrestrial ecosystem N budgets. We censused the peer-reviewed soil denitrification literature (1975-2015) to identify opportunities for future studies to advance our understanding despite the inherent challenges in studying the process. We found that only one-third of studies reported estimates of both nitrous oxide (N2O) and dinitrogen (N-2) production fluxes, often the dominant end products of denitrification, while the majority of studies reported only net N2O fluxes or denitrification potential. Of the 236 studies that measured complete denitrification to N-2, 49% used the acetylene inhibition method, 84% were conducted in the laboratory, 81% were performed on surface soils (0-20 cm depth), 75% were located in North America and Europe, and 78% performed treatment manipulations, mostly of N, carbon, or water. To improve understanding of soil denitrification, we recommend broadening access to technologies for new methodologies to measure soil N-2 production rates, conducting more studies in the tropics and on subsoils, performing standardized experiments on unmanipulated soils, and using more precise terminology to refer to measured process rates (e.g., net N2O flux or denitrification potential). To overcome the greater challenges in studying soil denitrification, we envision coordinated research efforts based on standard reporting of metadata for all soil denitrification studies, standard protocols for studies contributing to a Global Denitrification Research Network, and a global consortium of denitrification researchers to facilitate sharing ideas, resources, and to provide mentorship for researchers new to the field.

AB Although species interactions are often assumed to be strongest at small spatial scales, they can interact with regional environmental factors to modify food web dynamics across biogeographic scales. The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is a widespread foundational species of both ecological and economic importance. The oyster and its associated assemblage of fish and macroinvertebrates is an ideal system to investigate how regional differences in environmental variables influence trophic interactions and food web structure. We quantified multiple environmental factors, oyster reef properties, associated species, and trophic guilds on intertidal oyster reefs within 10 estuaries along 900 km of the southeastern United States. Geographical gradients in fall water temperature and mean water depth likely influenced regional (i.e., the northern, central and southern sections of the SAB) variation in oyster reef food web structure. Variation in the biomass of mud crabs, an intermediate predator, was mostly (84.1%) explained by reefs within each site, and did not differ substantially among regions; however, regional variation in the biomass of top predators and of juvenile oysters also contributed to biogeographic variation in food web structure. In particular, region explained almost half (40.2%) of the variation in biomass of predators of blue crab, a top predator that was prevalent only in the central region where water depth was greater. Field experiments revealed that oyster mortality due to predation was greatest in the central region, suggesting spatial variation in the importance of trophic cascades. However, high oyster recruitment in the middle region probably compensates for this enhanced predation, potentially explaining why relatively less variation (17.9%) in oyster cluster biomass was explained by region. Region also explained over half of the variation in biomass of mud crab predators (55.2%), with the southern region containing almost an order of magnitude more biomass than the other two regions. In this region, higher water temperatures in the fall corresponded with higher biomass of fish that consume mud crabs and of fish that consume juvenile and forage fish, whereas biomas of their prey (mud crabs and juvenile and forage fish, respectively) was generally low in the southern region. Collectively, these results show how environmental gradients interact with trophic cascades to structure food webs associated with foundation species across biogeographic regions.

AB The ongoing global change and the increased interest in macroecological processes call for the analysis of spatially extensive data on species communities to understand and forecast distributional changes of biodiversity. Recently developed joint species distribution models can deal with numerous species efficiently, while explicitly accounting for spatial structure in the data. However, their applicability is generally limited to relatively small spatial data sets because of their severe computational scaling as the number of spatial locations increases. In this work, we propose a practical alleviation of this scalability constraint for joint species modeling by exploiting two spatial-statistics techniques that facilitate the analysis of large spatial data sets: Gaussian predictive process and nearest-neighbor Gaussian process. We devised an efficient Gibbs posterior sampling algorithm for Bayesian model fitting that allows us to analyze community data sets consisting of hundreds of species sampled from up to hundreds of thousands of spatial units. The performance of these methods is demonstrated using an extensive plant data set of 30,955 spatial units as a case study. We provide an implementation of the presented methods as an extension to the hierarchical modeling of species communities framework.

AB Whether ecosystems recover from disturbance depends on the presence of alternative stable states, which are theoretically possible in simple models of many systems. However, definitive empirical evidence for this phenomenon remains limited to demographically closed ecosystems such as lakes. In more interconnected systems such as temperate rocky reefs, the local relevance of alternative stable states might erode as immigration overwhelms local feedbacks and produces a single stable state. At larger spatial scales, dispersal might counter localized disturbance and feedbacks to synchronize states throughout a region. Here, we quantify how interconnectedness affects the relevance of alternative stable states using dynamical models of California rocky reef communities that incorporate observed environmental stochasticity and feedback loops in kelp-urchin-predator interactions. Our models demonstrate the potential for localized alternative states despite high interconnectedness likely due to feedbacks affecting dispersers as they settle into local communities. Regionally, such feedbacks affecting settlement can produce a mosaic of alternative stable states that span local (10-20 km) scales despite the synchronizing effect of long-distance dispersal. The specific spatial scale and duration of each state predominantly depend on the scales of environmental variation and on local dynamics (here, fishing). Model predictions reflect observed scales of community states in California rocky reefs and suggest how alternative states co-occur in the wide array of marine and terrestrial systems with settlement feedbacks.

AB Humid tropical forests are among the most productive ecosystems globally, yet they often occur on soils with high phosphorus (P) sorption capacity, lowering P availability to biota. Short-term anoxic events are thought to release sorbed P and enhance its acquisition by soil microbes. However, the actual effects of anoxic conditions on microbial P acquisition in humid tropical forest soils are surprisingly poorly studied. We used laboratory incubations of bulk soils, NanoSIMS analysis of single microbial cells, and landscape-scale measurements in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), Puerto Rico to test the hypothesis that anoxic conditions increase microbial P acquisition in humid tropical forests. In laboratory and field experiments, we found that microbial P uptake generally decreased under anoxic conditions, leading to high microbial carbon (C) to P ratios in anoxic soils. The decreased P acquisition under anoxic conditions was correlated with lower microbial C use efficiency (CUE), an index of microbial energy transfer in ecosystems. Phosphorus amendments to anoxic soils led to increased microbial P uptake and higher CUE suggesting that microbes were less able to access and utilize P under natural low redox conditions. Under oxic conditions, microbial C:P ratios and CUE did not respond to changes in substrate stoichiometry. These results challenge the existing paradigm by showing that anoxic conditions can decrease microbial P uptake and ultimately constrain microbial CUE. Our findings indicate that soil redox conditions tightly couple soil P and C cycles and advance our understanding of controls on P cycling in humid tropical forest ecosystems.

AB Patterns of seed dispersal and seed mortality influence the spatial structure of plant communities and the local coexistence of competing species. Most seeds are dispersed in proximity to the parent tree, where mortality is also expected to be the highest, because of competition with siblings or the attraction of natural enemies. Whereas distance-dependent mortality in the seed-to-seedling transition was often observed in tropical forests, few studies have attempted to estimate the shape of the survival-distance curves, which determines whether the peak of seedling establishment occurs away from the parent tree (Janzen-Connell pattern) or if the peak attenuates but remains at the parent location (Hubbell pattern). In this study, we inferred the probability density of seed dispersal and two stages of seedling establishment (new recruits, and seedlings 20 cm or taller) with distance for 24 tree species present in the 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot of Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Using data from seed traps, seedling survey quadrats, and tree-census records spanning the 1988-2014 period, we fit hierarchical Bayesian models including parameters for tree fecundity, the shape of the dispersal kernel, and overdispersion of seed or seedling counts. We combined predictions from multiple dispersal kernels to obtain more robust inferences. We find that Hubbell patterns are the most common and Janzen-Connell patterns are very rare among those species; that distance-dependent mortality may be stronger in the seed stage, in the early recruit stage, or comparable in both; and that species with larger seeds experience less overall mortality and less distance-dependent mortality. Finally, we describe how this modeling approach could be extended at a community scale to include less abundant species.

AB Climate change and bioinvasions are two facets of global change that can act in tandem to impact native species and ecosystems. However, their combined effects on key species have rarely been studied. The Mediterranean Sea is a hot spot of both ocean warming and bioinvasions, where their impact can be tested together. In recent years, the population of a key herbivore, the European purple sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus), has virtually collapsed along the Israeli Mediterranean coast (southeastern Levant). Here, we used field and lab experiments to test two complementary hypotheses that may explain the urchin population collapse: (1) resource competition that may lead to competitive exclusion by invasive grazers (two Red Sea rabbitfishes) and (2) reduced performance due to ocean warming. An inclusion-exclusion in situ caging experiment revealed a strong negative impact of fish grazing on algal cover and on the urchin's gut content and gonado-somatic index (GSI). Laboratory experiments revealed a considerable negative impact of both elevated temperature and food deficiency on sea urchin respiration and GSI, and consequently on its energy budget and reproductive potential and, potentially, fitness. Such reduced reproductive capacity must have greatly lowered the sea urchin's population viability, contributing (and possibly even leading) to its collapse in the southeastern Levant in the past two decades. Urchin population declines are expected to spread to the west and north of the Mediterranean Sea following further warming and rabbitfish expansion. This study is the first to demonstrate the potential additive effects of ocean warming and implied competitive exclusion by an invader on a native species at its warm biogeographic distribution edge.

DT Article; Data Paper
DE Africa; birding; ecology; feeding; long-term survey; occurrences;

AB The Serengeti ecosystem contains one of the most diverse bird assemblages in Africa. We present here a data set consisting of abundances of bird species in different habitats of the Serengeti ecosystem over a 87-yr time frame. This data set comprises 66,643 georeferenced occurrences for 568 species from 1929 to 2017. Most records contain feeding location, food source, distribution status, and observation locality. The records originate from three different but complementary methodologies: points, sites, and transects. The point method (bird species records 1929-2017) is based on ad hoc observations and includes rare species or those in special habitats. These points came from published records as well from the research program of A. R. E. Sinclair and colleagues. The site method (1966-2017) is based on structured observations at sites selected to represent specific habitats, and replicated within habitats and over time. At each site, birds were recorded by sight and sound over a radius of 50 m for 10 min. The transect method (1997-2011) is based on road transects covering different areas of the ecosystem. Road transects were traversed using a vehicle with observers travelling at 30 km/h. Bird species were those easily seen from a vehicle out to 50 m either side. As most transects were traversed multiple times, this method provides information on temporal change in abundance for a select set of species. No copyright restrictions apply to the use of this data set other than citing this publication.

AB Inducible defense is a common form of phenotypic plasticity, and inducibility (change in defense after herbivore attack) has long been predicted to trade off with constitutive (or baseline) defense to manage resource allocation. Although such trade-offs likely constrain evolution within species, the extent to which they influence divergence among species is unresolved. We studied cardenolide toxins among genetic families in eight North American Asclepias species, spanning the full range of defense in the genus. Using common environment experiments and chemical assays, we report a consistent trade-off (negative genetic correlation) between concentrations of constitutive cardenolides and their inducibility within each species. However, no trade-off was found in a phylogenetic analysis across species. To investigate factors driving differences in defense allocation among species we used latitude as a proxy for growing season and herbivore pressure and found that divergence into lower latitudes resulted in evolution of higher cardenolides overall. Next we used an enzymatic assay of the cellular target of cardenolides (sodium-potassium ATPase) and confirm that higher cardenolides resulted in stronger toxicity to a sensitive species, but not to specialized monarch butterflies. Thus, plant speciation into biogeographic regions with alternative resources or pest pressure resulted in the macroevolution of cardenolide defense, especially against unspecialized herbivores. Nonetheless, trade-offs persist in the extent to which this defense is allocated constitutively or is inducible among genotypes within each species.

AB The study of community succession is one of the oldest pursuits in ecology. Challenges remain in terms of evaluating the predictability of succession and the reliability of the chronosequence methods typically used to study community development. The research of William S. Cooper in Glacier Bay National Park is an early and well-known example of successional ecology that provides a long-term observational data set to test hypotheses derived from space-for-time substitutions. It also provides a unique opportunity to explore the importance of historical contingencies and as an example of a revitalized historical study system. We test the textbook successional trajectory in Glacier Bay and evaluate long-term plant community development via primary succession through extensive fieldwork, remote sensing, dendrochronological methods, and newly discovered data that fills in data gaps (1940s to late 1980s) in continuous measurement over 100+ years. To date, Cooper's quadrats do not support the classic facilitation model of succession in which a sequence of species interacts to form predictable successional trajectories. Rather, stochastic early community assembly and subsequent inhibition have dominated; most species arrived shortly after deglaciation and have remained stable for 50+ years. Chronosequence studies assuming prior composition are thus questionable, as no predictable species sequence or timeline was observed. This underscores the significance of assumptions about early conditions in chronosequences and the need to defend such assumptions. Furthermore, this work brings a classic study system in ecology up to date via a plot size expansion, new baseline biogeochemical data, and spatial mapping for future researchers for its second century of observation.

AB Functional diversity (FD) has the potential to address many ecological questions, from impacts of global change on biodiversity to ecological restoration. There are several methods estimating the different components of FD. However, most of these methods can only be computed at limited spatial scales and cannot account for intraspecific trait variability (ITV), despite its significant contribution to FD. Trait probability density (TPD) functions (which explicitly account for ITV) reflect the probabilistic nature of niches. By doing so, the TPD approach reconciles existing methods for estimating FD within a unifying framework, allowing FD to be partitioned seamlessly across multiple scales (from individuals to species, and from local to global scales), and accounting for ITV. We present methods to estimate TPD functions at different spatial scales and probabilistic implementations of several FD concepts, including the primary components of FD (functional richness, evenness, and divergence), functional redundancy, functional rarity, and solutions to decompose beta FD into nested and unique components. The TPD framework has the potential to unify and expand analyses of functional ecology across scales, capturing the probabilistic and multidimensional nature of FD. The R package TPD () will allow users to achieve more comparative results across regions and case studies.

AB As wildlife populations continue to decline worldwide, human-caused mortality of terrestrial vertebrates is of increasing importance. However, there is a limited understanding of how direct anthropogenic mortality compares in magnitude to natural mortality. Here, we present CauseSpec, a database of global terrestrial vertebrate cause-specific mortality. We compiled studies that used telemetry to monitor terrestrial vertebrates and determine cause of death. We distinguished between anthropogenic and natural mortality and also documented the specific mortality source where possible (e.g., harvest, vehicle collision, predation, and starvation). This database consists of 1,134 studies that collectively monitored the fates of 123,747 individual animals. From this, there are 43,998 deaths of known cause among 307 species. It is an updated version of the data set used in Hill et al. (2019) and will continue to be updated in the future. These data can be combined with data on species morphology and behavior to examine how species attributes influence susceptibility to various mortality sources. Our database also includes the geographic coordinates of the study site so that site attributes can be included in analyses. We also distinguish between adults and juveniles where possible, allowing for age-specific mortality analyses. Study start and end dates are available as well so that analyses of temporal changes in mortality are possible. Last, users can select all cause-specific mortality studies from a single species to perform a species-level analysis. The data set will allow users to circumvent a literature search, facilitating more rapid publication of large-scale vertebrate mortality studies and elucidating mortality patterns of terrestrial vertebrates around the world. There are no copyright or proprietary restrictions. We would like researchers to cite this paper if the associated database is used to find studies of interest for analysis.

AB Biodiversity loss is occurring globally at unprecedented rates, altering the functioning of the Earth's ecosystems. Multiple processes are often key components of ecosystem functioning, but it is unclear how biodiversity loss affects ecosystem multifunctionality (i.e., the ability of ecosystems to maintain multiple processes simultaneously). This is particularly true for some ecosystem types such as streams, which have been understudied, despite their key role in global biogeochemical cycles and their serious impairment by the widespread loss of riparian vegetation as a result of global change. Using a microcosm experiment, we tested whether losing riparian plant diversity affected stream multifunctionality, taking into account nine key processes related to litter decomposition, animal biomass production, and nutrient cycling, and simulating plant species loss from four to one in the presence or absence of litter-feeding detritivores. Multifunctionality increased with plant diversity in the presence of detritivores and decreased in their absence, evidencing a key role of detritivores in biodiversity-ecosystem-functioning (BEF) relationships. Moreover, by exploring effects of plant diversity on each process individually we were able to reveal potential mechanisms underlying BEF relationships; for example, effects of plant diversity on nutrient cycling occurred at least partly via indirect nutrient transfer, and were possibly accompanied by changes in microbial stoichiometry. Such mechanisms were unnoticeable when examining multifunctionality metrics, suggesting that individual processes provide crucial information to understand how stream ecosystem functioning is impaired by biodiversity loss.

AB Climate change has caused widespread shifts in species' phenology, but the consequences for population and community dynamics remain unclear because of uncertainty regarding the species-specific drivers of phenology and abundance, and the implications for synchrony among interacting species. Here, we develop a statistical model to quantify inter-annual variation in phenology and abundance over an environmental gradient, and use it to identify potential drivers of phenology and abundance in co-occurring species. We fit the model to counts of 10 butterfly species with single annual generations over a mountain elevation gradient, as an exemplar system in which temporally limited availability of biotic resources and favorable abiotic conditions impose narrow windows of seasonal activity. We estimate parameters describing changes in abundance, and the peak time and duration of the flight period, over ten years (2004-2013) and across twenty sample locations (930-2,050 m) in central Spain. We also use the model outputs to investigate relationships of phenology and abundance with temperature and rainfall. Annual shifts in phenology were remarkably consistent among species, typically showing earlier flight periods during years with warm conditions in March or May-June. In contrast, inter-annual variation in relative abundance was more variable among species, and generally less well associated with climatic conditions. Nevertheless, warmer temperatures in June were associated with increased relative population growth in three species, and five species had increased relative population growth in years with earlier flight periods. These results suggest that broadly coherent interspecific changes to phenology could help to maintain temporal synchrony in community dynamics under climate change, but that the relative composition of communities may vary due to interspecific inconsistency in population dynamic responses to climate change. However, it may still be possible to predict abundance change for species based on a robust understanding of relationships between their population dynamics and phenology, and the environmental drivers of both.

AB Growth of soil microorganisms is often described as carbon limited, and adding labile carbon to soil often results in a transient and large increase in respiration. In contrast, soil microbial biomass changes little, suggesting that growth and respiration are decoupled in response to a carbon pulse. Alternatively, measuring bulk responses of the entire community (total respiration and biomass) could mask ecologically important variation among taxa in response to the added carbon. Here, we assessed taxon-specific variation in cellular growth (measured as DNA synthesis) and metabolic activity (measured as rRNA synthesis) following glucose addition to soil using quantitative stable isotope probing with (H2O)-O-18. We found that glucose addition altered rates of DNA and rRNA synthesis, but the effects were strongly taxon specific: glucose stimulated growth and rRNA transcription for some taxa, and suppressed these for others. These contrasting taxon-specific responses could explain the small and transient changes in total soil microbial biomass. Responses to glucose were not well predicted by a priori assignments of taxa into copiotrophic or oligotrophic categories. Across all taxa, rates of DNA and rRNA synthesis changed in parallel, indicating that growth and activity were coupled, and the degree of coupling was unaffected by glucose addition. This pattern argues against the idea that labile carbon addition causes a large reduction in metabolic growth efficiency; rather, the large pulse of respiration observed with labile substrate addition is more likely to be the result of rapid turnover of microbial biomass, possibly due to trophic interactions. Our results support a strong connection between rRNA synthesis and bacterial growth, and indicate that taxon-specific responses among soil bacteria can buffer responses at the scale of the whole community.

AB Many organisms experience seasonal windows of opportunity for growth and reproduction. These windows represent intervals in time when organisms experience improved prospects for advancing their life history objectives, constrained by the combined effects of seasonally variable biotic and abiotic conditions acting independently or in combination. Although seasonal windows of opportunity are likely to be widespread in nature, relatively few studies have conducted the repeated observations necessary to identify them or suggest the factors that structure them in time. Here, we present the results of three experimental studies conducted at different field sites in three different years in which we manipulated the phenology of monarch caterpillars (Danaus plexippus) throughout the growing season. The primary aims of these experiments were (1) to identify seasonal windows of opportunity for successful larval development on milkweed (Asclepias spp.), and (2) to suggest which factors are most likely to constrain these windows of opportunity in time. We found strong seasonal windows of opportunity in the developmental success of monarchs, with distinct periods of higher developmental prospects during each study year. We evaluated the role of seasonal variation in abiotic thermal stress, host plant density, host plant defensive traits, and natural enemy risk as potential factors that may limit seasonal windows of opportunity. By comparing the seasonal patterns of larval success and potential explanatory factors across all 3 yr, we find patterns that are consistent with seasonally variable abiotic conditions, host plant availability, host plant traits, and natural enemy risk factors. These results suggest the potential for seasonal variation in the factors that limit monarch larval development and population growth. More generally, this study also highlights the value of temporally explicit experimental studies that can identify and examine seasonal patterns in species interactions.

AB The extent to which populations in nature are regulated by density-dependent processes is unresolved. While experiments increasingly find evidence of strong density dependence, unmanipulated population time series yield much more ambiguous evidence of regulation, especially when accounting for effects of observation error. Here, we reexamine the evidence for density dependence in time series of population sizes in nature, by conducting an aggregate analysis of the populations in the Global Population Dynamics Database (GPDD). First, following the conventional approach, we fit a density-dependent and a density-independent variant of the Gompertz state-space model to each time series. Then, we conduct an aggregate analysis of the entire database by considering two random-effects density-dependent models that leverage information across data sets. When individual time series are tested independently, we find very little evidence for density dependence. However, in the aggregate, we find very strong evidence for density dependence, even though, paradoxically, estimated strengths of density dependence for individual time series tend to be weaker than when each individual time series is analyzed independently. Furthermore, a hierarchical model that accounts for taxonomic variation in the strength of density dependence reveals that density dependence is consistently stronger in insects and fish than in birds and mammals. Our findings resolve apparent inconsistencies between observational and experimental studies of density dependence by revealing that the observational record does indeed contain strong support for the hypothesis that density dependence is widespread in nature.

AB Food availability early in life can play a vital role in an individual's development and success, but experimental evidence for the direct effects of food on body condition, physiology, and survival of young animals in the wild is still relatively scarce. Food-caching Canada Jays (Perisoreus canadensis) begin breeding in the late winter and, therefore, rely on either cached food or seemingly limited quantities of fresh food to feed nestlings in the early spring. Using a 2-yr food supplementation experiment conducted during the nestling period and 40 yr of observational data on food supplemented by the public, we examined whether food quantity during early life influenced the physiology, body condition, timing of fledging, and survival of young Canada Jays in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada. Experimental food supplementation of breeding pairs advanced the fledging date of young by 24% (5.5 d) compared to controls. In 1 yr of the experiment, nestlings raised on experimentally supplemented territories had lower feather corticosterone concentrations and were in higher body condition than controls. Across treatment and control nests, young that successfully fledged had lower concentrations of feather corticosterone and were in higher body condition than those that did not fledge. Based on 40 yr of observational data, nestling body condition was positively related to the degree of food supplementation by park visitors and nestlings in higher body condition were more likely to be observed in the population in the following fall. Our results demonstrate how food availability early in life can have important downstream consequences on metrics related to individual fitness, including first year survival.

AB Global change drivers can interact in synergistic ways, yet the interactive effect of global change drivers, such as climatic warming and species invasions, on plant pollination are poorly represented in experimental studies. We paired manipulative experiments to probe two mechanistic pathways through which plant invasion and warming may alter phenology and reproduction of native plant species. In the first, we tested how experimental warming (+1.7 degrees C) modulated flowering phenology and how this affected flowering overlap between a native plant (Dracophyllum subulatum) and an invasive plant (Calluna vulgaris L.). In the second experiment, we explored how variation in the ratio of native to invasive flowers, and the overall quantity of resources in a floral patch, affected the reproduction of the native species. We hypothesized that the flowering overlap of native and invasive plants would be altered by warming, given that invading plants typically exhibit greater phenological plasticity than native plants. Further, we hypothesized that pollination of native plant flowers would decrease in floral patches dominated by invasive plant flowers, but that this effect would depend on total floral density in the patch. As predicted, the invasive plant had a stronger phenological response to experimental warming than the native plant, resulting in increased flowering overlap between the native the invasive plants. There was a four-fold increase in the number of native flowers co-flowering with high densities of invasive flowers suggesting native plant competition for pollinators with invasive plants under a warmed climate. In the second experiment, we found depressed seed masses of the native species in high density floral patches that were dominated by invasive flowers relative to high density floral patches dominated by native flowers. At low floral densities, seed mass of native plants was unaffected by invasion. Together, these results demonstrate that by increasing their phenological overlap, warming may enhance the magnitude of existing competition for pollination exerted by an invasive plant on a native plant, particularly in plant patches with high floral density. Our results illustrate a novel pathway through which global change drivers can operate synergistically to alter an important ecosystem service: pollination.

AB Environmental stress impedes predation and herbivory by limiting the ability of animals to search for and consume prey. We tested the contingency of this relationship on consumer traits and specifically hypothesized that herbivore mobility relative to the return time of limiting environmental stress would predict consumer effects. We examined how wave-induced water motion affects marine communities via herbivory by highly mobile (fish) vs. slow-moving (pencil urchin) consumers at two wave-sheltered and two wave-exposed rocky subtidal locations in the Galapagos Islands. The exposed locations experienced 99th percentile flow speeds that were 2-5 times greater than sheltered locations, with mean flow speeds >33 cm/s vs. <16 cm/s, 2-7 times higher standing macroalgal cover and 2-3 times lower cover of crustose coralline algae than the sheltered locations. As predicted by the environmental stress hypothesis (ESH), there was a negative relationship between mean flow speed and urchin abundance and herbivory rates on Ulva spp. algal feeding assays. In contrast, the biomass of surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae) and parrotfishes (Labridae: Scarinae) was positively correlated with mean flow speed. Ulva assays were consumed at equal rates by fish at exposed and sheltered locations, indicating continued herbivory even when flow speeds surpassed maximum reported swimming speeds at a rate of 1-2 times per minute. Modeled variation in fish species richness revealed minimal effects of diversity on herbivory rates at flow speeds <40 cm/s, when all species were capable of foraging, and above 120 cm/s, when no species could forage, while increasing diversity maximized herbivory rates at flow speeds of 40-120 cm/s. Two-month herbivore exclusion experiments during warm and cool seasons revealed that macroalgal biomass was positively correlated with flow speed. Fish limited macroalgal development by 65-91% at one exposed location but not the second and by 70% at the two sheltered locations. In contrast, pencil urchins did not affect algal communities at either exposed location, but reduced macroalgae by 87% relative to controls at both sheltered locations. We propose an extension of the ESH that is contingent upon mobility to explain species-specific changes in feeding rates and consumer effects on benthic communities across environmental gradients.

AB Understanding how stochastic fluctuations in the environment influence population dynamics is crucial for sustainable management of biological diversity. However, because species do not live in isolation, this requires knowledge of how species interactions influence population dynamics. In addition, spatial processes play an important role in shaping population dynamics. It is therefore important to improve our understanding of how these different factors act together to shape patterns of abundance across space within and among species. Here, we present a new analytical model for understanding patterns of covariation in space between interacting species in a stochastic environment. We show that the correlation between two species in how they experience the same environmental conditions determines how correlated fluctuations in their densities would be in the absence of competition. In other words, without competition, synchrony between the species is driven by the environment, similar to the Moran effect within a species. Competition between the two species causes their abundances to become less positively or more negatively correlated. The same strength of competition has a greater negative effect on the correlation between species when one of them has a more variable growth rate than the other. In addition, dispersal or other movement weakens the effect of competition on the interspecific correlation. Finally, we show that movement increases the distance over which the species are (positively or negatively) correlated, an effect that is stronger when the species are competitors, and that there is a close connection between the spatial scaling of population synchrony within a species and between species. Our results show that the relationships between the different factors influencing interspecific correlations in abundance are not simple linear ones, but this model allows us to disentangle them and predict how they will affect population fluctuations in different situations.

AB Accurate estimates of seasonal infection risk can be used by animal health officials to predict future disease risk and improve understanding of the mechanisms driving disease dynamics. It can be difficult to estimate seasonal infection risk in wildlife disease systems because surveillance assays typically target antibodies (serosurveillance), which are not necessarily indicative of current infection, and serosurveillance sampling is often opportunistic. Recently developed methods estimate past time of infection from serosurveillance data using quantitative serological assays that indicate the amount of antibodies in a serology sample. However, current methods do not account for common opportunistic and uneven sampling associated with serosurveillance data. We extended the framework of survival analysis to improve estimates of seasonal infection risk from serosurveillance data across population and regional scales. We found that accounting for the right-censored nature of quantitative serology samples greatly improved estimates of seasonal infection risk, even when sampling was uneven in time. Survival analysis can also be used to account for common challenges when estimating infection risk from serology data, such as biases induced by host demography and continually elevated antibodies following infection. The framework developed herein is widely applicable for estimating seasonal infection risk from serosurveillance data in humans, wildlife, and livestock.

AB Individual diet specialization appears widespread and has several ecological ramifications. Hypotheses on the causes of diet specialization generally assume prey preferences differ among predator individuals. They then predict how the magnitude of diet variation should change when ecological factors (e.g., intraspecific competition) alter prey abundances. However, the magnitude of diet variation is expected to change with prey abundances due to stochasticity in the foraging process even if all predators share the same prey preferences. Here I show that the relative prey abundance where diet variation is maximized and the magnitudes of diet variation in prey switching experiments are predicted well by a simple stochastic foraging model based only on relative prey abundances and a shared relative prey preference among predators. These results suggest that the effects of stochasticity during foraging may confound studies of individual diet specialization if these effects are not accounted for in experimental design or interpretation. Furthermore, the stochastic foraging model provides simple baseline expectations for theoretical studies on the ecological consequences of diet variation and offers a way forward on quantitative predictions of how ecological factors influence the magnitude of diet variation when stochasticity during foraging and diet specialization occur simultaneously. Last, this study highlights the continued importance of integrating stochasticity into mechanistic ecological hypotheses.

AB Locally, plant species richness supports many ecosystem functions. Yet, the mechanisms driving these often-positive biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships are not well understood. Spatial resource partitioning across vertical resource gradients is one of the main hypothesized causes for enhanced ecosystem functioning in more biodiverse grasslands. Spatial resource partitioning occurs if species differ in where they acquire resources and can happen both above- and belowground. However, studies investigating spatial resource partitioning in grasslands provide inconsistent evidence. We present the results of a meta-analysis of 21 data sets from experimental species-richness gradients in grasslands. We test the hypothesis that increasing spatial resource partitioning along vertical resource gradients enhances ecosystem functioning in diverse grassland plant communities above- and belowground. To test this hypothesis, we asked three questions. (1) Does species richness enhance biomass production or community resource uptake across sites? (2) Is there evidence of spatial resource partitioning as indicated by resource tracer uptake and biomass allocation above- and belowground? (3) Is evidence of spatial resource partitioning correlated with increased biomass production or community resource uptake? Although plant species richness enhanced community nitrogen and potassium uptake and biomass production above- and belowground, we found that plant communities did not meet our criteria for spatial resource partitioning, though they did invest in significantly more aboveground biomass in higher canopy layers in mixture relative to monoculture. Furthermore, the extent of spatial resource partitioning across studies was not positively correlated with either biomass production or community resource uptake. Our results suggest that spatial resource partitioning across vertical resource gradients alone does not offer a general explanation for enhanced ecosystem functioning in more diverse temperate grasslands.

AB Disturbance plays a key role in structuring community dynamics and is central to conservation and natural resource management. However, ecologists continue to debate the importance of disturbance for species coexistence and biodiversity. Such disagreements may arise in part because few studies have examined variation across multiple dimensions of disturbance (e.g., size, frequency) and how the effects of disturbance may depend on species attributes (e.g., competitiveness, dispersal ability). In light of this gap in understanding and accelerating changes to disturbance regimes worldwide, we used spatial population models to explore how disturbance size and frequency interact with species attributes to affect coexistence between seagrass (Zostera marina) and colonial burrowing shrimp (Neotrypaea californiensis) that compete for benthic space in estuaries throughout the west coast of North America. By simulating population dynamics under a range of ecologically relevant disturbance regimes, we discovered that intermediate disturbance (approximately 9-23% of landscape area per year) to short-dispersing, competitively dominant seagrass can foster long-term stable coexistence with broad-dispersing, competitively inferior burrowing shrimp via the spatial storage effect. When holding the total extent of disturbance constant, the individual size and annual frequency of disturbance altered landscape spatial patterns and mediated the dominance and evenness of competitors. Many small disturbances favored short-dispersing seagrass by hastening recolonization, whereas fewer large disturbances benefited rapidly colonizing burrowing shrimp by creating temporary refugia from competition. As a result, large, infrequent disturbances generally improved the strength and stability of coexistence relative to small, frequent disturbances. Regardless of disturbance size or frequency, the dispersal ability of the superior competitor (seagrass), the competitive ability of the inferior competitor (burrowing shrimp), and the reproduction and survival of both species strongly influenced population abundances and coexistence. Our results show that disturbance size and frequency can promote or constrain coexistence by altering the duration of time over which inferior competitors can escape competitive exclusion, particularly when colonization depends on the spatial pattern of disturbance due to dispersal traits. For coastal managers and conservation practitioners, our findings indicate that reducing particularly large disturbances may help conserve globally imperiled seagrass meadows and control burrowing shrimp colonies that can threaten the viability of oyster aquaculture.

AB Changes in understory plant composition and biodiversity declines in northeastern North American forests are widespread. Preserving species and ecosystem function requires appropriate identification and management of important stressors. Coexistence of stressors, among them earthworm invasions and white-tailed deer, makes correct identification of mechanisms that cause diversity declines challenging. We used an established factorial experiment to assess survival and growth of native seedlings (Actaea pachypoda, Aquilegia canadensis, Cornus racemosa, Quercus rubra, and Prenanthes alba) in response to presence/absence of deer and earthworms. We expected deer and earthworms to reduce seedling survival and biomass, and we evaluated potential pathways to explain this impact (soil N and P concentrations and pools, root architecture, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [AMF] colonization). We developed structural equation models (SEM) to identify specific pathways through which earthworms and deer were impacting plant species with different life histories. Seedling survival was not affected by our treatments nor the plant and soil variables we tested. Actaea biomass was smaller in earthworm-invaded plots, and with larger total N pools. In contrast, both deer and earthworm treatments were associated with lower soil nutrient concentrations, and earthworm-invaded plots had smaller N and extractable P pools. Actaea, Cornus, Prenanthes, and Quercus seedlings had a lower proportion of fine roots in earthworm-invaded plots, while fine roots in Aquilegia made up a higher proportion of the root system. AMF colonization in Quercus was reduced in sites colonized by earthworms, but AMF in other species were unaffected. Our SEMs showed high correlation among soil variables, but because we do not know which variables are drivers of this change and which are passengers, we can only conclude that they are changing together as deer and earthworms exert their respective influence. Different plant species responded in idiosyncratic ways to earthworm and deer effects on soil fertility, root architecture and limited effects on AMF colonization. While earthworm and deer-mediated changes to fine roots, soil nutrients, and AMF may lead to changes in plant performance over time, these changes rarely translated to lower plant performance in our seedlings.

AB Fire controls tree cover in many savannas by suppressing saplings through repeated topkill and resprouting, causing a demographic bottleneck. Tree cover can increase dramatically if even a small fraction of saplings escape this fire trap, so modeling and management of savanna vegetation should account for occasional individuals that escape the fire trap because they are "better" (i.e., they grow faster than average) or because they are "lucky" (they experience an occasional longer-than-average interval without fire or a below-average fire severity). We quantified variation in growth rates and topkill probability in Quercus laevis (turkey oak) in longleaf pine savanna to estimate the percentage of stems expected to escape the fire trap due to variability in (1) growth rate, (2) fire severity, and (3) fire interval. For trees growing at the mean rate and exposed to the mean fire severity and the mean fire interval, no saplings are expected to become adults under typical fire frequencies. Introducing variability in any of these factors, however, allows some individuals to escape the fire trap. A variable fire interval had the greatest influence, allowing 8% of stems to become adults within a century. In contrast, introducing variation in fire severity and growth rate should allow 2.8% and 0.3% of stems to become adults, respectively. Thus, most trees that escape the fire trap do so because of luck. By chance, they experience long fire-free intervals and/or a low-severity fire when they are not yet large enough to resist an average fire. Fewer stems escape the fire trap by being unusually fast-growing individuals. It is important to quantify these sources of variation and their consequences to improve understanding, prediction, and management of vegetation dynamics of fire-maintained savannas. Here we also present a new approach to quantifying variation in fire severity utilizing a latent-variable model of logistic regression.

AB Distance-based ordinations have played a critical role in community ecology for more than half a century, but are still under active development. These methods employ a matrix of pairwise distances or dissimilarities between sample units, and map sample units from the high-dimensional distance or dissimilarity space to a low-dimensional representation for analysis. Distance- or dissimilarity-based methods employ continuum or gradient ecological theory and a variety of statistical models to achieve the mapping. Recently, ecologists have developed model-based ordinations based on latent vectors and individual species response models. These methods employ the individualistic perspective of Gleason as the ecological model, and Bayesian or maximum-likelihood methods to estimate the parameters for the low dimensional space represented by the latent vectors. In this research I compared two distance-based methods (NMDS and t-SNE) with two model-based methods (BORAL and REO) on five data sets to determine which methods are superior for (1) extracting meaningful ecological drivers of variability in community composition, and (2) estimating sample unit locations in ordination space that maximize the goodness-of-fit of individual species response models to the estimated sample unit locations. Environmental variables and species were fitted to the ordinations by generalized additive models (GAMs) with Gaussian, negative binomial, or Poisson distribution models as appropriate. Across the five data sets, 22 models of environmental variability and 449 models of species distributions were calculated for each of the ordination methods. To minimize the effects of stochasticity the entire analysis was replicated three times and results averaged across the replicates. Results were evaluated by deviance explained and AIC for environmental variables and species distributions, averaged by ordination method for each data set, and ranked from best to worst. For the four assessments distance-based methods ranked 1 and 2 in three cases, and 1 and 3 in one case, significantly out performing the model-based methods. t-SNE was the top-performing method, out performing NMDS especially on the more complex data sets. In general the gradient-based theoretical basis and data sufficiency of distance-based methods allowed distance-based methods to outperform model-based methods in every assessment.

AB We compiled a data set for all tree species collected to date in lowland Amazonian Ecuador in order to determine the number of tree species in the region. This data set has been extensively verified by taxonomists and is the most comprehensive attempt to evaluate the tree diversity in one of the richest species regions of the Amazon. We used four main sources of data: mounted specimens deposited in Ecuadorian herbaria only, specimen records of a large-scale 1-hectare-plot network (60 plots in total), data from the Missouri Botanical Garden Tropicos (R) database (MO), and literature sources. The list of 2,296 tree species names we provide in this data set is based on 47,486 herbarium records deposited in the following herbaria: Alfredo Paredes Herbarium (QAP), Catholic University Herbarium (QCA), Herbario Nacional del Ecuador (QCNE), Missouri Botanical Garden (MO), and records from an extensive sampling of 29,768 individuals with diameter at breast height (dbh) >= 10 cm recorded in our plot network. We also provide data for the relative abundance of species, geographic coordinates of specimens deposited in major herbaria around the world, whether the species is native or endemic, current hypothesis of geographic distribution, representative collections, and IUCN threat category for every species recorded to date in Amazonian Ecuador. These data are described in Metadata S1 and can be used for macroecological, evolutionary, or taxonomic studies.

AB Across landscapes, shifts in species composition often co-occur with shifts in structural or abiotic habitat features, making it difficult to disentangle the role of competitors and environment on assessments of patch quality. Using over two decades of rodent community data from a long-term experiment, we show that a small, ubiquitous granivore (Chaetodipus penicillatus) shifted its use of different experimental treatments with the establishment of a novel competitor, C. baileyi. Shifts in residency, probability of movement between patches, and the arrival of new individuals in patches altered which treatment supported the highest abundances of C. penicillatus. Our results suggest that the establishment of a new species worsened the quality of the originally preferred treatment, likely by impacting resource availability. Paradoxically, the presence of the new species also increased C. penicillatus' use of the less preferred treatment, potentially through shifts in the competitive network on those plots.

AB The development of antipredator traits is dependent on the frequency and intensity of predator exposure over evolutionary and ecological time. We hypothesized that prey species would respond with increasing accuracy when exposed to predators across generational, ontogenetic, and immediate time scales. We assessed larval Pacific chorus frog (PSRE; Pseudacris regilla) individuals that varied in population sympatry, embryonic conditioning, and immediate exposure to stocked populations of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Using PSRE populations from sites with and without resident rainbow trout, we conditioned embryos to trout odor, PSRE alarm cues, trout odor in combination with alarm cues, or control water. After being hatched and reared in control water, individuals were exposed to the four predator cue treatments using a fully factorial design. Tadpoles from populations with resident rainbow trout did not behave or develop differently than tadpoles originating from fishless sites. However, we found evidence that PSRE reduced predation risk with a combination of carry-over effect (i.e., transfer of information across life history stages) and within-life stage phenotypically plastic mechanisms. We found both developmental and behavioral carry-over effects: tadpoles conditioned with trout odor as embryos grew more slowly and took refuge more often than control animals. Within-life-stage behavioral plasticity was observed in tadpoles from all treatment groups, responding to predator cues with increased refuge use. Potentially additive effects of predator exposure on prey response should be considered when predicting the ability of prey to recognize novel threats.

AB We developed a framework for the hierarchical pathways of bottom-up (niche dimensionality) and top-down control (herbivory) on biomass of stream algae via changes in guild composition (relative abundance of low profile, high profile, and motile guilds), species richness, and evenness. We further tested (1) the contrasting predictions of resource competition theory vs. the benthic model of coexistence on how the number of added nutrients constrains species richness, (2) the relationship between species richness and evenness, and (3) the biodiversity-ecosystem-function paradigm. Implementing a combination of field and lab experiments that manipulated for the first time in benthic algae herbivory and/or niche dimensionality, i.e., the number of added nutrients (NAN), including nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and manganese, we made the following discoveries. First, important predictors of guild composition were herbivory (field) and NAN (lab); of richness, NAN (field) and NAN and guild composition (lab); of evenness, guild composition (field and lab) and herbivory (field); and of biomass, guild composition, NAN, and richness + evenness (field and lab). Herbivory increased the proportions of the low profile and motile guilds but decreased the proportion of the high profile guild. In the absence of grazing, greater proportions of the high profile guild resulted in elevated richness and biomass but diminished evenness, whereas in the presence of grazing, these relationships generally disappeared. Second, both experiments confirmed the prediction of the benthic model that species richness increases with NAN, a pattern inconsistent with resource competition theory. Third, supplementation with manganese and/or iron increased algal richness, indicating that micronutrients, which have generally been overlooked in stream ecology, added dimensions to the algal niche. Fourth, the richness-evenness relationship, observed only in the absence of herbivory, depended on the size of the species pool. It was positive at richness lower than 49 species (lab), implying complementarity and facilitation, while at higher richness (field and lab), this relationship was negative, consistent with negative interspecific interactions. Finally, the greater dependence of biomass production on guild composition and NAN than on richness and evenness suggests that more comprehensive, environmentally explicit, and trait-based approaches are necessary for the study of the biodiversity-ecosystem-function paradigm.

AB Plants commonly employ indirect resistance to reduce herbivory by provisioning predatory arthropod populations with additional resources. Numerous predatory arthropods consume pollen that is entrapped on dense, wooly trichomes of plants. Over two seasons, we supplemented pollen on the wooly leaves of turkey mullein, Croton setiger, in natural populations to determine if pollen entrapped on leaves supplements predatory arthropods and reduces herbivore populations and damage to the plant. Pollen supplementation increased the abundance of predatory spiders in both years and omnivorous Orius bugs in 1 yr but had no effect on predatory hemipterans. Pollen supplementation reduced the abundance of herbivorous fleahoppers. Pollen supplementation decreased the amount of leaf damage experienced by plants over the season, suggesting that pollen entrapment may act as an indirect resistance. While C. setiger plants have little control over the amount of pollen on their surfaces, pollen adds to the diet of predatory arthropods that reduce herbivory, thus attraction of predators may be an adaptive benefit of leaf structures such as wooly trichomes that entrap pollen.

AB The protection of agricultural soil quality is critical to environmental sustainability and requires relevant indicators. Total soil organic carbon (SOC) is of importance for soil quality but its slow dynamic and inherent variability do not allow early detection of changes. The project CARBIOSOL provides a data set from agricultural soils in Wallonia (Southern Belgium), of total SOC, SOC fractions and biological indicators, selected for their relevance as indicators of soil quality. Two land uses (sampled in 2013), five agricultural regions (2015), seasonal variability in croplands (2016) and four management types (2017) were studied. Soil organic carbon content (total, stable fine fraction <20 mu m, labile coarse fraction >20 mu m), cold and hot water extractable carbon and nitrogen contents, total nitrogen, pH(KC)(l), pH(H)(2O), potential respiration, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, net nitrogen mineralization, metabolic potential of soil bacteria, earthworm density and biomass, and two ecophysiological quotients (metabolic and microbial quotient) were measured for a total of 415 samples. The present data set provides an important contribution for establishing a reference system of soil quality in Wallonia and eventually for large-scale studies through its integration into a global database. Moreover, the present data set could be used to support the interpretation of measurements of fractions of SOC and biological indicators by soil analyses laboratories, which will be useful for farmers and decision makers to evaluate the effect of different management practices.

AB Plant invasion can significantly alter soil nutrient cycling of ecosystems. How these changes are linked to soil enzyme activities is still unknown, however, even though these are proximate agents of organic matter decomposition and nutrient release. We performed a meta-analysis of 60 case studies examining responses of 10 unique soil enzymes to plant invasion, and tested whether invaded soils differed in their enzyme activities from uninvaded soils. We also examined whether increases in soil nutrient-releasing enzyme activity were paralleled by enhanced soil nutrient availability after plant invasion. Overall, we found that plant invasion had significant impacts on the activities of seven types of soil enzymes. Plant invasion had inconsistent impacts on C-decomposing enzymes, but invaded sites had significantly higher activities of soil enzymes related to N- and P-release than noninvaded sites. Increases in nutrient-releasing enzyme activity after plant invasion ranged from +23% to +69%, which potentially results in a linear increase of soil nutrient availability in response to enhanced enzyme activities. Invaded soils also had higher nutrient stocks and soil microbial biomass than uninvaded soils. Our results suggest that enhanced activity of soil nutrient-releasing enzymes after plant invasion may accelerate nutrient cycling, potentially creating a nutrient-rich soil environment that benefits invaders and promotes their persistence, as invasive plants often appear to be more resource-demanding and competitive than native species.

AB Life-history traits of individuals in marine populations exhibit large sources of variability. In marine fish, variation of individual size at a given age has three main components: (1) spatial, correlated with the location in which individuals are caught, (2) temporal, correlated with the time when individuals are caught, and (3) generational, correlated with the year of birth of the examined individuals. These variations, if present, have practical implications for individual fitness as well as for sampling, survey design, and population assessment. Disentangling these variations and understanding their sources is hard, given the potentially correlated nature of their effects on individual traits. This study examines the size-at-age relationship of the Bering Sea Pacific cod, an economically and ecologically important groundfish. We used extensive records spanning 1994 to 2016 (inclusive) of 25,213 observations of both environmental variables and catch, lengths, and ages. We found that the average size of individuals of the same age could differ up to 7 cm. Notably, we found that the cohort composition of the sampled population explained >75% of the year effect and that individuals caught in the northwest and shallower portion of the sampling area were on average 5 cm smaller than individuals caught in the southern and deeper portion. We further found that northwest movement of young cod (age 1-5) as a result of warming places individuals in areas where we predict them to have smaller size at age. Smaller and less conditioned individuals are less fecund and may not be able to perform long migrations to return to their distant spawning grounds. Both the spatial distribution and water temperature experienced by Pacific cod in the Bering Sea are changing, and this study provides a mechanism for how these changes affect Pacific cod life-history traits and individual fitness.

AB Parasites are more diverse and numerous than their hosts and commonly control population dynamics. Whether parasites also regulate key ecosystem processes, such as resistance to climate stress, is unclear. In southern U.S. salt marshes, drought interacts synergistically with keystone grazing to generate extensive ecosystem die-off. Field manipulations of parasite prevalence and salt stress in sediments in healthy marshes demonstrated that trematode parasites, by suppressing feeding activity of grazers that overgraze on drought-stressed plants, have the potential to slow the rate of ecosystem loss. Surveys along 1,000 km of coastline during an intense drought event revealed parasitism is common in grazers on die-off borders and that increasing infection prevalence along marsh die-off borders is negatively correlated with per capita grazing. Combined, results from this field experiment and survey suggested, but did not show, that parasites could affect rates of drought-driven salt marsh die-off. To test whether parasites can indeed protect marshes under real drought conditions, we experimentally manipulated parasite prevalence in grazers over a month-long period on active die-off borders in three North Carolina marshes. Experimentally reducing parasite prevalence markedly increased the rate of plant ecosystem decline, an effect that scaled positively with prevalence. Thus parasites, by generating a trophic cascade, indirectly enhanced ecosystem resistance to overgrazing under intense drought in these North Carolina marshes. The generality of these results across the entire range of this keystone grazer in the southeastern United States needs to be tested, employing both experiments and extensive surveys that examine how the rate of ecosystem decline is mediated by parasitism. Given the ubiquity of parasites in ecosystems, our results suggest that more research effort should be invested in examining the possible roles for parasitism in regulating ecosystem function and stability.

AB The aim of this research is to compile a database of vascular plants found in the Kingdom of Tonga in western Polynesia, a phyto-geographic subregion of the South Pacific. The Tongan islands are spread over 600,000 km(2) of the Pacific Ocean between 15-23 degrees S latitude and 173-177 degrees W longitude. The archipelago is comprised of 171 islands with an aggregate land area of about 720 km(2). Since there is no comprehensive or updated flora for Tonga, we use 143 published sources to compile a database for 1,020 plant species, of which more than 450 are indigenous to these islands. Tonga is noteworthy for its low proportion of endemics, accounting for <5% of the indigenous species and <2% of the total plant species. Our database documents species presence in Tonga as a whole, and more specifically on 11 Tongan islands or island groups. We have assembled ecological information for each plant species according to growth form, vegetation type, origin (endemic, indigenous, and introduced species), and dispersal mechanisms. We include introduced species in our database because they represent over half of the plant species growing in Tonga. Species origins reflect human alteration of Tongan ecosystems in which endemic and indigenous species represent pre-human vegetation and introduced species indicate plants brought by either Polynesian or European settlers. For example, on Tongatapu, the largest and longest occupied island, more than half the plants are introduced, whereas on the sparsely populated, more remote islands, 70-90% of the species are indigenous. Dispersal mechanisms, which may include more than one mechanism per species, are documented in over 100 publications. Our database provides information on the whole suite of plant dispersal mechanisms over entire communities or island groups in Tonga. Plant species dispersal differs across environmental variables, including island geology, topography, vegetation type, and species origin. The older limestone islands have more bird, water, and human-dispersed plants, while the youngest volcanic islands have the most wind-dispersed species. Our database documents plant species endemism, introductions, vegetation types and dispersal mechanisms that reveal key biogeographic dynamics of the Tongan archipelago in the South Pacific.

AB Understanding the links between intraspecific trait variability and environmental gradients is an important step toward unravelling the mechanisms that link species performance to environmental variation. Here, we performed a comparative, experimental study to investigate variability of cellular traits in three prokaryotic and three eukaryotic freshwater phytoplankton species along gradients of temperature and nitrogen:phosphorus ratio (N:P) in laboratory microcosms. Temperature and N:P strongly affect phytoplankton growth and are changing due to climate change and eutrophication. Metabolic theory and allometric scaling predict that smaller organisms should be favored at higher temperatures through improved metabolic uptake partly due to greater surface area to volume ratios. In addition, chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration should increase due to higher chlorophyll synthesis in response to light limitation at higher cell densities. We found that cell volume both increased and decreased with temperature, whereas intermediate N:P yielded higher growth rates and more extreme conditions yielded bigger cell volumes. Species growth responses to these gradients were distinct and not related to phylogenetic differences. Meaningfully coupled traits like the chl a fluorescence and cell volume shifted consistently and can improve our understanding of individual cell responses to abiotic drivers. This study showed that intraspecific trait variability of freshwater phytoplankton harbors potential for short term acclimation to environmental gradients. Finally, the high trait variability in some species has strong implications for their ecology and the accuracy of predictions where responses may differ when based on mean or fixed trait values.

Chytridiomycota (chytrids) infect a wide host range, including phytoplankton species that form the basis of aquatic food webs and produce roughly half of Earth's oxygen. However, blooms of large or toxic phytoplankton form trophic bottlenecks, as they are inedible to zooplankton. Chytrids infecting inedible phytoplankton provide a trophic link to zooplankton by producing edible zoospores of high nutritional quality. By grazing chytrid zoospores, zooplankton may induce a trophic cascade, as a decreased zoospore density will reduce new infections. Conversely, fewer infections will not produce enough zoospores to sustain long-term zooplankton growth and reproduction. This intricate balance between zoospore density necessary for zooplankton energetic demands (growth/survival), and the loss in new infections (and thus new zoospores) because of grazing was tested empirically. To this end, we exposed a cyanobacterial host (Planktothrix rubescens) infected by a chytrid (Rizophydium megarrhizum) to a grazer density gradient (the rotifer Keratella cf. cochlearis). Rotifers survived and reproduced on a zoospore diet, but the Keratella population growth was limited by the amount of zoospores provided by chytrid infections, resulting in a situation where zooplankton survived but were restricted in their ability to control disease in the cyanobacterial host. We subsequently developed and parameterized a dynamical food-chain model using an allometric relationship for clearance rate to assess theoretically the potential of different-sized zooplankton groups to restrict disease in phytoplankton hosts. Our model suggests that smaller-sized zooplankton may have a high potential to reduce chytrid infections on inedible phytoplankton. Together, our results point out the complexity of three-way interactions between hosts, parasites, and grazers and highlight that trophic cascades are not always sustainable and may depend on the grazer's energetic demand.

AB In an era of rapid climate change, and with it concern over insect declines, we used two theories to predict 20-yr changes in 34 North American ant communities. The ecosystems, from deserts to hardwood forests, were first surveyed in the 1990s. When resurveyed in 2016-2017, they averaged 1 degrees C warmer with 200 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1) higher plant productivity. Ant colony abundance changed from -49% to +61%. Consistent with Thermal Performance Theory, colony abundance increased with temperature increases < 1 degrees C, then decreased as a site's mean monthly temperature change increased up to +2.4 degrees C. Consistent with Species Energy Theory, (1) ant abundance tracked changes in a measure of energy availability (net aboveground productivity, g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) and (2) increases in colony abundance drove increases in local plot- and transect-level species richness but not that of Chao 2, an estimate of the size of the species pool. Even after accounting for these drivers, local species richness was still higher similar to 20 yr after the original surveys, likely due to the increased activity of ant workers. These results suggest community changes are predictable using theory from geographical ecology, and that warming can first enhance but may ultimately decrease the abundance of this important insect taxon.

AB The probability of extreme weather events is increasing, with the potential for widespread impacts to plants, plant communities, and ecosystems. Reports of drought-related tree mortality are becoming more frequent, and there is increasing evidence that drought accompanied by high temperatures is especially detrimental. Simultaneously, extreme large precipitation events have become more frequent over the past century. Water-limited ecosystems may be more vulnerable to these extreme events than other ecosystems, especially when pushed outside of their historical range of variability. However, drought-related mortality of shrubs-an important component of dryland vegetation-remains understudied relative to tree mortality. In 2014, a landscape-scale die-off of the widespread shrub, big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.), was reported in southwest Wyoming, following extreme hot and dry conditions in 2012 and extremely high precipitation in September of 2013. Here we examine how severe drought, extreme precipitation, soil texture and salinity, and shrub-stand characteristics contributed to this die-off event. At 98 plots within and around the die-off, we quantified big sagebrush mortality, characterized soil texture and salinity, and simulated soil-water conditions from 1916 to 2016 using an ecosystem water-balance model. We found that the extreme weather conditions alone did not explain patterns of big sagebrush mortality and did not result in extreme (historically unprecedented) soil-water conditions during the drought. Instead, plots with chronically dry soil conditions experienced greatest mortality following the global change-type (hot) drought in 2012. Furthermore, mortality was greater in locations with high potential run-on and low potential run-off where saturated soil conditions were simulated in September 2013, suggesting that extreme precipitation also played an important role in the die-off in these locations. In locations where drought alone contributed to mortality, stem density negatively impacted big sagebrush. In locations that may have been affected by both drought and saturation, however, mortality was greatest where stem density was lowest, suggesting that these locations may have already been less favorable to big sagebrush. Paradoxically, vulnerability to both extreme events (drought and saturation) was associated with finer-textured soils, and our results highlight the importance of soils in determining local variation of the vulnerability of dryland plants to extreme events.

AB Within the context of species distribution models, scrutiny arises from the choice of meaningful environmental predictors. Thermal conditions are not the sole driver, but are the most widely acknowledged abiotic driver of plant life within alpine ecosystems. We linked long-term measurements of direct, plant-relevant, near-surface temperatures to plant species frequency. Across 47 sites located along environmental gradients within the Scandinavian mountain chain, the thermal preferences of 26 focal species of vascular plants, lichens, and bryophytes were explored. Based on partial least-squares regression, we applied a relative importance analysis to derive inductively the thermal variables that were best related to a species' frequency. To discover potential seasonal variability of thermal controls, analyses were both differentiated according to meteorological season and integrated across the entire year. The pronounced interspecies and temporal variability of thermal constraints revealed the thermal niches were much more nuanced and variable than they have commonly been represented. This finding challenges us to present, interrogate, and interpret data representing these thermal niches, which seems to be required in order to move beyond purely probabilistic and correlative descriptions of species' range limits. Thus, this information will help improve predictions of species distributions in complex arctic-alpine landscapes.

AB Geographic plant distribution is often assumed to be predominantly limited directly by the climatic tolerances of species. However, the role of climate is now known to be mainly an indirect one mostly mediating dispersal and establishment, species interactions, or habitat characteristics, which all are often modified by human land use. In these complex systems, negative biotic interactions are predicted to increase in relative importance toward benign climatic conditions. We tested this hypothesis experimentally by exposing plant species with different geographic distribution ranges to different climates, biotic interactions, and land use. Thereby, species predominantly distributed in regions with benign climatic conditions were expected to be better able to cope with negative biotic interactions than species from regions with environmentally stressful climatic conditions. We present results of a fully crossed two-year transplantation field experiment replicated in 45 plots in three study regions along a precipitation gradient across Germany. We manipulated biotic interactions (presence/absence of competition and mollusk herbivory) in grasslands of different management regimes (meadows, mown pastures, pastures). The transplanted phytometers consisted of six congeneric species pairs, each representing one oceanic and one distinctly more continental range type. The oceanic range type is predominantly distributed in benign climatic conditions in Western Europe, while the more continental type is distributed in regions with more stressful climatic conditions in Eastern Europe. This experimental setting allowed us to study the impact of negative biotic interactions along an abiotic stress gradient under realistic land-use conditions. Under competition and mollusk herbivory, growth performance was more strongly reduced in continental compared to oceanic species. Range types also differed in their responses to grassland management. Differences in survival between the congeneric species were found to be region-specific and largely unaffected by biotic interactions and land use. In consequence, our results suggest that local responses to biotic interactions and land-use practices of otherwise very similar plant species can differ strongly depending on species' large-scale geographical distribution. Regionally differing responses to biotic interactions also show that local conditions can drastically change responses expected from macroecological theory.

AB Large rain events drive dramatic resource pulses and the complex pulse-reserve dynamics of arid ecosystems change between high-rain years and drought. However, arid-zone animal responses to short-term changes in climate are unknown, particularly smaller rain events that briefly interrupt longer-term drought. Using arthropods as model animals, we determined the effects of a small rain event on arthropod abundance in western New South Wales, Australia during a longer-term shift toward drought. Arthropod abundance decreased over 2 yr, but captures of 10 out of 15 ordinal taxa increased dramatically after the small rain event (<40 mm). The magnitude of increases ranged from 10.4 million% (collembolans) to 81% (spiders). After 3 months, most taxa returned to prerain abundance. However, small soil-dwelling beetles, mites, spiders, and collembolans retained high abundances despite the onset of winter temperatures and lack of subsequent rain. As predicted by pulse-reserve models, most arid-zone arthropod populations declined during drought. However, small rain events may play a role in buffering some taxa from declines during longer-term drought or other xenobiotic influences. We outline the framework for a new model of animal responses to environmental conditions in the arid zone, as some species clearly benefit from rain inputs that do not dramatically influence primary productivity.

AB Understanding and modeling of how forest composition and pattern are recorded by sedimentary pollen assemblages requires data sets in which modern pollen assemblages are paired with forest-composition data across a range of spatial scales. Pollen data from 33 small lakes (<2.0 ha) in the northeastern United States, paired with estimates of forest composition and basal area by species within successive radial distances from the lake margins (0-20, 20-50, 50-100, 100-500, 500-1,000 m), can support further studies of pollen-vegetation relationships and development of calibration models.

AB Seed mucilage, a coating on seeds or fruit that becomes slimy and sticky when wet, has evolved convergently many times across plants. One common consequence of having seed mucilage is that sand and dirt particles stick to wet seeds and remain tightly bound to the seed surface after the mucilage dries. Here, we test the hypothesis that a mucilage-bound sand coating protects the seed from seed predators; either as a physical barrier or by reducing apparency of the seed (i.e., camouflage). We experimentally manipulated the sand coating on seeds of 53 plant species of 13 families and assayed the defensive benefit of the sand coating in feeding "depots" near harvester ant nests in California's Central Valley. Consistent with a defensive function, sand coating reduced ant predation on seeds in 48 of the 53 species examined. To test whether this striking benefit was due to reduced apparency, we conducted an addition experiment using flax seeds in which we factorially manipulated the color of both the background substrate and the sand coating, creating visually apparent and unapparent seeds. Our results did not support the reduced apparency hypothesis; seeds coated in background-matched sand were removed at the same rate as seeds coated in unmatched sand. The defensive benefit of a sand coating was not well-predicted by seed mass, entrapped sand mass, or sand mass scaled by seed mass. Together, our results demonstrate that seed mucilage is a phylogenetically widespread and effective seed defensive trait and point to the physical barrier, not reduced apparency, as a mechanism.

AB Kelp forests are known as key habitats for species diversity and macroalgal productivity; however, we know little about how these biogenic habitats interact with seawater chemistry and phototroph productivity in the water column. We examined kelp forest functions at three locales along the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state by quantifying carbonate chemistry, nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton productivity, and seawater microbial communities inside and outside of kelp beds dominated by the canopy kelp species Nereocystis luetkeana and Macrocystis pyrifera. Kelp beds locally increased the pH, oxygen, and aragonite saturation state of the seawater, but lowered seawater inorganic carbon content and total alkalinity. Although kelp beds depleted nitrate and phosphorus concentrations, ammonium and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were enhanced. Kelp beds also decreased chlorophyll concentrations and carbon fixed by phytoplankton, although kelp carbon fixation more than compensated for any difference in phytoplankton production. Kelp beds entrained distinct microbial communities, with higher taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity compared to seawater outside of the kelp bed. Kelp forests thus had significant effects on seawater chemistry, productivity and the microbial assemblages in their proximity. Thereby, the diversity of pathways for carbon and nitrogen cycling was also enhanced. Overall, these observations suggest that the contribution of kelp forests to nearshore carbon and nitrogen cycling is greater than previously documented.

TI FragSAD: A database of diversity and species abundance distributions
   from habitat fragments

DT Article; Data Paper

AB Habitat destruction is the single greatest anthropogenic threat to biodiversity. Decades of research on this issue have led to the accumulation of hundreds of data sets comparing species assemblages in larger, intact, habitats to smaller, more fragmented, habitats. Despite this, little synthesis or consensus has been achieved, primarily because of non-standardized sampling methodology and analyses of notoriously scale-dependent response variables (i.e., species richness). To be able to compare and contrast the results of habitat fragmentation on species' assemblages, it is necessary to have the underlying data on species abundances and sampling intensity, so that standardization can be achieved. To accomplish this, we systematically searched the literature for studies where abundances of species in assemblages (of any taxa) were sampled from many habitat patches that varied in size. From these, we extracted data from several studies, and contacted authors of studies where appropriate data were collected but not published, giving us 117 studies that compared species assemblages among habitat fragments that varied in area. Less than one-half (41) of studies came from tropical forests of Central and South America, but there were many studies from temperate forests and grasslands from all continents except Antarctica. Fifty-four of the studies were on invertebrates (mostly insects), but there were several studies on plants (15), birds (16), mammals (19), and reptiles and amphibians (13). We also collected qualitative information on the length of time since fragmentation. With data on total and relative abundances (and identities) of species, sampling effort, and affiliated meta-data about the study sites, these data can be used to more definitively test hypotheses about the role of habitat fragmentation in altering patterns of biodiversity. There are no copyright restrictions. Please cite this data paper and the associated Dryad data set if the data are used in publications.

AB Early-life environmental conditions may generate cohort differences in individual fitness, subsequently affecting population growth rates. Three, nonmutually exclusive hypotheses predict the nature of these fitness differences: (1) silver spoon effects, where individuals born in good conditions perform better across the range of adult environments; (2) the "environmental saturation" hypothesis, where fitness differences only occur in intermediate adult environmental conditions; and (3) the "environmental matching" or "predictive adaptive response" (PAR) hypothesis, where fitness is highest when adult environmental conditions match those experienced in early life. We quantified the context-dependent effect of early-life environment on subsequent reproductive success, survival, and population growth rate (lambda) of Svalbard reindeer, and explored how well it was explained by the three hypotheses. We found that good early-life conditions increased reproductive success compared to poor early-life conditions, but only when experiencing intermediate adult environmental conditions. This is the first example of what appears to be both "beneficial" and "detrimental environmental saturation" in a natural system. Despite weak early-life effects on survival, cohorts experiencing good early-life conditions contributed to higher population growth rates, when simulating realistic variation in adult environmental conditions. Our results show how the combination of a highly variable environment and biological constraints on fitness components can suppress silver spoon effects at both extremes of the adult environmental gradient.

   CONTEXT
AB Under a metacommunity framework, the spatial configuration of habitat fragments could determine local community structure. Yet, quantifying fragment connectivity is challenging, as it depends on multiple variables at several geographical scales. We assessed the extent to which fragment connectivity and area explain patterns in interaction structure among four herbivore guilds and their host plants in a metacommunity. We propose an integrative connectivity metric including geographic distance, neighboring fragment area and similarity in resource composition as an extension of Hanski's classic metric. We then used nonlinear models to assess whether fragment connectivity and area predicted link richness and similarity in link composition. We found that link richness was always negatively related to connectivity but at different geographic scales depending on the herbivore guild. In contrast, while link composition was also related to connectivity, the direction and strength of this relationship varied among herbivore guilds and type of link composition (qualitative or quantitative). Furthermore, focal fragment area was not an important determinant of interaction diversity in local communities. Our findings emphasize resource similarity as a novel dimension of fragment connectivity relevant in explaining interaction diversity patterns in natural trophic networks.

TI Poor nutrition as a potential cause of divergent tree growth near the
   Arctic treeline in northern Alaska

AB Trees growing near the Arctic treeline have long been used to reconstruct past climates. However, recent studies have shown deterioration of historically strong positive correlations between air temperature and tree growth (known as "divergence"). Divergence has important implications for confidence in paleoclimate reconstructions and ecosystem-atmosphere carbon exchange. Studies in the Brooks Range of northern Alaska showed that white spruce in the west increased growth in response to late 20th century warming, whereas those in the east failed to show a growth increase. In an earlier study across four watersheds in the Brooks Range, we tested and rejected the hypothesis that divergence in the easternmost watershed reflects moisture limitation of growth. Here, using 16 sites distributed across the same four watersheds, we tested an alternative hypothesis, that greater nutrient limitation in the east may have impeded positive growth responses to warming. Climate comparison across the four Brooks Range study watersheds revealed that, although the easternmost watershed generally had a drier growing-season climate, the most consistent difference was that winter air temperature and both winter and summer soil temperatures were much colder in the central and eastern watersheds. Soil nutrient availability, foliar nutrient concentrations, and tree growth were all generally lower in the central and eastern than in the western watersheds. Foliar phosphorus concentration was the best predictor of spatial variation in branch extension growth-a finding that is somewhat inconsistent with the theory that forest productivity on young, glacially derived soils should be strongly nitrogen limited. Experimental fertilization yielded the greatest growth increase in the eastern, an intermediate response in the central, and the smallest growth increase in the western watershed, generally mirroring trends in soil temperature, soil nutrient availability, foliar nutrient concentrations, and growth of control trees. Our results confirm that growth in the easternmost watershed is more nutrient limited and suggest that phosphorus limitation may be at least as important as nitrogen limitation of growth. We hypothesize that cold soil effects on tree access to nutrients might explain divergence in the eastern Brooks Range and elsewhere near the Arctic treeline, particularly in areas with cold winters and widespread permafrost.

AB Resource competition theory predicts that when two species compete for a single, finite resource, the better competitor should exclude the other. However, in some cases, weaker competitors can persist through intraguild predation, that is, by eating their stronger competitor. Mixotrophs, species that meet their carbon demand by combining photosynthesis and phagotrophic heterotrophy, may function as intraguild predators when they consume the phototrophs with which they compete for light. Thus, theory predicts that mixotrophy may allow for coexistence of two species on a single limiting resource. We tested this prediction by developing a new mathematical model for a unicellular mixotroph and phytoplankter that compete for light, and comparing the model's predictions with a laboratory experimental system. We find that, like other intraguild predators, mixotrophs can persist when an ecosystem is sufficiently productive (i.e., the supply of the limiting resource, light, is relatively high), or when species interactions are strong (i.e., attack rates and conversion efficiencies are high). Both our mathematical and laboratory models show that, depending upon the environment and species traits, a variety of equilibrium outcomes, ranging from competitive exclusion to coexistence, are possible.

AB Many insect herbivores are vectors that transmit plant pathogens as they forage. Within food webs, vectors interact with a range of host plants, other herbivores, and predators. Yet, few studies have examined how tri-trophic interactions involving vectors affect the spread of pathogens. Here we assessed effects of food web structure on aphid vectors and the prevalence of an aphid-borne persistent pathogen (Pea enation mosaic virus, PEMV) in pea plants. We experimentally manipulated ladybird predators, alternative host plants, and non-vector herbivores and assessed responses of pea aphids and PEMV using structural equation models. We show that variation in bottom-up, top-down, and horizontal interactions mediated PEMV prevalence. Predators reduced PEMV prevalence by consuming aphids, but an alternative host plant (vetch) had the opposite effect by promoting aphid movement and abundance. Non-vector herbivores (pea leaf weevil) increased PEMV susceptibility in peas. In turn, weevils offset the positive effects of predators on PEMV, but increased the negative effects of vetch. Our results show that tri-trophic interactions within insect and plant food webs can mediate vector biology with synergistic and opposing effects on pathogens. Continuing to assess how community-wide interactions affect vectors will aid in our understanding of vector-borne pathosystems.

AB In 2014, a DNA-based phylogenetic study confirming the paraphyly of the grass subtribe Sporobolinae proposed the creation of a large monophyletic genus Sporobolus, including (among others) species previously included in the genera Spartina, Calamovilfa, and Sporobolus. Spartina species have contributed substantially (and continue contributing) to our knowledge in multiple disciplines, including ecology, evolutionary biology, molecular biology, biogeography, experimental ecology, biological invasions, environmental management, restoration ecology, history, economics, and sociology. There is no rationale so compelling to subsume the name Spartina as a subgenus that could rival the striking, global iconic history and use of the name Spartina for over 200 yr. We do not agree with the subjective arguments underlying the proposal to change Spartina to Sporobolus. We understand the importance of both the objective phylogenetic insights and of the subjective formalized nomenclature and hope that by opening this debate we will encourage positive feedback that will strengthen taxonomic decisions with an interdisciplinary perspective. We consider that the strongly distinct, monophyletic clade Spartina should simply and efficiently be treated as the genus Spartina.

AB Niche-based theories and the neutral theory of biodiversity differ in their predictions of how the species composition of natural communities will respond to changes in nutrient availability. This is an issue of major environmental relevance, as many ecosystems have experienced changes in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) due to anthropogenic manipulation of nutrient loading. To understand how changes in N and P limitation may impact community structure, we conducted laboratory competition experiments using a multispecies phytoplankton community sampled from the North Sea. Results showed that picocyanobacteria (Cyanobium sp.) won the competition under N limitation, while picocyanobacteria and nonmotile nanophytoplankton (Nannochloropsis sp.) coexisted at equal abundances under P limitation. Additional experiments using isolated monocultures confirmed that Cyanobium sp. depleted N to lower levels than Nannochloropsis sp., but that both species had nearly identical P requirements, suggesting a potential for neutral coexistence under P-limited conditions. Pairwise competition experiments with the two isolates seemed to support the consistency of these results, but P limitation resulted in stable species coexistence irrespective of the initial conditions rather than the random drift of species abundances predicted by neutral theory. Comparison of the light absorption spectra indicates that coexistence of the two species was stabilized through differential use of the underwater light spectrum. Our results provide an interesting experimental example of modern coexistence theory, where species were equal competitors in one niche dimension but their competitive traits differed in other niche dimensions, thus enabling stable species coexistence on a single limiting nutrient through niche differentiation in the light spectrum.

ID DIFFERENTIATION MEASURES; CONSUMERS GUIDE; INDEXES; DEPENDENCE
AB An enormous number of measures based on different criteria have been proposed to quantify evenness or unevenness among species relative abundances in an assemblage. However, a unified approach that can encompass most of the widely used indices is still lacking. Here, we first present some basic requirements for an evenness measure. We then propose that unevenness among species relative abundances in an assemblage can be measured by a normalized divergence between the vector of species relative abundances and the mean vector, where the mean vector represents the species relative abundances of a completely even assemblage. Thus, evenness among species relative abundances is measured by the corresponding normalized extent of closeness between these two vectors. We consider five divergence measures, leading to five classes of evenness indices. All our evenness measures are in terms of diversity (Hill number) of order q > 0 (here q controls the weighting of species relative abundances) and species richness (diversity of order q = 0). We propose quantifying evenness through a continuous profile that depicts evenness as a function of diversity order q > 0. The profiles can be easily and visually compared across multiple assemblages. Our evenness indices satisfy all the requirements presented in this paper and encompass many widely used evenness measures as special cases. When there are multiple assemblages, the abundance-based Jaccard- and Sorensen-type dissimilarity measures (which are monotonic functions of beta diversity) can be expressed as weighted averages of the individual species' compositional unevenness values; here, each individual species' compositional unevenness is calculated based on that species' abundances among assemblages. The contribution of a species to each dissimilarity measure can be clearly disentangled and quantified in terms of this single species' compositional unevenness among assemblages. Thus, our framework links the concepts of evenness, diversity, beta diversity, and similarity. Moreover, the framework can be readily extended to a phylogenetic version. A real data example is used to illustrate our approach. We also discuss some criteria and other measures that were previously proposed in the literature.

AB Forest ecosystems in eastern North America have been in flux for the last several thousand years, well before Euro-American land clearance and the 20th-century onset of anthropogenic climate change. However, the magnitude and uncertainty of prehistoric vegetation change have been difficult to quantify because of the multiple ecological, dispersal, and sedimentary processes that govern the relationship between forest composition and fossil pollen assemblages. Here we extend STEPPS, a Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal pollen-vegetation model, to estimate changes in forest composition in the upper Midwestern United States from about 2,100 to 300 yr ago. Using this approach, we find evidence for large changes in the relative abundance of some species, and significant changes in community composition. However, these changes took place against a regional background of changes that were small in magnitude or not statistically significant, suggesting complexity in the spatiotemporal patterns of forest dynamics. The single largest change is the infilling of Tsuga canadensis in northern Wisconsin over the past 2,000 yr. Despite range infilling, the range limit of T. canadensis was largely stable, with modest expansion westward. The regional ecotone between temperate hardwood forests and northern mixed hardwood/conifer forests shifted southwestward by 15-20 km in Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin. Fraxinus, Ulmus, and other mesic hardwoods expanded in the Big Woods region of southern Minnesota. The increasing density of paleoecological data networks and advances in statistical modeling approaches now enables the confident detection of subtle but significant changes in forest composition over the last 2,000 yr.

AB Global change stressors such as drought and plant invasion can affect ecosystem structure and function via mediation of resource availability and plant competition outcomes. Yet, it remains uncertain how native plants respond to drought stress that co-occurs with potentially novel resource conditions created by a nonnative invader. Further, there is likely to be temporal variation in competition outcomes between native and nonnative plant species depending on which resources are most limiting at a given time. Interacting stressors coupled with temporal variation make it difficult to predict how global change will impact native plant communities. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a 5-yr factorial field experiment to quantify how simulated drought, plant invasion (by cogongrass, Imperata cylindrica), and these stressors combined, affected resource availability (soil moisture and light) and competition dynamics between the invader and native longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), a foundation species in southeast U.S. forests. Drought and invasion mediated the survival and performance of pine seedlings in temporally dynamic and unexpected ways. Drought and invasion alone each significantly reduced pine seedling survival. However, when the stressors occurred together, the invader offset drought stress for pine seedlings by maintaining high levels of soil moisture, humidity, and shade compared to uninvaded vegetation. This facilitative effect was pronounced for 2 yr, yet shifted to strong competitive exclusion as the invasion progressed and the limiting resource switched from soil moisture to light. After 3 yr, pine tree survival was low except for pines growing with uninvaded vegetation under ambient precipitation conditions. After 5 yr, pines experiencing a single stressor were taller and had greater height to diameter ratios than pines under no stress or both stressors. This outcome revealed a filtering effect where poorly performing trees were culled under stressful conditions, especially when pines were growing with the invader. Together, these results demonstrate that although drought and invasion suppressed a foundation tree species, the invader temporarily moderated stressful drought conditions, and at least some trees were able to survive despite increasingly strong competition. Such unpredictable effects of interacting global change stressors on native plant species highlight the need for additional long-term studies.

AB Western Amazonia is a global biodiversity hotspot that encompasses extensive variation in geologic, climatic, and biotic features. Palms (Arecaceae) are among the most diverse and iconic groups of plants in the region with more than 150 species that exhibit extraordinary variation of geographical distributions, regional abundance patterns, and life history strategies and growth forms, and provide myriad ecosystem services. Understanding the ecological and evolutionary drivers that underpin palm distribution and abundance patterns may shed light on the evolution and ecology of the tropical forest biomes more generally. Edaphic conditions, in particular, are increasingly recognized as critical drivers of tropical plant diversity and distributions but data deficiencies inhibit our understanding of plant-soil relationships at broad scales, especially in the tropics. We present data from 546, 0.25-ha (5 x 500 m) georeferenced transects located throughout western Amazonia where all individual palms were identified, counted, and assigned to a life-history stage. Several environmental covariates were recorded along each transect and surface soil samples were collected from multiple points in N = 464 of transects. Altogether, the transects include 532,602 individuals belonging to 135 species. Variation among transects in terms of palm species richness and abundance is associated with major habitat types and soil properties. The soil properties including pH, acidity, all macronutrients for all samples, and texture, carbon, nitrogen, and micronutrients for some transects vary substantially across the study area, providing insight to broad-scale variation of tropical surface soils. The data provided here will help advance our understanding of plant distributions and abundance patterns, and associations with soil conditions. No copyright restrictions are associated with this data set but please cite this paper if data are used for publication.

AB Direct and indirect defenses are predicted to trade-off due to costs associated with redundancy in plant defense, but the factors mediating a plant's position along this trade-off axis are unknown. We conducted a bird exclusion experiment of nine sympatric shrub species to assess convergent associations among direct defense, indirect defense from birds, and shrub structural complexity, a trait predicted to influence bird foraging. We found high variation in defense; direct resistance varied four-fold, with indirect defense ranging from a 59% reduction to a 32% increase in herbivore density. These resistance strategies traded off and were mediated by plant structure; high complexity was associated with weaker indirect defense from birds, strong direct defense, and more predatory arthropods. Our findings suggest that species with growth forms that inhibit bird foraging invest more in direct defense and may provide refuge for arthropod predators. Accordingly, we provide evidence for a potentially widespread mechanism underlying the evolution of plant defenses.

AB Social dispersal is an important feature of population dynamics. When female mammals occur in polygynous groups, their dispersal decisions are conditioned by various female-, male-, and group-related factors. Among them, the influence of disease often remains difficult to assess. To address this challenge, we used long-term monitoring data from two gorilla populations (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) affected by infectious skin disease lesions. After controlling for other potentially influential factors, we investigated to which extent disease avoidance drives the dispersal decisions of gorilla females. We showed that the infection of a silverback of a breeding group by the skin disease increased the probability of adult females to emigrate. Moreover, adult females avoided breeding groups with a high prevalence of skin disease by emigrating from them and immigrating into healthier ones. Age of the breeding group was also an important factor. Adult females left older groups, near the end of a male tenure, to join younger ones led by younger fully grown silverbacks that could be of high reproductive and protective value. Our study highlights that, although females select for high-quality males, disease avoidance is a critical driver of their dispersion decision.

AB Although direct tree demographic responses to drought are widely recognized, studies of drought-mediated changes in tree interactions are rare. We hypothesize that drought exacerbates soil-water limitation and intensifies competition for water, but reduces light limitation and competition for light. We predict that competition would be stronger for trees (1) consuming more water or more susceptible to water deficits during drought and (2) intercepting more light or more susceptible to shade during postdrought periods. We tested these predictions in a 50-ha tropical forest plot by quantifying the effects of neighborhood mean trait values on tree survival during versus after a severe drought. We used wood density (WD) and leaf mass per area (LMA) as proxies for water and light use strategies, respectively. Tree survival was lower, canopy loss was greater, and sapling recruitment was greater during the drought relative to postdrought census intervals. This suggests that drought pushed water deficits to lethal extremes and increased understory light availability. Relationships between survival and neighborhood WD were independent of drought, which is inconsistent with our first prediction. In contrast, relationships between survival and neighborhood LMA differed strongly with drought. Survival time was unaffected by neighborhood LMA during drought, but was longer for trees of all sizes in low-LMA neighborhoods in the postdrought census interval, consistent with the prediction of reduced competition for light during drought. Our results suggest that severe drought might increase light availability and reduce competition for light in moist tropical forests.

AB Environmental forces and biotic interactions, both positive and negative, structure ecological communities, but their relative roles remain obscure despite strong theory. For instance, ecologically similar species, based on the principle of limiting similarity, are expected to be most competitive and show negative interactions. Specious communities that assemble along broad environmental gradients afford the most power to test theory, but the communities often are difficult to quantify. Microbes, specifically fungal endophytes of wood, are especially suited for testing community assembly theory because they are relatively easy to sample across a comprehensive range of environmental space with clear axes of variation. Moreover, endophytes mediate key forest carbon cycle processes, and although saprophytic fungi from dead wood typically compete, endophytic fungi in living wood may enhance success through cooperative symbioses. To classify interactions within endophyte communities, we analyzed fungal DNA barcode variation across 22 woody plant species growing in woodlands near Richmond, New South Wales, Australia. We estimated the response of endophytes to the measured wood environment (i.e., 11 anatomical and chemical wood traits) and each other using latent-variable models and identified recurrent communities across wood environments using model-based classification. We used this information to evaluate whether (1) co-occurrence patterns are consistent with strong competitive exclusion, and (2) a priori classifications by trophic mode and phylum distinguish taxa that are more likely to have positive vs. negative associations under the principle of limiting similarity. Fungal endophytes were diverse (mean = 140 taxa/sample), with differences in community composition structured by wood traits. Variation in wood water content and carbon concentration were associated with especially large community shifts. Surprisingly, after accounting for wood traits, fungal species were still more than three times more likely to have positive than negative co-occurrence patterns. That is, patterns consistent with strong competitive exclusion were rare, and positive interactions among fungal endophytes were more common than expected. Confirming the frequency of positive vs. negative interactions among fungal taxa requires experimental tests, and our findings establish clear paths for further study. Evidence to date intriguingly suggests that, across a wide range of wood traits, cooperation may outweigh combat for these fungi.

AB Should we build our own phylogenetic trees based on gene sequence data, or can we simply use available synthesis phylogenies? This is a fundamental question that any study involving a phylogenetic framework must face at the beginning of the project. Building a phylogeny from gene sequence data (purpose-built phylogeny) requires more effort, expertise, and cost than subsetting an already available phylogeny (synthesis-based phylogeny). However, we still lack a comparison of how these two approaches to building phylogenetic trees influence common community phylogenetic analyses such as comparing community phylogenetic diversity and estimating trait phylogenetic signal. Here, we generated three purpose-built phylogenies and their corresponding synthesis-based trees (two from Phylomatic and one from the Open Tree of Life, OTL). We simulated 1,000 communities and 12,000 continuous traits along each purpose-built phylogeny. We then compared the effects of different trees on estimates of phylogenetic diversity (alpha and beta) and phylogenetic signal (Pagel's lambda and Blomberg's K). Synthesis-based phylogenies generally yielded higher estimates of phylogenetic diversity when compared to purpose-built phylogenies. However, resulting measures of phylogenetic diversity from both types of phylogenies were highly correlated (Spearman's rho > 0.8 in most cases). Mean pairwise distance (both alpha and beta) is the index that is most robust to the differences in tree construction that we tested. Measures of phylogenetic diversity based on the OTL showed the highest correlation with measures based on the purpose-built phylogenies. Trait phylogenetic signal estimated with synthesis-based phylogenies, especially from the OTL, was also highly correlated with estimates of Blomberg's K or close to Pagel's lambda from purpose-built phylogenies when traits were simulated under Brownian motion. For commonly employed community phylogenetic analyses, our results justify taking advantage of recently developed and continuously improving synthesis trees, especially the Open Tree of Life.

AB Nestedness and modularity have been recurrently observed in species interaction networks. Some studies argue that those topologies result from selection against unstable networks, and others propose that they likely emerge from processes driving the interactions between pairs of species. Here we present a model that simulates the evolution of consumer species using resource species following simple rules derived from the integrative hypothesis of specialization (IHS). Without any selection on stability, our model reproduced all commonly observed network topologies. Our simulations demonstrate that resource heterogeneity drives network topology. On the one hand, systems containing only homogeneous resources form generalized nested networks, in which generalist consumers have higher performance on each resource than specialists. On the other hand, heterogeneous systems tend to have a compound topology: modular with internally nested modules, in which generalists that divide their interactions between modules have low performance. Our results demonstrate that all real-world topologies likely emerge through processes driving interactions between pairs of species. Additionally, our simulations suggest that networks containing similar species differ from heterogeneous networks and that modules may not present the topology of entire networks.

AB Trait variation underlies our understanding of the patterns and importance of biodiversity, yet we have a poor understanding of how variation at different levels of biological organization structures communities and ecosystems. Here, we use a mesocosm experiment to test for the effects of a larval dragonfly functional trait on community and ecosystem dynamics by creating artificial populations to mirror within- and between-population trait variation observed in our study area. Specifically, we manipulate variation in activity rate, a key functional trait shaping food webs, across three levels of biological organization: within-populations (differences in trait variation in a population), among-populations (differences in population mean trait values), and among-species (species-level differences of co-occurring dragonflies). We show that differences in activity rate alter prey communities, trophic cascades, and multiple ecosystem processes. However, trait variation among populations had much larger effects than differences between co-occurring species or even the presence of a predator, whereas within-population variation had a relatively minor impact. Interestingly, combined with earlier work in the same system, our study suggests that the relative importance of species vs. individual level differences for ecosystem functioning will depend on the spatial scale considered. Ecological processes, including biodiversity-ecosystem-functioning relationships, cannot be understood without accounting for trait variation across biological scales of organization, including at fine scales.

AB Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are essential components of the basic cell structure of plants. In particular, leaf N and P concentrations and their stoichiometric relationship largely determine the photosynthesis, growth, reproduction, and ecophysiological processes of plants. As important leaf functional traits, leaf N and P concentrations and their stoichiometric relationship play vital roles in indicating plant nutrient-use strategies and their evolution in terrestrial ecosystems. They also influence physiological and ecological processes in leaves (e.g., growth rate and energy metabolism) and productivity (e.g., net primary production and net ecosystem production) at ecosystem level. However, the lack of a comprehensive data set containing paired leaf N and P concentration records has distinctly limited research on nutrient stoichiometry and leaf functional traits. Here, we provide a global database of paired records of leaf N and P concentrations. A total of 11,354 individual records were acquired spanning 1,291 sites worldwide, including 201 families, 1,265 genera, and 3,227 species. The records span a latitudinal range of 45.28 degrees S to 68.35 degrees N and a longitudinal range of 155.5 degrees W to 168.0 degrees E. The variables provided for each individual record are (1) geographical location (longitude, latitude, and altitude); (2) matched leaf N and P concentrations and N:P ratio; (3) taxonomic information (family, genera, and species); (4) life form (angiosperm/gymnosperm, monocotyledonous/dicotyledonous and woody plants/herbaceous plants; note that woody plants were further divided into coniferous, deciduous broad-leaved, and evergreen broad-leaved woody species and that herbaceous plants were further divided into annual and perennial species); (5) mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP); and (6) soil N and P concentrations and pH value in some records. To date, this database is the world's largest database of paired leaf N and P concentrations, which contains matched information of geographical location, environmental factors, and taxa. We believe that the database will play a fundamental and crucial part of ecological stoichiometric studies. There are no copyright restrictions. When using this database, we kindly request that you cite this article, respecting all the authors' hard work during sample collection and data compilation.

AB We identify changes in the functional composition of vascular epiphytes along a tropical elevational gradient with the aim of quantifying the role of climate in determining the assembly of epiphyte communities. We measured seven leaf functional traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf dry-matter content, leaf thickness, force to punch, stomatal density, and potential conductance index) in the 163 most abundant epiphyte species recorded across 10 sites located along an elevational gradient between 60 and 2,900 m above sea level in the Colombian Andes. We grouped the epiphyte species into seven hierarchical functional groups according to their most characteristic leaf traits. Along the elevational gradient, the two main independent leaf trait dimensions that distinguished community assemblages were defined primarily by leaf area-photosynthetic (LAPS) and mass-carbon (LMCS) gradients. Mean annual temperature was the main determinant of species position along LAPS. In contrast, local changes in specific leaf area due to variation in the epiphytes' relative height of attachment was the main determinant of their position along the LMCS. Our findings indicate that epiphytic plant leaves have evolved to optimize and enhance photosynthesis through a leaf area-based strategy and carbon acquisition through investments in construction costs of leaf area per unit of biomass that aim to regulate light capture and tissue development. Given that most studies of plant functional traits neglect vascular epiphytes, our quantification of the multiple dimensions of epiphyte leaf traits greatly augments our understanding of vascular plant function and adaptation to changing environments.

AB Increased drought intensity and frequency due to climate change may reduce the abundance and activity of nitrogen (N-2)-fixing plants, which supply new N to terrestrial ecosystems. As a result, drought may indirectly reduce ecosystem productivity through its effect on the N cycle. Here, we manipulated growing season net rainfall across a series of plots in an early successional mesic deciduous forest to understand how drought affects the aboveground productivity of the N-2-fixing tree Robinia pseudoacacia and three co-occurring nonfixing tree species. We found that lower soil moisture was associated with reduced productivity of R. pseudoacacia but not of nonfixing trees. As a result, the relative biomass and density of R. pseudoacacia declined in drier soils over time. Greater aboveground biomass of R. pseudoacacia was also associated with greater total soil N, extractable inorganic N, N mineralization rates, and productivity of nonfixing trees. These soil N effects may reflect current N-2 fixation by R. pseudoacacia saplings, or the legacy effect of former trees in the same location. Our results suggest that R. pseudoacacia promotes the growth of nonfixing trees in early succession through its effect on the N cycle. However, the sensitivity of R. pseudoacacia to dry soils may reduce N-2 fixation under scenarios of increasing drought intensity and frequency, demonstrating a mechanism by which drought may indirectly diminish potential forest productivity and recovery rate from disturbance.

AB Biodiversity inventories contain important information about species richness, community structure, and composition, and are the first step in developing any conservation and mitigation strategies. The Atlantic Forest of South America is home to around 334 species of small-, medium-, and large-sized mammals, and is currently restricted to less than 12% of its original cover. Here, we present the ATLANTIC MAMMALS, an open data set on information on medium- and large-sized mammal assemblages in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. A total of 129 studies were compiled, including published and in press peer-reviewed papers, book chapters, theses and unpublished data. We mapped 244 assemblages, eight orders, 63 genera, and 94 species (24 of which are classified as threatened by the IUCN Red List) distributed in 128 protected and 116 unprotected areas. Species richness of the mammalian assemblages varied from 1 to 39 species (mean 15). The most recorded species in the entire biome was Dasypus novemcinctus, followed by Cerdocyon thous and Procyon cancrivorous. These data can be useful in support of macroecological studies and conservation planning strategies. Please cite this data paper when the data are used in publications. We also request that researchers and teachers inform us of how they are using the data.

AB Sensitivity of plant species to individual arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal species is of primary importance to understanding the role of AM fungal diversity and composition in plant ecology. Currently, we do not have a predictive framework for understanding which plant species are sensitive to different AM fungal species. In two greenhouse studies, we tested for differences in plant sensitivity to different AM fungal species and mycorrhizal responsiveness across 17 grassland plant species of North America that varied in successional stage, native status, and plant family by growing plants with different AM fungal treatments including eight single AM fungal isolates, diverse mixtures of AM fungi, and non-inoculated controls. We found that late successional grassland plant species were highly responsive to AM fungi and exhibited stronger sensitivity in their response to individual AM fungal taxa compared to nonnative or early successional native grassland plant species. We confirmed these results using a meta-analysis that included 13 experiments, 37 plant species, and 40 fungal isolates (from nine publications and two greenhouse experiments presented herein). Mycorrhizal responsiveness and sensitivity of response (i.e., variation in plant biomass response to different AM fungal taxa) did not differ by the source of fungal inocula (i.e., local or not local) or plant family. Sensitivity of plant response to AM fungal species was consistently correlated with the average mycorrhizal response of that plant species. This study identifies that AM fungal identity is more important to the growth of late successional plant species than early successional or nonnative plant species, thereby predicting that AM fungal composition will be more important to plant community dynamics in late successional communities than in early successional or invaded plant communities.

AB Communities of free-living organisms are shaped by processes operating within and among patches of habitat, whereas pathogen communities are shaped by analogous processes operating within and among hosts. Resource competition (R*) theory can describe dynamics within patches or hosts, and metacommunity dynamics describe competition-colonization trade-offs, extinction debts, and superinfection. However, models at this broader scale often assume instantaneous competitive exclusion in co-inhabited patches or co-infected hosts. Impacts of more gradual competitive exclusion on the abundance, distribution, and diversity of species are less clear. Here, we nest a general resource competition model within a metacommunity framework and manipulate the relative timescales for processes operating within and among patches/hosts. We focus on superinfection in pathogen communities. We compare cases where transmission depends on infection prevalence vs. the abundance of pathogens within hosts. Surprisingly, slowing the relative pace of competitive exclusion within hosts can decrease infection prevalence of the inferior competitor and increase prevalence of the superior competitor, depending on transmission and virulence. Slower within-host dynamics reduce the abundance of both pathogens within hosts and promote diversity at multiple scales: co-infections within individual hosts and co-occurrence in the host population. These results highlight surprising feedbacks that can emerge across scales and reinforce the rich cross-scale connections between community and disease ecology.

AB Structure-function relationships are central to many ecological paradigms. Chief among these is the linkage of net primary production (NPP) with species diversity and canopy structure. Using the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) as a subcontinental-scale research platform, we examined how temperate-forest NPP relates to several measures of site-level canopy structure and tree species diversity. Novel multidimensional canopy traits describing structural complexity, most notably canopy rugosity, were more strongly related to site NPP than were species diversity measures and other commonly characterized canopy structural features. The amount of variation in site-level NPP explained by canopy rugosity alone was 83%, which was substantially greater than that explained individually by vegetation area index (31%) or Shannon's index of species diversity (30%). Forests that were more structurally complex, had higher vegetation-area indices, or were more diverse absorbed more light and used light more efficiently to power biomass production, but these relationships were most strongly tied to structural complexity. Implications for ecosystem modeling and management are wide ranging, suggesting structural complexity traits are broad, mechanistically robust indicators of NPP that, in application, could improve the prediction and management of temperate forest carbon sequestration.

AB Increasingly frequent and severe droughts under climate change are expected to have major impacts on vegetation worldwide. However, research to date has focused on tree vulnerability to drought in forests. Less is known about trees and drought in savannas, where a sparse tree layer coexists with grass. These tree-grass interactions (often mediated by fire and herbivory) shape savanna tree ecology, and confound predictions of how strongly drought might affect trees. On the one hand, drought is physiologically stressful, which could harm trees and be exacerbated by herbivore impacts; on the other hand, trees adapted to semiarid savannas might be relatively drought tolerant, and the considerable impacts of drought on grass could even benefit trees via reduced grass competition and fire risk, especially in the year following a drought. Here, we sought to understand the net effects of severe drought on the savanna tree layer, and how fire and herbivory mediate these effects. We monitored tree growth, mortality, and community structure for 2 yr within existing long-term fire and herbivory experiments across a drought-severity contrast, following a major drought in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Overall, severe drought was a major stressor for trees. Tree mortality rates in most species increased by an order of magnitude in the year following drought, and slower growth rates for some persisted for 2 yr. At the community level, this translated into substantial decreases in tree densities. Herbivory and fire did little either to mitigate or exacerbate drought effects on trees, and overall, drought swamped effects of herbivory and fire that have otherwise been observed. However, species differed in their responses to drought, with some dominant encroaching species especially vulnerable. We suggest that increasing drought frequency and severity could drastically alter savanna vegetation by repeatedly killing off trees.

AB Climate change and shifting species composition have influenced ecosystem-scale phenology worldwide. For instance, invasive plant species have greater vegetation phenological sensitivity to climate change than native plant species in some regions, and hence invasion could modify how ecosystem carbon gain responds to increased drought frequencies expected with climate change. Results from a 4-yr drought experiment show that invasion reduced ecosystem potential for carbon gain via increased sensitivity to reduced rainfall. Using canopy greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) as a proxy for potential ecosystem carbon gain, we show that areas invaded by herbaceous species had up to a 70% reduction in maximum NDVI under severe drought conditions as compared to areas dominated by native shrubs. Phenological differences between herbaceous- and shrub-dominated vegetation contributed to this reduction in potential ecosystem carbon gain because invaded areas had delayed green-up, especially under drought conditions, and shrub senescence was accelerated by drought. Hence, invasion by herbaceous species and increased drought frequencies are likely to act synergistically to reduce ecosystem capacity for carbon gain in this system. Our findings suggest that predicting ecosystem responses to future climate change could be improved by projecting of the spread of invasive species and accounting for phenological variation between native and invading species.

AB Nutrient availability and temperature are important drivers of phytoplankton growth and stoichiometry. However, the interactive effects of nutrients and temperature on phytoplankton have been analyzed mostly by addressing changes in average temperature, whereas recent evidence suggests an important role of temperature fluctuations. In a laboratory experiment, we grew a natural phytoplankton community under fluctuating and constant temperature regimes across 25 combinations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) supply. Temperature fluctuations decreased phytoplankton growth rate (r(max)), as predicted by nonlinear averaging along the temperature-growth relationship. r(max) increased with increasing P supply, and a significant temperature x P x N interaction reflected that the shape of the thermal reaction norm depended on nutrients. By contrast, phytoplankton carrying capacity increased with N supply and in fluctuating rather than constant temperature. Higher phytoplankton N:P ratios under constant temperature showed that temperature regimes affected cellular nutrient incorporation. Minor differences in species diversity and composition existed. Our results suggest that temperature variability interacts with nutrient supply to affect phytoplankton physiology and stoichiometry at the community level.

AB Within communities, organisms potentially self-organize through endogenous processes that create nonrandom spatial structure as they interact with one another or modify the abiotic environment. In contrast, exogenous processes such as environmental heterogeneity or variable immigration are thought to be dominant processes controlling these spatial patterns. Although both endogenous and exogenous processes likely occur, their relative importance is still largely unknown because of limited analytical tools and the lack of experimental evidence, particularly those that address exogenous sources of environmental heterogeneity. Here, we used a soil heterogeneity experiment to examine the relative effect of endogenous and exogenous processes on plant spatial structure after five years of community assembly. Soil heterogeneity was manipulated by splitting the vertical soil profile into three soil-types that were randomly assigned to 40 x 40 cm patches within 2.4 x 2.4 m plots. Homogeneous plots were created by mixing all soils before filling each patch. Thirty-four grassland species were then sown into all plots and allowed to grow for five years after which the location of all plants was mapped using a 5 x 5 cm grid. Results from point-pattern spatial analysis indicated that, even in the absence of soil heterogeneity and with initial seed arrival, spatial structure was primarily generated by endogenous processes. Although soil heterogeneity increased species aggregation at certain scales, most of the spatial structure was created by endogenous processes. These results suggest that endogenous processes may be more important than expected for generating spatial structure and can develop much faster than anticipated.

AB Understanding controls on recruitment is critical to predicting community assembly, diversity, and coexistence. Theory posits that at mean fecundity, recruitment of highly fecund small-seeded plants should be primarily microsite limited, which is indicated by a saturating recruitment function. In contrast, species that produce fewer large seeds are more likely to be seed-limited, which is characterized by a linear recruitment function. If these patterns hold in nature, seed predation that disproportionately affects larger-seeded species can limit their establishment. We tested these predictions by comparing recruitment functions among 16 co-occurring perennial forb species that vary by over two orders of magnitude in seed size. We also assessed how postdispersal seed predation by mice influenced recruitment. We added seeds at densities from zero to three times natural fecundity of each species to undisturbed plots and examined spatial variation in recruitment by conducting experiments across 10 grassland sites that varied in productivity and resource availability. Consistent across two replicated years, most species had linear recruitment functions across the range of added seed densities, indicative of seed-limited recruitment. Depending on year, the recruitment functions of only 19-37% of target species saturated near their average fecundity, and this was not associated with seed size. Recruitment was strongly inhibited by rodent seed predation for large-seeded species but not for smaller-seeded species. Proportional recruitment was more sensitive to spatial variation in recruitment conditions across sites for some small-seeded species than for large-seeded species. These results contradict the common belief that highly fecund small-seeded species suffer from microsite-limited recruitment. Rather, they imply that, at least episodically, recruitment can be strongly correlated to plant fecundity. However, proportional recruitment of small-seeded species was inhibited at productive sites to a greater extent than large-seeded species. Results also show that in a system where the dominant granivore prefers larger seeds, low-fecundity large-seeded species can suffer from even greater seed-limited recruitment than would occur in the absence of predators.

AB Forests dominated by European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) are among both the most widespread in Europe and the most intensely exploited globally. One of the largest remnants of unmanaged beech forests in Europe is the Uholka-Shyrokyi Luh forest in Transcarpathia, Ukraine, covering 8,800 ha of primeval forest. In 2000, a permanent forest plot of 10 ha has been established in the Uholka massif. All living and dead trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 60 mm were identified to species, DBH measured, stems tagged and mapped. Since then, the plot has been remeasured in 2005, 2010, and 2015. In total, 4,820 individual trees were measured with 14,116 individual measurements throughout all four inventories. In spring 2018, an Airborne Laser Scan was carried out, covering the Uholka-Shyrokyi Luh forest. This data set allows us to derive a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) of the plot area. European beech covers a share of approximate to 95% of the basal area (BA) of all living stems. While BA was relatively stable throughout all inventories (approximate to 38 m(2)/ha), the number of stems increased considerably between 2010 and 2015 from 290 to 430 stems/ha. Additionally, the proportion of beech stems decreased from 95% in 2010 to 86% in 2015. The continuity of the share of beech on BA and the decrease in number of stems can be traced back to disturbance events, which led to an increase of more light demanding species in the recruitment but did not alter the distribution of BA as these small trees contribute very little to BA. The data set allows for important insights into the development and the spatial and temporal dynamics of primeval beech forests. It can be used to quantify the demographic processes growth, mortality, and recruitment, and to study inter- and intraspecific effects on demographic rates, stand structure, and species composition.

AB Diel variability in nutrient concentrations is common but not universal in aquatic ecosystems. Theoretical models of photoautotrophic systems attribute the absence of diel uptake variation to nutrient scarcity, such that diel variability in nutrient uptake disappears as nutrients become limiting. We tested this prediction in a mesocosm experiment, by exposing benthic algal communities to a range of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus concentrations and recording the rates of uptake during both day and night. We found that higher concentrations of N produced diel variability in uptake and that the difference between the day and night total mass uptakes approximately equaled N demand for observed primary production as seen in other studies. At lower concentrations of N, uptake rates during the day and night were indistinguishable. These results are the first empirical evidence to imply that diel nitrate patterns in streams and rivers indicate a release from N limitation and offer a new way to assess nutrient limitation.

AB A key challenge to maintaining resilient landscapes is adapting to and maintaining dynamic ecological processes. In fire-dependent ecosystems, this includes identifying and defining mechanisms through which fire influences forest structure and functionality. Interpretations of tree patterns via land survey records in the Lake States have often highlighted the importance of infrequent moderate to extreme disturbance events. However, historical survey methods are limited to observing higher severity disturbances and over large landscapes, thus it is not clear if the origin, structure, and forcing factors for either patterns or processes are adequately quantified by these methods. We used dendrochronological methods to determine how fire history and stand structure, including cohort structure, tree density, and spatial patterning, are linked within Lake States mixed conifer forests in Wisconsin. We found relatively short mean fire return intervals (MFRIs) ranging from 6 to 13 yr with little variation in fire frequency among sites. Current densities of red-pine-dominated forests are 4-37 times historical (ca. 1860) densities (mean 12x) and almost entirely spatially random, whereas historically forests were spatially aggregated at stand scales. Stands also contained multiple and/or loosely defined cohort structures suggesting very different controls operating historically than currently. Heterogeneity that helped maintain ecosystem resilience in these ecosystems historically came from frequent fire disturbance processes that affected stand-scale forest resistance.

AB Mediterranean rear-edge populations of Betula, located at the southwestern Eurasian margin of the distribution range, represent unique reservoirs of genetic diversity. However, increasing densities of wild ungulates, enhanced dryness, and wildfires threaten their future persistence. A historical perspective on the past responses of these relict populations to changing herbivory, fire occurrence and climatic conditions may contribute to assessing their future responses under comparable scenarios. We have reconstructed vegetation and disturbance (grazing, fire) history in the Cabaneros National Park (central-southern Spain) using the paleoecological records of two small mires. We particularly focused on the historical range of variation in disturbance regimes, and the dynamics of rear-edge Betula populations and herbivore densities. Changes in water availability, probably related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, and land-use history have played a crucial role in vegetation shifts. Our data suggest that heathlands (mainly Erica arborea and E. scoparia) and Quercus woodlands dominated during dry phases while Sphagnum bogs and Betula stands expanded during wet periods. Betula populations survived past moderately dry periods but were unable to cope with enhanced land use, particularly increasing livestock raising since 1,100-900 cal. yr BP (850-1,050 CE), and eventually underwent local extinction. High herbivore densities not only contributed to the Betula demise but also caused the retreat of Sphagnum bogs. Ungulate densities further rose at 200-100 cal. yr BP (1750-1850 CE) associated with the historically documented intensification of land use around the Ecclesiastical Confiscation. However, herbivory reached truly unprecedented values only during the last decades, following rural depopulation and subsequent promotion of big game hunting. For the first time in temperate and Mediterranean Europe, we have used the abundances of fossil dung fungal spores to assess quantitatively that current high herbivore densities exceed the historical range of variation. In contrast, present fire activity lies within the range of variation of the last millennia, with fires (mainly human-set) mostly occurring during dry periods. Our paleodata highlight the need of controlling the densities of wild ungulates to preserve ecosystem composition and functioning. We also urge to restore Betula populations in suitable habitats where they mostly disappeared because of excessive human activities.

AB There is now strong evidence suggesting that interactions between plants and their species-specific antagonistic microbes can maintain native plant community diversity. In contrast, the decay in diversity in plant communities invaded by nonnative plant species might be caused by weakening negative feedback strengths, perhaps because of the increased relative importance of plant mutualists such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Although the vast majority of studies examining plant-soil feedbacks have been conducted in a single habitat type, there are fewer studies that have tested how the strength and direction of these feedbacks change across habitats with differing dominating plants. In a fragmented montane agricultural system in Colombia, we experimentally teased apart the relative importance of AMF and non-AMF microbes (a microbial filtrate) to the strength and direction of feedbacks in both native and nonnative plant species. We hypothesized that native tree species of forest fragments would exhibit stronger negative feedbacks with a microbial filtrate that likely contained pathogens than with AMF alone, whereas nonnative plant species, especially a highly invasive dominant grass, would exhibit overall weaker negative feedbacks or even positive feedbacks regardless of the microbial type. We reciprocally inoculated each of 10 plant species separately with either the AMF community or the microbial filtrate originating from their own conspecifics, or with the AMF or microbial filtrate originating from each of the other nine heterospecific plant species. Overall, we found that the strength of negative feedback mediated by the filtrate was much stronger than feedbacks mediated by AMF. Surprisingly, we found that the two nonnative species, Urochloa brizantha and Coffea arabica, experienced stronger negative feedbacks with microbial filtrate than did the native forest tree species, suggesting that species-specific antagonistic microbes accumulate when a single host species dominates, as is the case in agricultural habitats. However, negative feedback between forest trees and agricultural species suggests that soil community dynamics may contribute to the re-establishment of native species into abandoned agricultural lands. Furthermore, our finding of no negative feedbacks among trees in forest fragments may be due to a loss in diversity of those microbes that drive diversity-maintaining processes in intact tropical forests.

AB Variation in life-history strategies can affect metapopulation dynamics and consequently the composition and diversity of communities. However, data sets that allow for the full range of species turnover from colonization to extinction over relevant time periods are limited. The late Quaternary record provides unique opportunities to explore the traits that may have influenced interspecific variation in responses to past climate warming, in particular the rate at which species colonized newly suitable habitat or went locally extinct from degrading habitat. We controlled for differences in species climate niches in order to predict expected colonization and extinction sequences recorded in packrat middens from 15 localities in the Mohave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan deserts of North America. After accounting for temperature niche differences, we tested the hypotheses that dispersal syndrome (none, wind, vertebrate), growth form (herb, shrub, tree) and seed mass mediated variation in postglacial colonization lags among species, whereas clonality (clonal, non-clonal), growth form, and seed mass affected extinction lags. Growth form and dispersal syndrome interactively affected colonization lags, where herbaceous species lacking long-distance dispersal mechanisms exhibited lags that exceeded those of woody, wind or vertebrate-dispersed species by an average of 2,000-5,000 yr. Growth form and seed mass interactively affected extinction lags, with very small-seeded shrubs persisting for 4,000-8,000 yr longer than other functional groups. Taller, vertebrate-dispersed plants have been shown in other studies to disperse farther than shorter plants without specialized dispersal mechanisms. We found that variation along this axis of dispersal syndromes resulted in dramatic differences in colonization rates in response to past climate change. Very small seeded shrubs may have a unique combination of long vegetative and seed bank lifetimes that may allow them to persist for long periods despite declines in habitat condition. This study indicates that readily measurable traits may help predict which species will be more or less sensitive to future climate change, and inform interventions that can stabilize and promote at-risk populations.

AB Changes in the frequency, duration, and intensity of rainfall events are among the abiotic effects predicted under anthropogenic global warming. Heavy downpours may profoundly affect the development and survival of small organisms such as insects. Here, we examined direct (physically on the insects) and indirect (plant-mediated) effects of simulated downpours on the performance of caterpillars of two lepidopteran herbivores (Plutella xylostella and Pieris brassicae) feeding on black mustard (Brassica nigra) plants. Host plants were exposed to different rainfall regimes both before and while caterpillars were feeding on the plants in an attempt to separate direct and indirect (plant-mediated) effects of rainfall on insect survival and development. In two independent experiments, downpours were simulated as a single long (20 min) or as three short (5 min) daily events. Downpours had a strong negative direct effect on the survival of P. xylostella, but not on that of P. brassicae. Direct effects of downpours consistently increased development time of both herbivore species, whereas effects on body mass depended on herbivore species and downpour frequency. Caterpillar disturbance by rain and recorded microclimatic cooling by 5 degrees C may explain extended immature development. Indirect, plant-mediated effects of downpours on the herbivores were generally small, despite the fact that sugar concentrations were reduced and herbivore induction of secondary metabolites (glucosinolates) was enhanced in plants exposed to rain. Changes in the frequency of precipitation events due to climate change may impact the survival and development of insect herbivores differentially. Broader effects of downpours on insects and other arthropods up the food chain could seriously impair and disrupt trophic interactions, ultimately destabilizing communities.

AB The study of rodent population cycles has greatly contributed, both theoretically and empirically, to our understanding of the circumstances under which predator-prey interactions destabilize populations. According to the specialist predator hypothesis, reciprocal interactions between voles and small predators that specialize on voles, such as weasels, can cause multiannual cycles. A fundamental feature of classical weasel-vole models is a long time-lag in the numerical response of the predator to variations in prey abundance: weasel abundance increases with that of voles and peaks approximately 1 yr later. We investigated the numerical response of the common weasel (Mustela nivalis) to fluctuating abundances of common voles (Microtus arvalis) in recently colonized agrosteppes of Castilla-y-Leon, northwestern Spain, at the southern limit of the species' range. Populations of both weasels and voles exhibited multiannual cycles with a 3-yr period. Weasels responded quickly and numerically to changes in common-vole abundance, with a time lag between prey and weasel abundance that did not exceed 4 months and occurred during the breeding season, reflecting the quick conversion of prey into predator offspring and/or immigration to sites with high vole populations. We found no evidence of a sustained, high weasel abundance following vole abundance peaks. Weasel population growth rates showed spatial synchrony across study sites approximately 60 km apart. Weasel dynamics were more synchronized with that of common voles than with other prey species (mice or shrews). However, asynchrony within, as well as among sites, in the abundance of voles and alternative prey suggests that weasel mobility could allow them to avoid starvation during low-vole phases, precluding the emergence of prolonged time lag in the numerical response to voles. Our observations are inconsistent with the specialist predator hypothesis as currently formulated, and suggest that weasels might follow rather than cause the vole cycles in northwestern Spain. The reliance of a specialized predator on a functional group of prey such as small rodents does not necessarily lead to a long delay in the numerical response by the predator, depending on the spatial and interspecific synchrony in prey dynamics.

AB The generality of ecological patterns depends inextricably on the scale at which they are examined. We investigated patterns of crab distribution and the relationship between crabs and vegetation in salt marshes at multiple scales. By using consistent monitoring protocols across 15 U.S. National Estuarine Research Reserves, we were able to synthesize patterns from the scale of quadrats to the entire marsh landscape to regional and national scales. Some generalities emerged across marshes from our overall models, and these are useful for informing broad coastal management policy. We found that crab burrow distribution within a marsh could be predicted by marsh elevation, distance to creek and soil compressibility. While these physical factors also affected marsh vegetation cover, we did not find a strong or consistent overall effect of crabs at a broad scale in our multivariate model, though regressions conducted separately for each site revealed that crab burrows were negatively correlated with vegetation cover at 4 out of 15 sites. This contrasts with recent smaller-scale studies and meta-analyses synthesizing such studies that detected strong negative effects of crabs on marshes, likely because we sampled across the entire marsh landscape, while targeted studies are typically limited to low-lying areas near creeks, where crab burrow densities are highest. Our results suggest that sea-level rise generally poses a bigger threat to marshes than crabs, but there will likely be interactions between these physical and biological factors. Beyond these generalities across marshes, we detected some regional differences in crab community composition, richness, and abundance. However, we found striking differences among sites within regions, and within sites, in terms of crab abundance and relationships to marsh integrity. Although generalities are broadly useful, our findings indicate that local managers cannot rely on data from other nearby systems, but rather need local information for developing salt marsh management strategies.

AB Pairwise interactions between species have both direct and indirect consequences that reverberate throughout the whole ecosystem. In particular, interaction effects may propagate in a spatial dimension, to localities connected by organismal movement. Here we study the propagation of interaction effects with a spatially explicit metacommunity model, where local sites are connected by dispersal, foraging, or by both types of movement. We show that indirect pairwise effects are, in most cases, of the same sign as direct effects if localities are connected by dispersing species. However, if foraging is prevalent, this correspondence is broken, and indirect effects between species often have a different sign than direct effects. This highlights the importance of indirect interactions across space and their inherent unpredictability in complex settings with species foraging across local patches. Further, the effect of a species over another in a local patch does not necessarily correspond to its effect at the metacommunity scale; this correspondence is again mediated by the type of movement across localities. Every species, despite their trophic position or spatial range, displays a non-zero net effect over every other species in our model metacommunities. Thus we show that local dynamics and local interactions between species can trigger indirect effects all across the set of connected patches, and these effects have a distinct signature depending on whether the prevalent connection between patches is via dispersal or via foraging. However, the magnitude of this effect between any two species strongly decays with the distance between them. These theoretical results strengthen the importance of considering indirect effects across species at both the community and metacommunity levels, highlight the differences between types of movement across locations, and thus open novel avenues for the study of interaction effects in spatially explicit settings.

TI PlantNE: a global database of plant biomass from nitrogen-addition
   experiments
SO ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article; Data Paper
DE biomass; global; growth; nitrogen addition; plant; species
AB The growth of terrestrial plants and the production of terrestrial ecosystems are highly dependent on the availability of nitrogen (N). During the past decades, the rate of global atmospheric N deposition has shown an increasing trend, greatly relieving N limitation on terrestrial plant growth. Thus, whether and how plant biomass will respond to increasing N deposition in the future is particularly important with regard to the function of terrestrial ecosystems. The N-addition experiment is a major approach to study the ecological responses of plant species occurring in natural terrestrial ecosystems under N enrichment. In recent decades, many N-addition experiments have been conducted across various plant functional types and terrestrial ecosystems, but their data on plant biomass have yet to be synthesized into a single database. Here, we present an open-access database of measured plant biomass in N-addition experiments (PlantNE) collected from available publications in Web of Science. The reported mean, standard deviation, and sample size of plant biomass in both control and treatment plots were collected in each publication. As a result, the PlantNE database records 519 plant species from 4,599 observations in 348 published studies. It covers a wide geographical range (54.75 degrees S-69.66 degrees N; 157.80 degrees W-175.30 degrees E) and a broad natural climate zone (-10 degrees C to 27.6 degrees C; 94-7,000 mm) over the past three decades (1982-2018). Information related to the experimental site (i.e., latitude, longitude, country, ecosystem, experimental condition, temperature, and precipitation), biotic factors (i.e., species, plant category, plant age, planting pattern, and plant part), and N treatment (i.e., N dose, treatment interval and duration, and N addition with other treatments) is included in this database. We expect that the PlantNE database can contribute to the understanding of ecosystem productivity and biodiversity under increasing atmospheric N deposition and provide empirical data for model studies. There are no copyright restrictions; personal or noncommercial use of this database by researchers and teachers is encouraged. Researchers are requested to cite this paper if using all or part of the database. As we intend to keep this database up to date on GitHub (see Metadata S1 for details) and Zenodo (), researchers are encouraged to inform us of the applications of this database.

AB Through its behavior, an organism intentionally or unintentionally produces information. Use of this "social information" by surrounding conspecifics or heterospecifics is a ubiquitous phenomenon that can drive strong correlations in fitness-associated behaviors, such as predator avoidance, enhancing survival within and among competing species. By eliciting indirect positive interactions between competing individuals or species, social information might alter overall competitive outcomes. To test this potential, we present new theory that quantifies the effect of social information, modeled as predator avoidance signals/cues, on the outcomes from intraspecific and interspecific competition. Our analytical and numerical results reveal that social information can rescue populations from extinction and can shift the long-term outcome of competitive interactions from mutual exclusion to coexistence, or vice versa, depending on the relative strengths of intraspecific and interspecific social information and competition. Our findings highlight the importance of social information in determining ecological outcomes.

AB The functional trait approach proposes that relating traits of organisms within a community to variation in abiotic and biotic characteristics of their environment will provide insight on the mechanisms of community assembly. As traits at a given trophic level might act as filters for the selection of traits at another trophic level, we hypothesized that traits of consumers and of their resources covary in space. We evaluated complementary predictions about top-down (negative) and bottom-up (positive) trait covariation in a detrital food web. Additionally, we tested whether positive trait covariation was better explained by the Resource Concentration Hypothesis (i.e., most commonly represented trait values attract abundant consumers) or the Resource Specialization Hypothesis (i.e., resource diversity increases niche availability for the consumers). Macroarthopods were collected with pitfall traps over two summers in three forested sites of southern Quebec in 110 plots that varied in tree species composition. Six feeding traits of consumers (detritivores and predators) and six palatability traits of their resources (leaf litter and prey) were matched to assess spatial covariation. Trait matches included consumer biting force/resource toughness, detritivore mandibular gape/leaf thickness, predator/prey body size ratio, etc. Our results demonstrate for the first time a covariation between feeding traits of detritivores and palatability traits of leaf litter (31-34%), and between feeding traits of litter-dwelling predators and palatability traits of potential prey (38-44%). The observed positive covariation supports both the Resource Concentration Hypothesis and Resource Specialization Hypothesis. Spatial covariation of consumer and resource traits provides a new tool to partially predict the structure of the detrital food web. Nonetheless, top-down regulation remains difficult to confirm. Further research on top-down processes will be undoubtedly necessary to refine our capacity to interpret the effect of biotic interactions on co-distribution.

AB Climate change-induced phenological shifts are ubiquitous and have the potential to disrupt natural communities by changing the timing of species interactions. Shifts in first and/or mean phenological date are well documented, but recent studies indicate that shifts in synchrony (individual variation around these metrics) can be just as common. However, we know little about how both types of phenological shifts interact to affect species interactions and communities. Here, we experimentally manipulated the hatching phenologies of two competing species of larval amphibians to address this conceptual gap. Specifically, we manipulated the relative mean hatching time (early, same, or late relative to competitor) and population synchrony (high, medium, or low levels of variation around the mean) in a full 3 x 3 factorial design to measure independent and interactive effects of phenological mean and population phenological synchrony on competitive outcomes. Our results indicate that phenological synchrony within a population strongly influences intraspecific competition by changing the density of individuals and relative strength of early- vs. late-arriving individuals. Individuals from high-synchrony populations competed symmetrically, whereas individuals from low-synchrony populations competed asymmetrically. At the community scale, shifts in population phenological synchrony interact with shifts in phenological mean to affect key demographic rates (survival, biomass export, per capita mass, and emergence timing) strongly. Furthermore, changes in mean timing of species interactions altered phenological synchrony within a population at the next life stage, and phenological synchrony at one life stage altered the mean timing of the next life stage. Thus, shifts in phenological synchrony within populations cannot only alter species interactions, but species interactions in turn can also drive shifts in phenology.

AB Biotic interactions play a critical role in mediating community responses to temporal environmental variation, but the importance of these effects relative to the direct effects of environmental change remains poorly understood, particularly in diverse forest communities. Here we combine a neighborhood modeling approach with insights from coexistence theory to assess the effects of temporal variation in species interactions and environmental conditions (e.g., precipitation, temperature, and understory light availability) on seedling survival over nine census years in a subtropical forest. We find significant temporal shifts in the magnitude of neighborhood effects on both community-wide and species-level seedling survival (statistically significant random effects of neighborhood x year and neighborhood x species x year interactions). These results are consistent with the idea that environmental change will play a fundamental role on forest regeneration dynamics by altering biotic interactions at the neighborhood scale. Moreover, differences among species in response to neighbors over time contribute to a pattern of temporal decoupling of seedling survival between species, which can help to promote diversity in certain contexts. In separate analyses of multiple regression on distance matrices (MRM), altered interactions with neighbors are much stronger predictors of asynchronous seedling survival among species than the pure effects of climate and plant functional traits, explaining twice as much variation (43.9% vs. 22.2%). In sum, these results reveal that divergent species responses to interannual environmental variability detected are driven primarily by indirect effects mediated by changing biotic environments. This highlights the importance of including indirect effects from local biotic (neighborhood) interactions in forecasts of forest community responses to global change.

AB Population responses to environmental change depend on both the ecological interactions between species and the evolutionary responses of all species. In this study, we explore how evolution in prey, predators, or both species affect the responses of predator populations to a sustained increase in mortality. We use an eco-evolutionary predator-prey model to explore how evolution alters the predator extinction threshold (defined as the minimum mortality rate that prevents population growth at low predator densities) and predator hydra effects (increased predator abundance in response to increased mortality). Our analysis identifies how evolutionary responses of prey and predators individually affect the predator extinction threshold and hydra effects, and how those effects are altered by interactions between the evolutionary responses. Based on our theoretical results, we predict that it is common in natural systems for evolutionary responses in one or both species to allow predators to persist at higher mortality rates than would be possible in the absence of evolution (i.e., evolution increases the predator mortality extinction threshold). We also predict that evolution-driven hydra effects occur in a minority of natural systems, but are not rare. We revisited published eco-evolutionary models and found that evolution causes hydra effects and increases the predator extinction threshold in many studies, but those effects have been overlooked. We discuss the implications of these results for species conservation, predicting population responses to environmental change, and the possibility of evolutionary rescue.

AB Occurrence patterns of many sessile species in dynamic landscapes are not in equilibrium due to their slow rates of metapopulation colonization and extinction. Colonization-extinction data enable the estimation of colonization rates for such species, but collecting the necessary data may require long waiting times between sampling years. Methods for estimating colonization rates of nonequilibrium metapopulations from single occurrence-pattern data have so far relied on additional data on patch ages and on past patch connectivities. We present an approach where metapopulation colonization rates are estimated from occurrence-pattern data and from disturbance history data that inform of past patch dynamics and that can be collected together with occurrence-pattern data. We estimated parameter values regulating patch and metapopulation dynamics by simulating patch network and metapopulation histories that result in present-like patch network configurations and metapopulation occurrence patterns. We tested our approach using occurrence-pattern data of the epiphytic lichen Lobaria pulmonaria in Fennoscandian forests, and fire-scar data that inform of the 400-yr history of fires and host tree dynamics in the same landscapes. The estimated model parameters were similar to estimates obtained using colonization-extinction data. The projected L. pulmonaria occupancy into the future also agreed with the respective projections that were made using the model estimated from colonization-extinction data. Our approach accelerates the estimation of metapopulation colonization rates for sessile species that are not in metapopulation equilibrium with the current landscape structure.

AB Aggregations are common in ecological systems at a range of scales and may be driven by exogenous constraints such as environmental heterogeneity and resource availability or by "self-organizing" interactions among individuals. One mechanism leading to self-organized animal aggregations is captured by Hamilton's "selfish herd" hypothesis, which suggests that aggregations may be driven by an individual's effort to minimize their risk of predation by surrounding themselves with conspecifics. We demonstrate that aggregations observed in Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colonies are a convolution of both self-organized dynamics and external forcing arising from landscape terrain. In fluid, highly mobile aggregations, individuals are constantly moving in response to changing environmental conditions, the locations of predators, or the movements of conspecifics. However, when the ability to rearrange is limited and spatial reconfiguration occurs on slower time scales than changes in population size, systems may become trapped in suboptimal arrangements. We use simulated annealing to demonstrate that Adelie Penguin colonies are frozen in suboptimal spatial arrangements, and employ an individual-based modeling approach to demonstrate that this suboptimal spatial configuration is driven by a convolution of nest site fidelity and stochastic events at the level of individual nests. The resulting spatial dynamics are responsible for a hysteretic response to long-term changes in abundance. We find that declining abundance leads to fragmentation even in a homogeneous environment, which has population-level consequences for reproductive success because predation is biased towards colony edges. Strong edge effects from heterogeneous predation coupled with fragmentation in response to population declines create a positive feedback cycle that can accelerate population decline. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of complex spatial structuring in penguin colonies, provides a link between current spatial patterning and past dynamics, and suggests the possibility of critical collapse in seabird populations.

AB Incidence, or compositional, matrices are generated for a broad range of research applications in biology. Zeta diversity provides a common currency and conceptual framework that links incidence-based metrics with multiple patterns of interest in biology, ecology, and biodiversity science. It quantifies the variation in species (or OTU) composition of multiple assemblages (or cases) in space or time, to capture the contribution of the full suite of narrow, intermediate, and wide-ranging species to biotic heterogeneity. Here we provide a conceptual framework for the application and interpretation of patterns of continuous change in compositional diversity using zeta diversity. This includes consideration of the survey design context, and the multiple ways in which zeta diversity decline and decay can be used to examine and test turnover in the identity of elements across space and time. We introduce the zeta ratio-based retention rate curve to quantify rates of compositional change. We illustrate these applications using 11 empirical data sets from a broad range of taxa, scales, and levels of biological organization-from DNA molecules and microbes to communities and interaction networks-including one of the original data sets used to express compositional change and distance decay in ecology. We show (1) how different sample selection schemes used during the calculation of compositional change are appropriate for different data types and questions, (2) how higher orders of zeta may in some cases better detect shifts and transitions, and (3) the relative roles of rare vs. common species in driving patterns of compositional change. By exploring the application of zeta diversity decline and decay, including the retention rate, across this broad range of contexts, we demonstrate its application for understanding continuous turnover in biological systems.

AB In drylands, the coexistence of grasses and woody plants has been attributed to soil-water resource partitioning. Soil texture and precipitation seasonality can influence the amount and distribution of water in the soil, and their interaction may play an important role in determining the relative importance of grasses and woody plants. We investigated the influence of this interaction on plant functional types across a broad range of precipitation regimes and soil textures in western North America by analyzing plant-cover data collected at 2,084 plots that included the widespread shrub big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.). We characterized how the significance of the inverse-texture effect varies across soil conditions by quantifying relationships between precipitation and foliar cover on finer- vs. coarser-textured soils across a range of potential texture divisions represented by sand content. We found evidence of the inverse-texture effect for every plant functional type (except for cheatgrass) that we examined with at least one component of precipitation (annual, warm, or cold season), and provide the first evidence for this effect in locations with cold-season-dominated precipitation regimes. The texture and precipitation combinations that exhibited the inverse-texture effect varied with plant functional type, presumably because of effects of soil texture on water availability at different soil depths with season. Furthermore, we found an inverse-texture effect that was remarkably similar for shrub cover with cold-season precipitation and grass cover with warm-season precipitation. These results provide new insight into how the inverse-texture effect interacts with precipitation seasonality to influence plant functional type composition in drylands, and further suggest that quantifying the soil-texture division at which the inverse-texture effect is relevant under a given set of environmental conditions may provide support for the effect across dryland plant communities.

AB Lianas are more abundant in seasonal forests than in wetter forests and are thought to perform better than trees when light is abundant and water is limited. We tested the hypothesis that lianas perform better than trees during seasonal drought using a common garden experiment with 12 taxonomically diverse species (six liana and six tree species) in 12 replicated plots. We irrigated six of the plots during the dry season for four years, while the remaining six control plots received only ambient rainfall. In year 5, we measured stem diameters for all individuals and harvested above- and belowground biomass for a subset of individuals to quantify absolute growth and biomass allocation to roots, stems, and leaves, as well as total root length and maximum rooting depth. We also measured rate of photosynthesis, intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE), pre-dawn and midday water potential, and a set of functional and hydraulic traits. During the peak of the dry season, lianas in control plots had 54% higher predawn leaf water potentials (psi(PD)), and 45% higher photosynthetic rates than trees in control plots. By contrast, during the peak of the wet season, these physiological differences between lianas and trees become less pronounced and, in some cases, even disappeared. Trees had higher specific leaf area (SLA) than lianas; however, no other functional trait differed between growth forms. Trees responded to the irrigation treatment with 15% larger diameters and 119% greater biomass than trees in control plots. Liana growth, however, did not respond to irrigation; liana diameter and biomass were similar in control and irrigation plots, suggesting that lianas were far less limited by soil moisture than were trees. Contrary to previous hypotheses, lianas did not have deeper roots than trees; however, lianas had longer roots per stem diameter than did trees. Our results support the hypothesis that lianas perform better and experience less physiological stress than trees during seasonal drought, suggesting clear differences between growth forms in response to altered rainfall regimes. Ultimately, better dry-season performance may explain why liana abundance peaks in seasonal forests compared to trees, which peak in abundance in less seasonal, wetter forests.

AB Elucidating how organismal survival depends on the environment is a core component of ecological and evolutionary research. To reconcile high-frequency covariates with lower-frequency demographic censuses, many statistical tools involve aggregating environmental conditions over long periods, potentially obscuring the importance of fluctuating conditions in driving mortality. Here, we introduce a flexible model designed to infer how survival probabilities depend on changing environmental covariates. Specifically, the model (1) quantifies effects of environmental covariates at a higher frequency than the census intervals, and (2) allows partitioning of environmental drivers of individual survival into acute (short-term) and chronic (accumulated) effects. By applying our method to a long-term observational data set of eight annual plant species, we show we can accurately infer daily survival probabilities as temperature and moisture levels change. Next, we show that a species' water use efficiency, known to mediate annual plant population dynamics, is positively correlated with the importance of "chronic stress" inferred by the model. This suggests that model parameters can reflect underlying physiological mechanisms. This method is also applicable to other binary responses (hatching, phenology) or systems (insects, nestlings). Once known, environmental sensitivities can be used for ecological forecasting even when the frequency or variability of environments are changing.

AB Elucidating the variation of allocation pattern of ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP) and its underlying mechanisms is critically important for understanding the changes of aboveground and belowground ecosystem functions. Under optimal partitioning theory, plants should allocate more NPP to the organ that acquires the most limiting resource, and this expectation has been widely used to explain and predict NPP allocation under changing precipitation. However, confirmatory evidence for this theory has mostly come from observed spatial variation in the relationship between precipitation and NPP allocation across ecosystems, rather than directly from the influences of changing precipitation on NPP allocation within systems. We performed a 6-yr five-level precipitation manipulation experiment in a semiarid steppe to test whether changes in NPP allocation can be explained by the optimal partitioning theory, and how water requirement of plant community is maintained if NPP allocation is unaltered. The 30 precipitation levels (5 levels x 6 yr) were divided into dry, nominal, and wet precipitation ranges, relative to historical precipitation variation over the past six decades. We found that NPP in both aboveground (ANPP) and belowground (BNPP) increased nonlinearly as precipitation increased, while the allocation of NPP to BNPP (f(BNPP)) showed a concave quadratic relationship with precipitation. The declined f(BNPP) as precipitation increased in the dry range supported the optimal partitioning theory. However, in the nominal range, NPP allocation was not influenced by the changed precipitation; instead, BNPP was distributed more in the surface soil horizon (0-10 cm) as precipitation increased, and conversely more in the deeper soil layers (10-30 cm) as precipitation decreased. This response in root foraging appears to be a strategy to satisfy plant water requirements and partially explains the stable NPP allocation patterns. Overall, our results suggest that plants can adjust their vertical BNPP distribution in response to drought stress, and that only under extreme drought does the optimal partitioning theory strictly apply, highlighting the context dependency of the adaption and growth of plants under changing precipitation.

AB Microclimatic data are required for many problems in pure and applied ecology. This data includes aboveground convective and radiative conditions as well as soil temperature and moisture. In cold regions, the connection between above- and belowground microclimates via snow cover is also critically important. Here I describe a data set of hourly microclimates for the continental United States, simulated from the years 1979 to 2017 across a grid of 2,287 locations approximately 60 km apart. The data were generated with the NicheMapR microclimate model, driven by 0.04 degrees gridded daily meteorological forcing data (air temperature, wind speed, humidity, solar radiation, air pressure, and rainfall). The aboveground microclimate variables include horizontal plane solar radiation, solar zenith angle, sky temperature (from which downwelling longwave radiation can be computed), air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed at 1 and 200 cm height, and snow depth. The belowground variables include soil temperature, pore humidity, soil moisture, and soil water potential for 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 100, and 200 cm belowground. The computations are for four shade levels (0%, 50%, 75%, and 90%). The predictions are validated against detailed soil temperature, soil moisture, and snow observations and show enhanced performance over existing microclimatic data for the United States. The data set can be used for a wide variety of applications, including the computation of heat and water budgets of organisms, the potential for vegetation growth, and the computation of stress and growth indices. The use of daily forcing data also allows assessments of the consequences of extreme events including heat waves and drought. Example applications are provided for computing plant growth potential, lizard egg development and body temperature, and mammalian energy and water requirements.

AB Soil-microbe interactions have the potential to mediate the ability of tree populations to persist in their current location or establish in new areas. Immigration of microbial taxa from drier conditions may promote seedling tolerance to drying climates. In a greenhouse experiment, we determined seedling performance of Ostrya virginiana and Betula nigra seedlings after experimentally swapping sterilized soils and local and foreign microbial inocula from nine sites over a gradient of precipitation and soil types, in well-watered and water reduced conditions. Swapping microbial inocula relative to abiotic soils along latitudinal, but not longitudinal, gradients resulted in reduced seedling biomass. Additionally, growth in water reduced conditions was maximized when pots were inoculated with microbes from drier sites. These results suggest that extirpation of local microbial taxa, and/or immigration of novel microbial taxa to a site may be detrimental to plant growth due to mismatches between microbes and soil conditions. However, immigration of drought adapted microbial taxa may provide additional drought tolerance to plant populations facing drying conditions. This work contributes to the understanding of how microbial interactions may potentially exacerbate or mitigate challenges to plant populations caused by climate change.

AB Parasites can shape the structure and function of ecosystems by influencing both the density and traits of their hosts. Such changes in ecosystems are particularly likely when the host is a predator that mediates the dynamics of trophic cascades. Here, we experimentally tested how parasite load of a small predatory fish, the threespine stickleback, can affect the occurrence and strength of trophic cascades and ecosystem functioning. In a factorial mesocosm experiment, we manipulated the density of stickleback (low vs. high), and the level of parasite load (natural vs. reduced). In addition, we used two stickleback populations from different lineages: an eastern European lineage with a more pelagic phenotype (Lake Constance) and a western European lineage with a more benthic phenotype (Lake Geneva). We found that stickleback caused trophic cascades in the pelagic but not the benthic food chain. Evidence for pelagic trophic cascades was stronger in treatments where parasite load of stickleback was reduced with an antihelmintic medication, and where fish originated from Lake Constance (i.e., the more pelagic lineage). A structural equation model revealed that differences in stickleback lineage and parasite load were most likely to impact trophic cascades via changes in the composition, rather than overall biomass, of zooplankton communities. Overall, our results provide experimental evidence that parasites of predators can influence the cascading effects of fish on lower trophic levels with consequences on ecosystem functioning.

AB When prey is patchily distributed, predators are expected to spend more time searching for food in proximity of recent prey captures before searching in other areas. This behavior, known as area-restricted search, results in predators remaining localized in areas where prey had been detected previously because of the higher probability of encountering additional prey. However, few studies have tested these predictions on marine species because of the difficulties of observing feeding behavior. In this study, we utilized passive acoustic detections of echolocating dolphins to identify foraging behavior. C-PODs (click train detectors) were deployed for two years with an acoustic recorder attached to the same mooring during the second year. The time series of feeding buzzes, indicative of foraging behavior, revealed that both bottlenose (Tursiops truncatus) and common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) were more likely to stay in the area longer when foraging activity was high at the beginning of the encounter. The probability of foraging was also higher following previous foraging activity. This suggests that dolphins were feeding on spatially patchy prey and previous foraging experience influenced their movement behavior. This is consistent with the predictions of area-restricted search behavior, a nonrandom foraging strategy.

AB Temporal fluctuations in plant species coexistence are key to understanding ecosystem state transitions and long-term maintenance of species diversity. Although plant microbiomes can alter plant competition in short-term experiments, their relevance to natural temporal patterns in plant communities is unresolved. In a semiarid grassland, the frequency and magnitude of change in plant species composition through time varied from relatively static to highly dynamic among patches across the landscape. We field tested whether these alternative successional trajectories correlated with alternative plant-soil interactions. In temporally stable patches, we found negative plant-soil feedbacks, where plants grew worse with conspecific than heterospecific soil biota-a mechanism that maintains stability in mathematical models. In contrast, feedbacks in temporally dynamic patches were neutral to positive. Importantly, the magnitude of feedbacks depended on plant frequency, enabling plant species to increase in cover when rare, which theory predicts will promote long-term, stable coexistence. Although our study does not determine the direction of causality, our results reveal a novel link between plant-microbe interactions and temporal stability of plant species coexistence and help to explain 20+ yr of plant abundance dynamics at the patch-to-landscape scales.

AB Global ecosystem models suggest that bedrock nitrogen (N) weathering contributes 10-20% of total N inputs to the natural terrestrial biosphere and >38% of ecosystem N supplies in temperate forests specifically. Yet, the role of rock N weathering in shaping ecological processes and biogeochemical fluxes is largely unknown. Here, we show that temperate forest ecosystems underlain by N-rich bedrock exhibit higher free-living N fixation rates than similar forests residing on N-poor parent materials, across sites experiencing a range of climate and tectonic regimes. This seemingly counterintuitive result can be explained by increased accumulation of soil C and P in high bedrock N sites, resulting in increased energy inputs and nutrient supplies to N fixing microorganisms. Our findings advance a novel ecosystem biogeochemical framework that recognizes long-term plant-soil-microbe feedbacks in shaping biogeochemical processes, with potentially widespread implications given the global distribution of bedrock N across Earth's terrestrial biomes.

AB Demographic rates in plants are usually assumed to be more stage or size dependent than age dependent, and aging is therefore not considered in demographic models. However, little is known about the effect of age on demographic rates, as there still are few studies based on long-term individual-based plant population data that consider both individual age and size. In addition, little is known about how aging of individuals may affect population dynamics. We present analyses of demographic data for three populations of Fumana procumbens collected 1985-2013, on individuals with known year of germination. We modeled age- and size-dependence of the vital rates of survival, growth, fruiting probability, and fruit number using thin plate spline regressions, and constructed an age x size integral projection model (IPM) to project population-level effects of aging. We found strong correlations between age and vital rates in solely age-based vital rate models, where vital rates initially increased with age, after which they stabilized and, in some cases, eventually declined. In survival models with both age and size, the effects of age were statistically significant, whereas size effects were insignificant at two of the sites. For other vital rates, most of the effect of age could be explained by size alone. In addition, including the age effects on survival in the IPM led to lower population growth rates compared to predictions of a size-only IPM. These results illustrate that demographic senescence does occur in perennial plants, which has only been demonstrated clearly in a few recent detailed studies. Moreover, we show that population projections may be overly optimistic if they do not consider plant age. We conclude that the possibility of demographic senescence should be considered in demographic population models, such as those used in viability analyses of threatened species.

AB Species interact with the physical world in complex ways, and life-history strategies could cause species to differ in how they experience the connectedness of the same landscape. As a consequence, dispersal limitation might be present but not captured by distance-based measures of connectivity. To test these ideas, we surveyed plant communities that live on discrete patches of serpentine habitat embedded within an invaded nonserpentine habitat matrix. Species in these communities differ in dispersal mode (gravity, animal, or wind); thus we used satellite imagery to quantify landscape features that might differentially influence connectivity for some dispersal- mode groups over others (surface streams, animal paths). Our data yielded two key insights: first, dispersal limitation appeared to be absent using a conventional distance-based measure of connectivity, but emerged after considering forms of landscape connectivity relevant to each dispersal mode. Second, the landscape variables that emerged as most important to each dispersal mode were generally consistent with our predictions based on species' putative dispersal vectors, but also included unexpected interactive effects. For example, the richness of animal-dispersed species was positively associated with animal connectivity when patches were close in space, but when patches were isolated, animals had a strong negative effect. This finding alludes to the reduced ability of animals to disperse seeds between suitable patches in invaded landscapes because of increased inter-patch distances. Real landscapes include complex spatial flows of energy and matter, which, as our work demonstrates, sets up ecological opportunity for organisms to differ in how they disperse in a common landscape.

AB Understanding the relative roles of species interactions and environmental factors in structuring communities has historically focused on local scales where manipulative experiments are possible. However, recent interest in predicting the effects of climate change and species invasions has spurred increasing attention to processes occurring at larger spatial and temporal scales. The "meta-ecosystem" approach is an ideal framework for integrating processes operating at multiple scales as it explicitly considers the influence of local biotic interactions and regional flows of energy, materials, and organisms on community structure. Using a comparative-experimental design, we asked (1) what is the relative importance of local biotic interactions and oceanic processes in determining rocky intertidal community structure in the low zone within the Northern California Current System, and (2) what factors are most important in regulating this structure and why? We focused on functional group interactions between macrophytes and sessile invertebrates and their consumers (grazers, predators), how these varied across spatial scales, and with ocean-driven conditions (upwelling, temperature) and ecological subsidies (nutrients, phytoplankton, sessile invertebrate recruits). Experiments were conducted at 13 sites divided across four capes in Oregon and northern California. Results showed that biotic interactions were variable in space and time but overall, sessile invertebrates had no effect on macrophytes while macrophytes had weakly negative effects on sessile invertebrates. Consumers, particularly predators, also had weakly negative effects on both functional groups. Overall, we found that 40-49% of the variance in community structure at the local scale was explained by external factors (e.g., spatial scale, time, upwelling, temperature, ecological subsidies) vs. 19-39% explained by functional group interactions. When individual functional group interaction strengths were used, only 2-3% of the variation was explained by any one functional group while 28-54% of the variation was explained by external factors. We conclude that community structure in the low intertidal zone is driven primarily by external factors at the regional scale with local biotic interactions playing a secondary role.

AB Many plants engage in protective mutualisms, offering resources such as extrafloral nectar and shelters to predatory arthropods in exchange for protection against herbivores. Recent work indicates that sticky plants catch small insects and provide this carrion to predators who defend the plants against herbivores. In this study, we investigated whether wild tobacco, Nicotiana attenuata, fits this sticky plant defense syndrome that has been described for other sticky plants. We developed a bioassay for stickiness involving the number of flies that adhered to flowers, the stickiest tissues. In surveys conducted over three field seasons at four sites, we found that the number of carrion that adhered to a plant was positively correlated with the number of predators that we observed foraging over its surfaces. The number of predators was positively correlated with the number of seed capsules that the plant produced, a measure of lifetime female reproductive success. Structural equation modeling indicated strong support for the causal path linking carrion numbers to predator numbers to capsule production. We investigated whether stickiness was an inducible trait and examined two potential cues. We found that experimental clipping of rosette leaves induced greater stickiness, although clipping of neighboring sagebrush leaves did not. Damage to leaf tissue is likely to be a more reliable predictor of risk than is damage to a neighboring plant. The sticky plant defense syndrome is a widespread protective mutualism; its strength and ecological relevance can adjust as risk of herbivory changes.

AB Climate change is shifting altitudinal species ranges, with potential to disrupt species interactions. Altitudinal gradient studies and warming experiments can both increase understanding of climate effects on species interactions, but few studies have used both together to improve predictions. We examined whether plant-fungal symbioses responded similarly to altitude and 23 yr of experimental warming. Root- and leaf-associated fungi, which can mediate plants' climate sensitivity, responded divergently to elevation vs. warming. Fungal colonization, diversity, and composition varied with altitude, but climate variables were generally weak predictors; other factors such as host plant identity, plant community composition, or edaphic variables likely drive fungal altitudinal distributions. Manipulated warming altered fungal colonization, but not composition or diversity. Leaf symbionts were more sensitive to climate and experimental warming than root symbionts. Altitudinal patterns and responses to warming differed among host plant species and fungal groups, indicating that predicting climate effects on symbioses will require tracking both host and symbiont identities. Combining experimental and observational methods can yield valuable insight into how climate change may alter plant-symbiont interactions, but our results indicate that altitude does not always serve as an adequate proxy for warming effects on fungal symbionts of plants.

AB Common approaches for summarizing multivariate environmental or community data assume that relationships among variables are stationary over time, and this assumption is often not tested. Here we test the hypothesis that relationships among environmental and community time series are nonstationary in the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem (North Pacific Ocean) over multidecadal time scales. Dynamic factor analysis (DFA) is applied to environmental and community data from before and after 1988/1989, corresponding to the timing of an abrupt decline in temporal variance of the Aleutian Low atmospheric pattern, a leading driver of Gulf of Alaska climate. Results show that covariance among local atmosphere and ocean environmental variables weakened simultaneous to the decline in Aleutian Low variance. At the same time, community-wide responses of 14 fish and crustacean populations to physical forcing weakened, as indicated by nonstationary environment-biology regression coefficients. In line with theoretical predictions, this loss of a shared response to environmental variability was accompanied by weakening community covariance. Individual populations also showed nonstationary relationships with shared trends of community variability. We conclude that assumptions of fixed environmental and community relationships are likely to produce mistaken inference in this ecosystem. Similar concerns may apply in other ecosystems subject to changing climate patterns.

AB Isolating the effects of fragmentation per se (i.e., spatial configuration of habitat patches) on species richness is an ongoing challenge as habitat configuration often covaries with the amount of habitat. Consequently, there is a lack of experimental evidence for configurational effects on species richness in the whole landscape. Here, we developed a novel experimental system for testing the independent and interactive effects of habitat area and configuration on tropical intertidal species richness. Our results confirmed the expectation that average species richness would increase monotonically with habitat area. More intriguingly, we found mixed evidence for a non-monotonic relationship between species richness and fragmentation per se, with the highest richness at intermediate fragmentation configuration, that is, when habitat tiles were placed in a "several-small" configuration. The effect of habitat configuration was not due to passive sampling (since area was controlled for), variation in total individual abundance, or niche specialization of species to different landscape configurations. We postulate that a combination of processes, including local negative density dependence and dispersal limitation, could give rise to the observed pattern. We emphasize the importance of considering configurational effects on biodiversity at broader spatial scales and for more experimental research to delve into the mechanisms driving the patterns seen here.

AB Models of dispersal potential are required to predict connectivity between populations of sessile organisms. However, to date, such models do not allow for time-varying rates of acquisition and loss of competence to settle and metamorphose, and permit only a limited range of possible survivorship curves. We collect high-resolution observations of coral larval survival and metamorphosis, and apply a piecewise modeling approach that incorporates a broad range of temporally varying rates of mortality and loss of competence. Our analysis identified marked changes in competence loss and mortality rates, the timing of which implicates developmental failure and depletion of energy reserves. Asymmetric demographic rates suggest more intermediate-range dispersal, less local retention, and less long-distance dispersal than predicted by previously employed non-piecewise models. Because vital rates are likely temporally asymmetric, at least for nonfeeding broadcast-spawned larvae, piecewise analysis of demographic rates will likely yield more reliable predictions of dispersal potential.

AB Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are key growth-limiting nutrients for organisms and their absolute and relative supplies regulate the structure and function of ecosystems. Landcover changes lead to modifications of terrestrial biogeochemistry, consequently influencing aquatic nutrient conditions. This study sought to evaluate the potential impacts of grassland degradation on nutrient availability and nutrient limitation in the Qinghai Lake (China) and its inflow streams. We sampled nutrient concentrations and tested stream nutrient limitation by conducting nutrient diffusing substrata (NDS) bioassays in streams flowing through subbasins with different grassland status. To test nutrient limitation and the responses of lake phytoplankton to stream inflows, bioassays were conducted by adding different nutrients (N, P, and joint NP) as well as water from different streams to lake water with phytoplankton, respectively. In general, N concentrations as well as N:P ratios decreased while P concentrations increased with decreased normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, an index of vegetation status), especially in September, suggesting that grassland degradation (low NDVI) has the potential to differentially decrease N availability and increase P availability in streams. Consistent with this, relative responses (RR) of stream periphyton to P and combined NP enrichments in the NDS bioassays decreased with stream P concentrations while increased with stream water N:P ratios. Lake phytoplankton responded strongly to P and combined NP addition indicating strong P-limitation of lake phytoplankton. RR of lake phytoplankton to stream water decreased with nitrate concentration and N:P ratios in stream water and increased with the concentrations of ammonium, total phosphorus, and soluble reactive phosphorus, indicating that stream water with higher P but lower N and N:P from degraded subcatchments is associated with increased impact on P-limited Lake phytoplankton. Overall, this study suggests that grassland degradation has the potential to differentially influence the nutrients delivered to streams with substantial increases in P but decreases in N and N:P, alleviating P limitation of stream periphyton and, ultimately, stimulating P-limited phytoplankton growth in the lake.

AB Changes in abundance across a natural environmental gradient provide important insights into a species' realized ecological niche. In reef-building corals, a species' niche is often defined using its depth range. However, most reef-building coral species occur over a broad depth range, a fact that is incompatible with the strong zonation found in coral assemblages across depth. We resolve this paradox by modeling the abundance distributions of 110 coral species across a 45 m depth gradient to show that most are in fact depth specialists and reveal that depth range alone is incapable of capturing a species' depth use. We then highlight the significance of our results by demonstrating how depth range greatly overestimates the potential number of species with a refuge at depth from global warming. Our findings illustrate both the limitations of the simple metric of depth range and the ecological insights that can be gained by moving beyond it.

AB Character displacement may facilitate species coexistence through niche partitioning. However, the degree to which character displacement influences broader patterns of community assembly is unclear. Here, we capitalize on a natural experiment of community assembly on the oceanic island of Bermuda. Over the past century, three species of ecologically similar but distantly related Anolis lizards have been introduced to Bermuda where no Anolis has ever naturally existed. The Jamaican anole (A. grahami) arrived first in 1905 and dispersed rapidly across the island. Five decades later, the Antiguan anole (A. leachii) and the Barbadian anole (A. extremus) were introduced to independent locations. In 1991, A. leachii and A. extremus were observed to nearly meet at a contact zone, but not yet to coexist. We record that subsequent range expansion at this contact zone has been asymmetrical; A. leachii invaded the range of A. extremus, but reciprocal invasion by A. extremus has not occurred. When in allopatry in Bermuda, both species occupy identical ecological space. However, A. leachii underwent rapid ecological character displacement to use arboreal habitat when invading the range of A. extremus. These findings highlight how character displacement may influence the process of dispersal and drive patterns of coexistence and community assembly.

AB Spatiotemporal patterns in biological communities are typically driven by environmental factors and species interactions. Spatial data from communities are naturally described by stacking models for all species in the community. Two important considerations in such multispecies or joint species distribution models (JSDMs) are measurement errors and correlations between species. Up to now, virtually all JSDMs have included either one or the other, but not both features simultaneously, even though both measurement errors and species correlations may be essential for achieving unbiased inferences about the distribution of communities and species co-occurrence patterns. We developed two presence-absence JSDMs for modeling pairwise species correlations while accommodating imperfect detection: one using a latent variable and the other using a multivariate probit approach. We conducted three simulation studies to assess the performance of our new models and to compare them to earlier latent variable JSDMs that did not consider imperfect detection. We illustrate our models with a large Atlas data set of 62 passerine bird species in Switzerland. Under a wide range of conditions, our new latent variable JSDM with imperfect detection and species correlations yielded estimates with little or no bias for occupancy, occupancy regression coefficients, and the species correlation matrix. In contrast, with the multivariate probit model we saw convergence issues with large data sets (many species and sites) resulting in very long run times and larger errors. A latent variable model that ignores imperfect detection produced correlation estimates that were consistently negatively biased, that is, underestimated. We found that the number of latent variables required to represent the species correlation matrix adequately may be much greater than previously suggested, namely around n/2, where n is community size. The analysis of the Swiss passerine data set exemplifies how not accounting for imperfect detection will lead to negative bias in occupancy estimates and to attenuation in the estimated covariate coefficients in a JSDM. Furthermore, spatial heterogeneity in detection may cause spurious patterns in the estimated species correlation matrix if not accounted for. Our new JSDMs represent an important extension of current approaches to community modeling to the common case where species presence-absence cannot be detected with certainty.

AB Although populations are phenotypically diverse, the majority of trait-based studies have focused on examining differences among species. The justification for this broadly applied approach is based on the assumption that differences among species are always greater than within species. This is likely true for local communities, but species are often broadly distributed across a wide range of environments and patterns of intraspecific variation might surpass differences among species. Therefore, an appropriate interpretation of the functional diversity requires an assessment of patterns of trait variation across different ecological scales. In this study, we examine and characterize patterns of leaf trait variation for species that are broadly distributed along an elevational gradient. We focus on seven leaf traits that represent a main axis of functional differentiation in plants reflecting the balance between photosynthetic efficiency, display, and stomatal conductance. We evaluated patterns of trait variance across ecological scales (elevation, species, populations, and individuals) and examined trait covariance at both within species and across species levels, along the elevation gradient. Our results show three key patterns: (1) intraspecific leaf trait variation for broadly distributed species is comparable to the interspecific trait variation, (2) the trait variance structure is highly variable across species, and (3) trait coordination between pairs of leaf traits is evident across species along the gradient, but not always within species. Combined, our results show that trait coordination and covariance are highly idiosyncratic across broadly distributed and co-occurring species, indicating that species may achieve similar functional roles even when exhibiting different phenotypes. This result challenges the traditional paradigm of functional ecology that assumes single trait values as optimal solutions for environments. In conclusion, patterns of trait variation both across and within species should be considered in future studies that assess trade-offs among traits over environmental gradients.

AB The temporal stability of communities is essential for the maintenance of ecosystem functioning across trophic levels. The stabilizing effect of biodiversity is, among other factors, modulated by the level of synchrony in population fluctuations among the species in the community. What drives community synchrony, however, remains largely unclear. Community synchrony can be affected by external drivers such as disturbances, but also by the properties of the community. Species with different ecological strategies should fluctuate less synchronously than more similar species; thus, an increase in diversity of ecological strategies should decrease synchrony, and increase the stability of the community. Here, using an exceptionally large data set of ground beetle trappings in Dutch heathlands (~370,000 individuals in 19 plots, each sampled between 9 and 36 yr), we assess the drivers of community stability and synchrony, and their relationship with disturbance, species richness, and functional diversity (FD). We found no effect of disturbance (fire and topsoil removal) on community stability or synchrony, probably because of unpredictable patterns of increase or decrease of the populations. Community synchrony was overall positive, giving more support for independent and positive correlation between species than for compensatory dynamics. Synchrony decreased with increasing FD, but not with species richness. Supporting this, we found that the more species pairs differ in their traits, the less synchronously their populations fluctuate, where 74% of all pairs showed no significant correlation. Significant positive synchrony (19% of species pairs) was concentrated among pairs with low trait dissimilarity, and the 7% of pairs with significant negative temporal correlation showed no relation with pairwise functional dissimilarity. The stabilizing effect of FD via decreased synchrony supports largely untested theoretical expectations that an increased diversity of functional strategies in a community will have a stabilizing effect on community abundance. We hypothesize that because competition is low in this community, the stabilizing effect of FD reflects interspecific variation in responses to environmental fluctuations rather than competition.

AB By feeding on plant tissue, insect herbivores can change several characteristics of their hosts. These changes have the potential to alter the quality of the plant for other herbivore species, potentially altering the structure of the community of species attacking the plant at a later point in time. We tested whether herbivory early in the season changes host plant performance, polyphenol chemistry, and the community structure of sessile herbivores later in the season. We experimentally manipulated densities of early-season moth caterpillars on a set of young oak trees and measured tree growth, reproduction, leaf chemistry, and the abundance and community composition of leafmining and galling species later in the season. The experimental manipulations of early-season herbivores did not affect late-season leaf chemistry or tree performance. Early-season herbivores had a weak negative effect on the abundance of gallers and a positive, tree-dependent effect on the overall diversity of late-season sessile herbivores. The chemical composition of leaves covaried with the species composition of the late-season leafmining and galling community. Both the chemical composition of the host tree and the late-season insect community structure were strongly affected by the growth location of the tree. Our results suggest that plant-mediated indirect effects between herbivores might play a limited role in this system, whereas the underlying variation in plant chemistry is an important factor structuring the associated insect community. Our results emphasize that factors other than prior herbivory can be important determinants of plant chemistry and the community composition of herbivores.

AB Recently developing hierarchical community models (HCMs) accounting for incomplete sampling are promising approaches to understand community organization. However, pros and cons of incorporating incomplete sampling in the analysis and related design issues remain unknown. In this study, we compared HCM and canonical redundancy analysis (RDA) carried out with 10 different dissimilarity coefficients to evaluate how each approach restores true community abundance data sampled with imperfect detection. We conducted simulation experiments with varying numbers of sampling sites, visits, mean detectability and mean abundance. Performance of HCM was measured by estimates of "expected" (mean) abundance (lambda<^>ij) and realized abundance (N<^>ij: direct estimate of site- and species-specific abundance). We also compared HCM and different types of RDA (normal, partial, and weighted), all performed with the same ten different dissimilarity coefficients, with unequal number of visits to sampling sites. In addition, we applied the models to a virtual survey carried out on the Barro Colorado Island tree plot data for which we know true community abundance. Simulation experiments showed that N<^>ij yielded by HCM best restored the underlying abundance of constituent species among 12 abundance estimates by HCM and RDA regardless if the sampling was equal or unequal. Mean abundance predominantly affected the performance of HCM and RDA while lambda<^>ij yielded by HCM had comparable performance to percentage difference and Gower dissimilarity coefficients of RDA. Relative performance of RDA types depended on the combination of dissimilarity coefficients and the distribution of sampling effort. Best performance of N<^>ij followed by lambda<^>ij, percentage difference and Gower dissimilarity were also observed for the analysis of tree plot data, and graphical plots (triplots) based on lambda<^>ij rather than N<^>ij clearly separated the effects of two environmental covariates on the abundance of constituent species. Under our conditions of model evaluation and the method, we concluded that, in terms of assessing the environmental dependence of abundance, HCMs and RDA can have comparable performance if we can choose appropriate dissimilarity coefficients for RDA. However, since HCMs provide straightforward biological interpretations of parameter estimates and flexibility of the analysis, HCMs would be useful in many situations as well as conventional canonical ordinations.

AB Local and global measurements of parasite prevalence and abundance are critical for understanding the dynamics that underlie the diversity, distribution, and evolution of infectious diseases. Here, we present a data set of gut helminths found in (1) raccoons throughout their range, based on primary literature from 1925-2017 and (2) raccoons in Santa Barbara County, California, USA surveyed from 2012 to 2015. The range-wide data set has 1,256 parasite entries from 217 literature sources across three continents and 32 states in the USA. This data set includes a list of all recorded raccoon gut helminths (n = 100) and their presence and prevalence in surveyed raccoon populations. The Santa Barbara data set includes gut helminth data from 182 raccoons from one Southern California County. In addition to the presence and abundance data for 13 parasite species, this data set includes measurements of 7,465 individual raccoon roundworms (Baylisascaris procyonis). For both range-wide and Santa Barbara data sets, we include information on parasite site of infection in host, sampling method, and sample size. We also provide geographic coordinates for infected raccoon populations (range-wide database) and individuals (Santa Barbara). In the associated metadata, we include sampling methods and summary figures for both the range-wide and Santa Barbara raccoon gut helminth records. There are no copyright or proprietary restrictions for research and/or teaching purposes. S. B. Weinstein and J. C. Van Wert contributed equally to this manuscript and are shared first authors.

AB Network analysis is a powerful tool to understand community-level plant-pollinator interactions. We evaluated the role of floral visitors on plant fitness through a series of pollination exclusion experiments to test the effectiveness of pollinators of an Ipomoea community in the Pacific coast of Mexico, including: (1) all flower visitors, (2) visitors that contact the reproductive organs, (3) visitors that deposit pollen on stigmas, and (4) visitors that mediate fruit and seed production. Our results show that networks built from effective pollination interactions are smaller, less connected, more specialized and modular than floral visitor networks. Modules are associated with pollinator functional groups and they provide strong support for pollination syndromes only when non-effective interactions are excluded. In contrast to other studies, the analyzed networks are not nested. Our results also show that only 59% of floral visitors were legitimate pollinators that contribute to seed production. Furthermore, only 27% of the links in visitation network resulted in seed production. Our study shows that plant-pollination networks that consider effectiveness measures of pollination in addition to floral visitation provide insightful information about the different role floral visitors play in a community, encompassing a large number of commensalistic/antagonistic interactions and the more restricted set of mutualistic relationships that underlie the evolution of convergent floral phenotypes in plants.

AB Biological nitrogen fixation is critical for the nitrogen cycle of tropical forests, yet we know little about the factors that control the microbial nitrogen fixers that colonize the microbiome of leaves and branches that make up a forest canopy. Forest canopies are especially prone to nutrient limitation because they are (1) disconnected from soil nutrient pools and (2) often subject to leaching. Earlier studies have suggested a role of phosphorus and molybdenum in controlling biological N-fixation rates, but experimental confirmation has hitherto been unavailable. Here we present the results of a manipulation of canopy nutrient availability. Our findings demonstrate a primary role of phosphorus in constraining overall N fixation by canopy cyanobacteria, but also a secondary role of molybdenum in determining per-cell fixation rates. A conservative evaluation suggests that canopy fixation can contribute to significant N fluxes at the ecosystem level, especially as bursts following atmospheric inputs of nutrient-rich dust.

AB Humans are implicated as a major driver of species extinctions from the Late Pleistocene to the present. However, our predictive understanding of human-caused extinction remains poor due to the restricted temporal and spatial scales at which this process is typically assessed, and the risks of bias due to "extinction filters" resulting from a poor understanding of past species declines. We develop a novel continent-wide data set containing country-level last-occurrence records for 31 European terrestrial mammals across the Holocene (c.11,500 yr BP to present), an epoch of relative climatic stability that captures major transitions in human demography. We analyze regional extirpations against a high-resolution database of human population density (HPD) estimates to identify species-specific tolerances to changing HPD through the Holocene. Mammalian thresholds to HPD scale strongly with body mass, with larger-bodied mammals experiencing regional population losses at lower HPDs than smaller-bodied mammals. Our analysis enables us to identify levels of tolerance to HPD for different species, and therefore has wide applicability for determining biotic vulnerability to human impacts. This ecological pattern is confirmed across wide spatiotemporal scales, providing insights into the dynamics of prehistoric extinctions and the modern biodiversity crisis, and emphasizing the role of long-term archives in understanding human-caused biodiversity loss.

AB Individual size is a major determinant of mobile organisms' ecology and behavior. This study aims to explore whether allometric scaling principles can provide an underlying framework for general patterns of resource patch use. To this end, we used giving-up densities (GUDs), that is, the amount of resources remaining in a patch after a forager has quit feeding, as a comparative measure of the amount of resources exploited by a forager of any given size. We specifically tested the hypothesis that size-dependent responses to both internal (energy requirement) and external (risk management) forces may have an effect on GUDs. We addressed this topic by conducting an extensive meta-analysis of published data on granivorous rodents, including 292 GUD measurements reported in 25 papers. The data set includes data on 22 granivorous rodent species belonging to three taxonomic suborders (Castorimorpha, Myomorpha, and Sciuromorpha) and spans three habitat types (desert, grassland, and forest). The observations refer to both patches subject to predation risk and safe patches. Pooling all data, we observed positive allometric scaling of GUDs with average forager size (scaling exponent = 0.45), which explained 15% of overall variance in individual GUDs. Perceived predation risk during foraging led to an increase in GUDs independently of forager size and taxonomy and of habitat type, which explained an additional 12% of overall GUD variance. The size scaling exponent of GUDs is positive across habitat types and taxonomic suborders of rodents. Some variation was observed, however. The scaling coefficients in grassland and forest habitat types were significantly higher than in the desert habitat type. In addition, Sciuromorpha and Myomorpha exhibited a more pronounced size scaling of GUDs than Castorimorpha. This suggests that different adaptive behaviors may be used in different contexts and/or from different foragers. With body size being a fundamental ecological descriptor, research into size scaling of GUDs may help to place patch-use observations in a broader allometric framework.

AB To decipher the long-term influences of pre-Columbian land occupations on contemporary forest structure, diversity, and functioning in Amazonia, most of the previous research focused on the alluvial plains of the major rivers of the Amazon basin. Terra firme, that is, nonflooded forests, particularly from the Guiana Shield, are yet to be explored. In this study, we aim to give new insights into the subtle traces of pre-Columbian influences on present-day forests given the archaeological context of terra firme forests of the Guiana Shield. Following archaeological prospects on 13 sites in French Guiana, we carried out forest inventories inside and outside archaeological sites and assessed the potential pre-Columbian use of the sampled tree species using an original ethnobotanical database of the Guiana Shield region. Aboveground biomass (320 and 380 T/ha, respectively), basal area (25-30 and 30-35 m(2)/ha, respectively), and tree density (550 and 700 stem/ha, respectively) were all significantly lower on anthropized plots (As) than on nonanthropized plots (NAs). Ancient human presence shaped the species composition of the sampled forests with Arecaceae, Burseraceae, and Lauraceae significantly more frequent in As and Annonaceae and Lecythidaceae more frequent in NAs. Although alpha diversity was not different between As and NAs, the presence of pre-Columbian sites enhances significantly the forest beta diversity at the landscape level. Finally, trees with edible fruits are positively associated with pre-Columbian sites, whereas trees used for construction or for their bark are negatively associated with pre-Columbian sites. Half a millennium after their abandonment, former occupied places from the inner Guiana Shield still bear noticeable differences with nonanthropized places. Considering the lack of data concerning archaeology of terra firme Amazonian forests, our results suggest that pre-Columbian influences on the structure (lower current biomass), diversity (higher beta diversity), and composition (linked to the past human tree uses) of current Amazonian forests might be more important than previously thought.

AB Species interactions in food webs are usually recognized as dynamic, varying across species, space, and time because of biotic and abiotic drivers. Yet food webs also show emergent properties that appear consistent, such as a skewed frequency distribution of interaction strengths (many weak, few strong). Reconciling these two properties requires an understanding of the variation in pairwise interaction strengths and its underlying mechanisms. We estimated stream sculpin feeding rates in three seasons at nine sites in Oregon to examine variation in trophic interaction strengths both across and within predator-prey pairs. Predator and prey densities, prey body mass, and abiotic factors were considered as putative drivers of within-pair variation over space and time. We hypothesized that consistently skewed interaction strength distributions could result if individual interaction strengths show relatively little variation, or alternatively, if interaction strengths vary but shift in ways that conserve their overall frequency distribution. Feeding rate distributions remained consistently and positively skewed across all sites and seasons. The mean coefficient of variation in feeding rates within each of 25 focal species pairs across surveys was less than half the mean coefficient of variation seen across species pairs within a survey. The rank order of feeding rates also remained conserved across streams, seasons and individual surveys. On average, feeding rates on each prey taxon nonetheless varied by a hundredfold, with some feeding rates showing more variation in space and others in time. In general, feeding rates increased with prey density and decreased with high stream flows and low water temperatures, although for nearly half of all species pairs, factors other than prey density explained the most variation. Our findings show that although individual interaction strengths exhibit considerable variation in space and time, they can nonetheless remain relatively consistent, and thus predictable, compared to the even larger variation that occurs across species pairs. These results highlight how the ecological scale of inference can strongly shape conclusions about interaction strength consistency and help reconcile how the skewed nature of interaction strength distributions can persist in highly dynamic food webs.

AB Worldwide, anthropogenic change is causing biodiversity loss, disrupting many critical ecosystem functions. Most studies investigating the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning focus on species richness, predominantly within the context of productivity-related functions. Consequently, there is limited understanding of how other biodiversity measures, such as species evenness (the distribution of abundance among species), affect complex multitrophic functions such as pollination. We explore the effect of species evenness on the ecosystem function of pollination using a controlled experiment with selected plants and insects in flight cages. We manipulated the relative abundances of plant and pollinator species, while holding species richness, composition, dominance order, and total abundance constant. Then, we tested how numerical species evenness affected network structure and consequently, seed production, in our artificial communities. Contrary to our expectation, numerical dominance in plant communities increased complementarity in pollinator use (reduced pollinator sharing) among plant species. As predicted by theory, this increased complementarity resulted in higher seed production for the most dominant and rare plant species in our cages. Our results show that in a controlled experiential setting, numerical species evenness can alter important aspects of plant-pollinator networks and plant reproduction, irrespective of species richness, composition, and total abundance. Extending this understanding of how species evenness affects ecosystem functioning to natural systems is crucial as anthropogenic disturbances continue to alter species' abundances, likely disrupting ecosystem functions long before extinctions occur.

AB The metapopulation concept initiated a paradigm shift in ecology and conservation biology, recognizing the eminent role of dispersal and colonization as fundamental processes contributing to species' long-term persistence. Early models made ad hoc assumptions about a positive area dependency of dispersal (i.e., total number of emigrants), which persisted in the theoretical literature; however, numerous empirical examples of negative area dependencies of dispersal have been reported. Here, we first give a qualitative overview for different area dependencies of dispersal in empirical systems. Then, using a spatially realistic Levins model, we show that extending assumptions on the area dependence of dispersal (ADD) to include all empirically supported parameter space, specifically also negative ADD, alters predictions on several conservation-relevant patterns. Importantly, we find that small patches could be of similar importance as large ones if dispersal decreases inversely with patch area, a result contrasting with previous findings based on a positive ADD. This leads to context-dependent strategies to preserve metapopulations. If dispersal is positively correlated with patch area, efforts should be devoted to preserving large patches and the total habitat area. If dispersal is negatively correlated with patch area, the most efficient strategy is to preserve a high number of patches, including small ones. Our results have direct implications for management decisions in the context of destruction, deterioration, and protection of habitat patches.

AB Ecotones can increase free-living species richness, but little is known about how parasites respond to ecotones. Here, we use parasite communities in raccoons (Procyon lotor) to test the hypothesis that parasite communities can be divided into core and satellite species, each with fundamentally different responses to ecotones. We used published parasite surveys to classify parasites as common core or rare satellite species, and then surveyed raccoons in coastal California to examine how proximity to two aquatic ecotones altered parasite communities. Raccoons near ecotones had more satellite and fewer core parasite species. Specifically, the marine ecotone increased parasite diversity by adding satellite species to a persistent core community, whereas the freshwater ecotone shifted the community from core to satellite species without a net change in parasite richness. We hypothesize that increased parasite richness at the marine ecotone resulted from increased diet diversity, but that raccoons were sinks for some parasites. Increased exposure to rare parasites at ecotones has implications for wildlife health and provides insight into observed associations between ecotones and emerging disease.

AB Terrestrial ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere are a globally important sink for anthropogenic CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere, slowing its accumulation as well as the pace of climate warming. With the use of a long-term field experiment (ca. 20 yr), we show that the expression of fungal class II peroxidase genes, which encode enzymes mediating the rate-limiting step of organic matter decay, are significantly downregulated (-60 to -80%) because of increases in anthropogenic N deposition; this response was consistent with a decline in extracellular peroxidase enzyme activity in soil, the slowing of organic-matter decay, and greater soil C storage. The reduction in peroxidase expression we document here occurred in the absence of a compositional shift in metabolically active fungi, indicating that an overall reduction in peroxidase expression underlies the slowing of decay and increases in soil C storage. This molecular mechanism has global implications for soil C storage and should be represented in coupled climate-biogeochemical models simulating the influence of enhanced terrestrial C storage on atmospheric CO2 and the future climate of an N-enriched Earth.

AB Information about population abundance, distribution, and demographic rates is critical for understanding a species' ecology and for effective conservation and management. To collect data over large spatial and temporal extents for such inferences, especially for species with low densities or wide distributions, citizen science can be an efficient approach. Integrated models have also emerged as an important methodology to estimate population parameters by combining multiple types of data, including citizen science data. We developed a spatially explicit integrated model that combines opportunistically collected presence-absence (PA) data, commonly collected in citizen science efforts, with systematically collected spatial capture-recapture (SCR) data, which are often limited to small spatial and temporal extents. We conducted single and multi-season simulations with parameters informed by North American black bear (Ursus americanus) populations, to evaluate the influence of varying amounts of opportunistic PA data collected at larger spatial and temporal extents on the estimation of population-level parameters. Integrating opportunistic PA data increased the precision and accuracy of posterior estimates of abundance, and survival and recruitment rates. In some cases, adding PA locations improved abundance estimates more than increasing PA detection probability. Posterior estimates were as precise and unbiased as when higher quality, but sparse, SCR data were available. We also applied the integrated model to SCR and citizen science PA data collected on black bears in New York, with results consistent with our simulations. Our findings indicate that citizen science in integrated models can be a cost-efficient way to improve estimates of population parameters and increase the spatiotemporal extent of inference. Continued developments with integrated models and citizen science data will offer additional ways to improve our understanding of population structure and demographics.

AB The pattern of sightings of a species that is rare, and then no longer observed, can be used to estimate its extinction date. However, other than physical captures or specimens, the veracity of any sighting is ambiguous, and should be treated probabilistically when used to infer extinction dates. We present a simple yet powerful computational approach for incorporating observational reliability into extinction date estimators (EDE). Our method (1) combines repeated within-year sightings probabilistically, (2) samples observations using reliability as an inclusion probability, (3) infers a probability distribution and summary statistics of extinction dates with any EDE, and (4) computes the frequency distribution of the extinction date. We applied this method to eight exemplar sighting records covering a range of lengths, sighting rates and uncertainties, using a variety of statistical EDEs, and compared these results with a threshold approach for selecting sightings. We also demonstrated a robust coverage of "true" extinction dates based on selected real-world examples of rediscovered species and confirmed extinctions, and simulated sighting records. Our approach represents a powerful generalization of past work because it is not predicated on any specific method for inferring extinction dates, and yet is simple to implement (with R script provided).

AB Bee populations have experienced declines in recent years, due in part to increased disease incidence. Multiple factors influence bee-pathogen interactions, including nectar and pollen quality and secondary metabolites. However, we lack an understanding of how plant interactions with their environment shape bee diet quality. We examined how plant interactions with the belowground environment alter floral rewards and, in turn, bee-pathogen interactions. Soil-dwelling mycorrhizal fungi are considered plant mutualists, although the outcome of the relationship depends on environmental conditions such as nutrients. In a 2 x 2 factorial design, we asked whether mycorrhizal fungi and nutrients affect concentrations of nectar and pollen alkaloids (anabasine and nicotine) previously shown to reduce infection by the gut pathogen Crithidia in the native bumble bee Bombus impatiens. To ask how plant interactions affect this common bee pathogen, we fed pollen and nectar from our treatment plants, and from a wildflower pollen control with artificial nectar, to bees infected with Crithidia. Mycorrhizal fungi and fertilizer both influenced flowering phenology and floral chemistry. While we found no anabasine or nicotine in nectar, high fertilizer increased anabasine and nicotine in pollen. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) decreased nicotine concentrations, but the reduction due to AMF was stronger in high than low-nutrient conditions. AMF and nutrients also had interactive effects on bee pathogens via changes in nectar and pollen. High fertilizer reduced Crithidia cell counts relative to low fertilizer in AMF plants, but increased Crithidia in non-AMF plants. These results did not correspond with effects of fertilizer and AMF on pollen alkaloid concentrations, suggesting that other components of pollen or nectar were affected by treatments and shaped pathogen counts. Our results indicate that soil biotic and abiotic environment can alter bee-pathogen interactions via changes in floral rewards, and underscore the importance of integrative studies to predict disease dynamics and ecological outcomes.

AB Identifying potentially invasive species and preventing their introduction and establishment are of critical importance in invasion ecology and land management. Although an extensive body of research has been dedicated to identifying traits that confer invasiveness, our current knowledge is still often inconclusive due to limitations in geographic extent and/or scope of traits analyzed. Here, using a comprehensive set of 45 traits, we performed a case study of invasive traits displayed by exotic woody plants in the United States (U.S.) by comparing 63 invasive and 794 non-invasive exotic woody plant species naturalized across the country. We found that invasive woody species often bear the following two key traits: vegetative reproduction and long-distance seed dispersal (via water, birds or mammals). Boosted classification tree models based on these traits accurately predicted species invasiveness (86% accuracy on average). Presented findings provide a generalized understanding of the relative importance of functional traits in identifying potentially invasive woody species in the U.S. The knowledge generated in this study can be used to improve current classification systems of non-native woody plants used by various U.S. governmental agencies and land managers.

AB The microbes contained within free-living organisms can alter host growth, reproduction, and interactions with the environment. In turn, processes occurring at larger scales determine the local biotic and abiotic environment of each host that may affect the diversity and composition of the microbiome community. Here, we examine variation in the diversity and composition of the foliar fungal microbiome in the grass host, Andropogon gerardii, across four mesic prairies in the central United States. Composition of fungal endophyte communities differed among sites and among individuals within a site, but was not consistently affected by experimental manipulation of nutrient supply to hosts (A. gerardii) or herbivore reduction via fencing. In contrast, mean fungal diversity was similar among sites but was limited by total plant biomass at the plot scale. Our work demonstrates that distributed experiments motivated by ecological theory are a powerful tool to unravel the multiscale processes governing microbial community composition and diversity.

AB Over the last half century, climate change, coral disease, and other anthropogenic disturbances have restructured coral-reef ecosystems on a global scale. The disproportionate loss of once-dominant, reef-building taxa has facilitated relative increases in the abundance of "weedy" or stress-tolerant coral species. Although the recent transformation of coral-reef assemblages is unprecedented on ecological timescales, determining whether modern coral reefs have truly reached a novel ecosystem state requires evaluating the dynamics of reef composition over much longer periods of time. Here, we provide a geologic perspective on the shifting composition of Florida's reefs by reconstructing the millennial-scale spatial and temporal variability in reef assemblages using 59 Holocene reef cores collected throughout the Florida Keys Reef Tract (FKRT). We then compare the relative abundances of reef-building species in the Holocene reef framework to data from contemporary reef surveys to determine how much Florida's modern reef assemblages have diverged from long-term baselines. We show that the composition of Florida's reefs was, until recently, remarkably stable over the last 8000 yr. The same corals that have dominated shallow-water reefs throughout the western Atlantic for hundreds of thousands of years, Acropora palmata, Orbicella spp., and other massive coral taxa, accounted for nearly 90% of Florida's Holocene reef framework. In contrast, the species that now have the highest relative abundances on the FKRT, primarily Porites astreoides and Siderastrea siderea, were rare in the reef framework, suggesting that recent shifts in species assemblages are unprecedented over millennial timescales. Although it may not be possible to return coral reefs to pre-Anthropocene states, our results suggest that coral-reef management focused on the conservation and restoration of the reef-building species of the past, will optimize efforts to preserve coral reefs, and the valuable ecosystem services they provide into the future.

AB Parasites are a major component of all animal populations. Males and females often differ in their levels of parasite prevalence, potentially leading to sex differences in the impact of parasitism on fitness, with important implications for the evolution of parasite and host traits including resistance, tolerance, and virulence. However, quantitative measures of the impact of parasitism under free-living conditions are extremely rare, as they require detailed host demographic data with measures of parasite burden over time. Here, we use endoscopy for direct quantification of natural-parasite burdens and relate these to reproductive success over 7 yr in a wild population of seabirds. Contrary to predictions, only female burdens were associated with negative impacts of parasitism on breeding success, despite males having significantly higher burdens. Female reproductive success declined by 30% across the range of natural parasite burdens. These effects persisted when accounting for interannual population differences in breeding success. Our results provide quantitative estimates of profound sub-lethal effects of parasitism on the population. Importantly, they highlight how parasites act unpredictably to shape ecological and evolutionary processes in different components of the same population, with implications for demography and selection on host and parasite traits.

AB The Janzen-Connell (JC) hypothesis is a major ecological explanation for high species richness, in particular in tropical forest ecosystems. Central components of the JC hypothesis are noncompetitive effects of distance and density dependence, two drivers that contribute independently to species coexistence, but are ultimately linked in the field. However, although numerous studies provide evidence for either distance- or density-dependent effects based on observational data, experimental testing of simultaneous and interactive effects of distance and density has rarely been conducted, especially in a comprehensive multispecies approach. Here, we make use of the forest Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning project (BEF) -China to estimate distance- and density-dependent effects in a reciprocal tree seedling transplant experiment of 11 tree species. We deployed 13,490 juveniles of all 11 species in their own (home) and in all foreign monocultures (away), as well as at three different levels of planting density, thereby testing for distance and density effects, respectively. In addition, to quantify the amount to which density effects were brought about by potential additional effects of intraspecific competition, we set up a common garden experiment with different levels of planting density, where an additional "shadow" treatment controlled for effects of canopy shading. Although the "away" and "high-density" treatments significantly impaired the performance and productivity of seedlings, leaf damage and survival was exclusively affected by either the home/away or the density treatment, respectively. Negative density-dependent effects on leaf damage were less pronounced in the "home" treatment, showing that the effects were not additive. In addition, results obtained in the Common Garden Experiment showed that negative effects of high density may be also brought about by intraspecific competition as an alternative density-responsive mechanism and less by true JC effects. Overall, our results provide strong support on a multispecies basis for the influence of host-specific effects already operating in early stages of a forest plantation. However, they also emphasize the need to account appropriately for potential additional density-responsive mechanisms such as intraspecific competition or microenvironmental conditions when addressing the role of JC effects for species coexistence.

AB The current decrease in biodiversity affects all ecosystems, and the impacts of diversity on ecosystem functioning need to be resolved. So far, marine studies about diversity-ecosystem productivity-relationships have concentrated on small-scale, controlled experiments, with often limited relevance to natural ecosystems. Here, we provide a real-world study on the effects of microorganismal diversity (measured as the diversity of benthic diatom communities) on ecosystem productivity (using chlorophyll a concentration as a surrogate) in a heterogeneous marine coastal archipelago. We collected 78 sediment cores at 17 sites in the northern Baltic Sea and found exceptionally high diatom diversity (328 observed species). We used structural equation models and quantile regression to explore relationships between diatom diversity and productivity. Previous studies have found contradictory results in the relationship between microorganismal diversity and ecosystem productivity, but we showed a linear and positive basal relationship between diatom diversity and productivity, which indicates that diatom diversity most likely forms the lowest boundary for productivity. Thus, although productivity can be high even when diatom diversity is low, high diatom diversity supports high productivity. The trait composition was more effective than taxonomical composition in showing such a relationship, which could be due to niche complementarity. Our results also indicated that environmental heterogeneity leads to substantial patchiness in the diversity of benthic diatom communities, mainly induced by the variation in sediment organic matter content. Therefore, future changes in precipitation and river runoff and associated changes in the quality and quantity of organic matter in the sea, will also affect diatom communities and, hence, ecosystem productivity. Our study suggests that benthic microorganisms are vital for ecosystem productivity, and together with the substantial heterogeneity of coastal ecosystems, they should be considered when evaluating the potential productivity of coastal areas.

AB Despite the advances in ecological theory, evidence for the relative importance of the different mechanisms that promote species coexistence is lacking. Some mechanisms depend on the presence of interannual fluctuations in the environment combined with interspecific differences in the responses to such fluctuations. Among coexistence mechanisms, niche differentiation and storage effects have received much attention, whereas relative non-linearity (RNL) has been thought to be an unlikely and weak mechanism for multi-species coexistence and remains untested in nature. We quantified the relative contribution of different mechanisms to the coexistence of 19 grassland species by using field-parameterized population models and invasion analysis. Our results showed that 17 out of 19 species had the potential to coexist stably. Species diversity was maintained by RNL and large fluctuation-independent niche differences, i.e., between-species differentiation that is unrelated to interannual variations in environmental factors. Moreover, RNL increased the fitness of species that were less favored by niche differentiation, contributing to their persistence in the community. Storage effect was negligible or destabilizing, making no contribution to stable coexistence. These results, altogether with recent theoretical developments and indirect evidence in published data, call for a reassessment of RNL as a relevant mechanism for multi-species coexistence in nature.

AB Reproduction by individuals is typically recorded as count data (e.g., number of fledglings from a nest or inflorescences on a plant) and commonly modeled using Poisson or negative binomial distributions, which assume that variance is greater than or equal to the mean. However, distributions of reproductive effort are often underdispersed (i.e., variance < mean). When used in hypothesis tests, models that ignore underdispersion will be overly conservative and may fail to detect significant patterns. Here we show that generalized Poisson (GP) and Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distributions are better choices for modeling reproductive effort because they can handle both overdispersion and underdispersion; we provide examples of how ecologists can use GP and CMP distributions in generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to quantify patterns in reproduction. Using a new R package, glmmTMB, we construct GLMMs to investigate how rainfall and population density influence the number of fledglings in the warbler Oreothlypis celata and how flowering rate of Heliconia acuminata differs between fragmented and continuous forest. We also demonstrate how to deal with zero-inflation, which occurs when there are more zeros than expected in the distribution, e.g., due to complete reproductive failure by some individuals.

AB Decadal-scale increases in fire frequency have the potential to deplete ecosystems of essential nutrients and consequently impede nutrient-limited biological processes via stoichiometric imbalance. Decomposition, a fundamental ecosystem function and strong driver of future fire occurrence, is highly sensitive to nutrient availability and is, therefore, particularly important in this context. Here we show that 40 yr of quadrennial (4yB) and biennial (2yB) prescribed burning result in severely P- and N-depleted litter stoichiometry, respectively, relative to fire exclusion. These effects exacerbated the nutrient limitation of microbial activities, constraining litter decomposition by 42.1% (4yB) and 23.6% (2yB) relative to unburned areas. However, invertebrate-driven decomposition largely compensated for the diminished capacity of micro-organisms under 4yB, suggesting that invertebrates could have an important stabilizing influence in fire-affected ecosystems. This effect was strongly positively coupled with the strength of microbial P-limitation and was not obviously or directly driven by fire regime-induced changes in invertebrate community assemblage. Together, our results reveal that high-frequency fire regimes promote nutrient-poor, carbon-rich ecosystem stoichiometry and, in doing so, disrupt ecosystem processes and modify the relative functionality of micro-organisms and invertebrates.

AB Coastal wetlands are susceptible to loss in both health and extent via stressors associated with global climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Peat collapse may represent an additional phenomenon contributing to coastal wetland loss in organic-rich soils through rapid vertical elevation decline. However, the term "peat collapse" has been inconsistently used in the literature, leading to ambiguities regarding the mechanisms, timing, and spatial extent of its contribution to coastal wetland loss. For example, it is unclear whether peat collapse is distinct from general subsidence, or what biogeochemical changes or sequence of events may constitute peat collapse. A critical analysis of peer-reviewed literature related to peat collapse was supplemented with fundamental principles of soil physics and biogeochemistry to develop a conceptual framework for coastal wetland peat collapse. We propose that coastal wetland peat collapse is a specific type of shallow subsidence unique to highly organic soils in which a loss of soil strength and structural integrity contributes to a decline in elevation, over the course of a few months to a few years, below the lower limit for emergent plant growth and natural recovery. We further posit that coastal wetland peat collapse is driven by severe stress or death of the vegetation, which compromises the supportive structure roots provide to low-density organic soils and shifts the carbon balance of the ecosystem toward a net source, as mineralization is no longer offset by sequestration. Under these conditions, four mechanisms may contribute to peat collapse: (1) compression of gas-filled pore spaces within the soil during dry-down conditions; (2) deconsolidation of excessively waterlogged peat, followed by transport; (3) compaction of aerenchyma tissue in wetland plant roots, and possibly collapse of root channels; and (4) acceleration of soil mineralization due to the addition of labile carbon (dying roots), oxygen (decreased flooding), nutrients (eutrophication), or sulfate (saltwater intrusion). Scientists and land managers should focus efforts on monitoring vegetation health across the coastal landscape as an indicator for peat collapse vulnerability and move toward codifying the term "peat collapse" in the scientific literature. Once clarified, the contribution of peat collapse to coastal wetland loss can be evaluated.

AB Ecologists often assume that range expansion will be fastest in landscapes composed entirely of the highest-quality habitat. Theoretical models, however, show that range expansion depends on both habitat quality and habitat-specific movement rates. Using data from 78 species in 70 studies, we find that animals typically have faster movement through lower-quality environments (73% of published cases). Therefore, if we want to manage landscapes for range expansion, there is a trade-off between promoting movement with nonhostile matrix, and promoting population growth with high-quality habitat. We illustrate how this trade-off plays out with the use of an exemplar species, the Baltimore checkerspot butterfly. For this species, we calculate that the expected rate of range expansion is fastest in landscapes with similar to 15% high-quality habitat. Behavioral responses to nonhabitat matrix have often been documented in animal populations, but rarely included in empirical predictions of range expansion. Considering movement behavior could change land-planning priorities from focus on high-quality habitat only to integrating high- and low-quality land cover types, and evaluating the costs and benefits of different matrix land covers for range expansion.

AB Aphids spread the majority of plant viruses through nonpersistent transmission (NPT), whereby virus particles attach transiently to these insects' probing mouthparts. Virus acquisition from infected plants and inoculation to healthy host plants is favored when aphids briefly probe plant epidermal cells. It is well established that NPT virus infection can alter plant-vector interactions, and, moreover, such pathogen modifications are found in a range of plant and animal systems. In particular, viruses can make plants more attractive to aphids but inhibit aphid settling on infected plants. It is hypothesized that this viral "reprogramming" of plants promotes virus acquisition and encourages dispersal of virus-bearing aphids to fresh hosts. In contrast, it is hypothesized that virus-induced biochemical changes encouraging prolonged feeding on infected hosts inhibit NPT. To understand how these virus-induced modifications affect epidemics, we developed a modeling framework accounting for important but often neglected factors, including feeding behaviors (probing or prolonged feeding) and distinct spatial scales of transmission (as conditioned by wingless or winged aphids). Analysis of our models confirmed that when viruses inhibit aphid settling on infected plants this initially promotes virus transmission. However, initially enhanced transmission is self-limiting because it decreases vector density. Another important finding is that virus-induced changes encouraging settling will stimulate birth of winged aphids, which promotes epidemics of NPT viruses over greater distances. Thus our results illustrate how plant virus modifications influence epidemics by altering vector distribution, density, and even vector form. Our insights are important for understanding how pathogens in general propagate through natural plant communities and crops.

AB Understanding how altered soil organic carbon (SOC) availability affects microbial communities and their function is imperative in predicting impacts of global change on soil carbon (C) storage and ecosystem function. However, the response of soil microbial communities and their function to depleted C availability in situ is unclear. We evaluated the role of soil C inputs in controlling microbial biomass, community composition, physiology, and function by (1) experimentally excluding plant C inputs in situ for 9 yr in four temperate forest ecosystems along a productivity gradient in Oregon, USA; and (2) integrating these findings with published data from similar C-exclusion studies into a global meta-analysis. Excluding plant C inputs for 9 yr resulted in a 13% decrease in SOC across the four Oregon sites and an overall shift in the microbial community composition, with a 45% decrease in the fungal : bacterial ratio and a 13% increase in Gram-positive : Gram-negative bacterial ratio. Although gross N mineralization decreased under C exclusion, decreases in gross N immobilization were greater, resulting in increased net N mineralization rates in all but the lowest-productivity site. Microbial biomass showed a variable response to C exclusion that was method dependent; however, we detected a 29% decrease in C-use efficiency across the sites, with greater declines occurring in less-productive sites. Although extracellular enzyme activity increased with C exclusion, C exclusion resulted in a 31% decrease in microbial respiration across all sites. Our meta-analyses of published data with similar C-exclusion treatments were largely consistent with our experimental results, showing decreased SOC, fungal : bacterial ratios, and microbial respiration, and increased Gram-positive : Gram-negative bacterial ratio following exclusion of C inputs to soil. Effect sizes of SOC and respiration correlated negatively with the duration of C exclusion; however, there were immediate effects of C exclusion on microbial community composition and biomass that were unaltered by duration of treatment. Our field-based experimental results and analyses demonstrate unequivocally the dominant control of C availability on soil microbial biomass, community composition, and function, and provide additional insight into the mechanisms for these effects in forest ecosystems.

AB We propose four postulates as the minimum set of logical propositions necessary for a theory of pulse dynamics and disturbance in ecosystems: (1) resource dynamics characterizes the magnitude, rate, and duration of resource change caused by pulse events, including the continuing changes in resources that are the result of abiotic and biotic processes; (2) energy flux characterizes the energy flow that controls the variation in the rates of resource assimilation across ecosystems; (3) patch dynamics characterizes the distribution of resource patches over space and time, and the resulting patterns of biotic diversity, ecosystem structure, and cross-scale feedbacks of pulses processes; and (4) biotic trait diversity characterizes the evolutionary responses to pulse dynamics and, in turn, the way trait diversity affects ecosystem dynamics during and after pulse events. We apply the four postulates to an important class of pulse events, biomass-altering disturbances, and derive seven generalizations that predict disturbance magnitude, resource trajectory, rate of resource change, disturbance probability, biotic trait diversification at evolutionary scales, biotic diversity at ecological scales, and functional resilience. Ultimately, theory must define the variable combinations that result in dynamic stability, comprising resistance, recovery, and adaptation.

AB Because natural ecosystems are complex, it is difficult to predict how their variability scales across space and levels of organization. The species-insurance hypothesis predicts that asynchronous dynamics among species should reduce variability when biomass is aggregated either from local species populations to local multispecies communities, or from metapopulations to metacommunities. Similarly, the spatial-insurance hypothesis predicts that asynchronous spatial dynamics among either local populations or local communities should stabilize metapopulation biomass and metacommunity biomass, respectively. In combination, both species and spatial insurance reduce variation in metacommunity biomass over time, yet these insurances are rarely considered together in natural systems. We partitioned the extent that species insurance and spatial insurance reduced the annual variation in macroalgal biomass in a southern California kelp forest. We quantified variability and synchrony at two levels of organization (population and community) and two spatial scales (local plots and region) and quantified the strength of species and spatial insurance by comparing observed variability and synchrony in aggregate biomass to null models of independent species or spatial dynamics based on cyclic-shift permutation. Spatial insurance was weak, presumably because large-scale oceanographic processes in the study region led to high spatial synchrony at both population- and community-level biomass. Species insurance was stronger due to asynchronous dynamics among the metapopulations of a few common species. In particular, a regional decline in the dominant understory kelp species Pterygophora californica was compensated for by the rise of three subdominant species. These compensatory dynamics were associated with positive values of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, indicating that differential species tolerances to warmer temperature and nutrient-poor conditions may underlie species insurance in this system. Our results illustrate how species insurance can stabilize aggregate community properties in natural ecosystems where environmental conditions vary over broad spatial scales.

AB Ecosystem functions and the biomass of lower trophic levels are frequently controlled by predators. The strength of top-down control in these trophic cascades can be affected by the identity and diversity of predators, prey, and resources, as well as environmental conditions such as temperature, moisture, and nutrient loading, which can all impact interaction strength between trophic levels. Few studies have been able to replicate a complete community over a large geographic area to compare the full trophic cascade in a manipulative experiment. Here, we identify geographic dependency in trophic cascade strength, and the driving factors and specific mechanisms behind it, by combining geographically replicated experiments with a novel approach of community analogues of common garden and transplant experiments. We studied a predator-detritivore-detritus food web in bromeliads in Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, and Brazil. We found that interaction strengths between resources, consumers, and predators were strongly site-specific, but the exact mechanism differed between trophic levels. Large bodied predators created strong interaction strengths between predator and consumer trophic levels, reducing consumer abundance regardless of the geographic location, whereas small-bodied predators created weak interactions with no impact on consumer abundances in any site. In contrast, the interaction strength between consumers and resources varied among sites, depending on the dominant species of leaf detritus. More labile leaf species in Costa Rica created a strong consumer-resource interaction and therefore strong trophic cascade, whereas tougher leaf species in Brazil created a weak consumer-resource interaction, and an overall weaker trophic cascade. Our study highlights the importance of replicating experiments over geographic scales to understand general patterns of ecological processes.

AB Ecosystems can undergo abrupt transitions between alternative stable states when the driver crosses a critical threshold. Dynamical systems theory shows that when ecosystems approach the point of loss of stability associated with these transitions, they take a long time to recover from perturbations, a phenomenon known as critical slowing down. This generic feature of dynamical systems can offer early warning signals of abrupt transitions. However, these signals are qualitative and cannot quantify the thresholds of drivers at which transition may occur. Here, we propose a method to estimate critical thresholds from spatial data. We show that two spatial metrics, spatial variance and autocorrelation of ecosystem state variable, computed along driver gradients can be used to estimate critical thresholds. First, we investigate cellular-automaton models of ecosystem dynamics that show a transition from a high-density state to a bare state. Our models show that critical thresholds can be estimated as the ecosystem state and the driver values at which spatial variance and spatial autocorrelation of the ecosystem state are maximum. Next, to demonstrate the application of the method, we choose remotely sensed vegetation data (Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI) from regions in central Africa and northeast Australia that exhibit alternative states in woody cover. We draw transects (8 x 90 km) that span alternative stable states along rainfall gradients. Our analyses of spatial variance and autocorrelation of EVI along transects yield estimates of critical thresholds. These estimates match reasonably well with those obtained by an independent method that uses large-scale (250 x 200 km) spatial data sets. Given the generality of the principles that underlie our method, our method can be applied to a variety of ecosystems that exhibit alternative stable states.

AB More than five decades ago, Ehrlich and Raven proposed a revolutionary idea-that the evolution of novel plant defense could spur adaptive radiation in plants. Despite motivating much work on plant-herbivore coevolution and defense theory, Ehrlich and Raven never proposed a mechanism for their "escape and radiate" model. Recent intriguing mechanisms proposed by Marquis et al. include sympatric divergence, pleiotropic effects of plant defense traits on reproductive isolation, and strong postzygotic isolation, but these may not be general features of herbivore-mediated speciation. An alternate view is that herbivores may impose strong divergent selection on defenses in allopatric plant populations, with plant-herbivore coevolution driving local adaptation resulting in plant speciation. Building on these ideas, we propose three scenarios that consider the role of herbivores in plant speciation. These include (1) vicariance, subsequent coevolution within populations and adaptive divergence between geographically isolated populations, (2) colonization of a new habitat lacking effective herbivores followed by loss of defense and then re-evolution and coevolution of defense in response to novel herbivores, and (3) evolution of a new defense followed by range expansion, vicariance, and coevolution. We discuss the general role of coevolution in plant speciation and consider outstanding issues related to understanding: (1) the mechanisms behind cospeciation of plants and insects, (2) geographic variation in defense phenotypes, (3) how defensive traits and geography map on plant phylogenies, and (4) the role of herbivores in driving character displacement in defense phenotypes of related species in sympatry.

AB Environmental filtering is a major mechanism structuring ecological communities. However, it is still not clear how different abiotic drivers composing the environmental filter interact with each other to determine local species assemblage and create spatial patterns in species distribution. Here, we evaluated the effects of two strong and uncorrelated environmental variables (salinity and sediment properties) on the beta-diversity of an estuarine macrobenthic community while accounting for spatial effects. Our results show that the benthic community composition has a strong spatial structure along the estuary, which can be greatly explained by salinity and sediment variation. Salinity is most associated with species replacement (turnover), whereas sediment is more important for species loss (nestedness). However, the effects of sediment variation on nestedness are mainly detected at a smaller spatial scale (estuarine sectors), whereas the effects of salinity on species turnover are stronger as spatial scale increases (entire estuary). Our findings suggest that environmental filters can drive both turnover and nestedness components of beta-diversity, but that their relative importance depends on the spatial scale of investigation. Although abiotic drivers associated with detrimental effects (sediment) usually result in nestedness, larger spatial scales encompass abiotic drivers associated with different suitable conditions (salinity), increasing the relative importance of the replacement component of species beta-diversity.

AB The vulnerability of an individual to predation depends on the availability of other prey items in the surrounding environment. Interspecific prey aggregations or "neighborhoods" may therefore affect an individual's vulnerability to predation. We examined the influence of prey neighborhood structure (i.e., the densities and identities of prey neighborhoods) on spatial variation in predation in a multi-prey system with a primary apex predator. We combined GPS locations of lions (Panthera leo), kill-site surveys, and spatially explicit density estimates of five species of ungulates for which a significant level of predation was attributable to lions. In addition to the dual influence of predator activity and vegetation, predation risk was attributable to the structure of prey neighborhoods for at least two of the five species of prey. Along with traditionally recognized components of predation (the rate of predator-prey encounters and prey catchability), we encourage ecologists to consider how prey neighborhood structure influences spatial variation in predation risk.

We selected terrestrial non-volant mammals because they are among the most studied groups, have greater availability of historical distribution data for the 1970s decade, and also show the largest range contractions compared to other taxonomic groups. Species belong to 52 families and 16 orders. Range maps were extracted from scientific literature including published papers, books, and action plans. For Australian species, due to the absence of published maps, we collated occurrence data from individual data sets (maintained by museums and government agencies) and converted these into polygonal range maps. Taxonomic and geographic biases towards more studied (charismatic) species are inevitably present. Among the most abundant orders, the highest percentage representation is for Carnivora (55 species, corresponding to 21% of species in the order), Cetartiodactyla (24 species, 10% of the order), and Perissodactyla (six species, 38% of the order). In contrast, the percentage representation is low for Rodentia (66 species, 3% of species in the order), Primates (19 species, 4%), and Eulipotyphla (6 species, 1%). The proportional representation of less speciose orders is highly variable. The data set offers the opportunity to measure the recent (1970-2019) change in the distribution of terrestrial mammal species, and test ecological and biogeographical hypotheses about such change. It also allows us to identify areas where changes in species distribution were largest.

AB Understanding how biodiversity influences ecosystem functioning is one of the central goals of modern ecology. The early and often acrimonious debates about the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning were largely resolved following the advent of a statistical partitioning scheme that decomposed the net effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning into a "selection" effect and a "complementarity" effect. Here we show that both the biodiversity effect and its statistical decomposition into selection and complementarity are fundamentally flawed because these methods use a naive null expectation based on neutrality, likely leading to an overestimate of the net biodiversity effect, and because they fail to account for the nonlinear abundance-ecosystem-functioning relationships widely observed in nature. Furthermore, under nonlinearity no such statistical scheme can be devised to partition the biodiversity effect. We also present an alternative approach that provides a more reasonable starting point for estimating biodiversity effects. Overall, our results suggest that all studies conducted since the early 1990s are likely to have overestimated the positive effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning.

AB Invasive plants can increase soil nitrogen (N) pools and accelerate soil N cycling rates, but their effect on gross N cycling and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions has rarely been studied. We hypothesized that perennial pepperweed (Lepidium latifolium) invasion would increase rates of N cycling and gaseous N loss, thereby depleting ecosystem N and causing a negative feedback on invasion. We measured a suite of gross N cycling rates and net N2O fluxes in invaded and uninvaded areas of an annual grassland in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta region of northern California. During the growing season, pepperweed-invaded soils had lower microbial biomass N, gross N mineralization, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), and denitrification-derived net N2O fluxes (P < 0.02 for all). During pepperweed dormancy, gross N mineralization, DNRA, and denitrification-derived net N2O fluxes were stimulated in pepperweed-invaded plots, presumably by N-rich litter inputs and decreased competition between microbes and plants for N (P < 0.04 for all). Soil organic carbon and total N concentrations, which reflect pepperweed effects integrated over longer time scales, were lower in pepperweed-invaded soils (P P = 0.04, respectively). Overall, pepperweed invasion had a net negative effect on ecosystem N status, depleting soil total N to potentially cause a negative feedback to invasion in the long term.

TI The Australian National Rabbit Database: 50 yr of population monitoring

AB With ongoing introductions into Australia since the 1700s, the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) has become one of the most widely distributed and abundant vertebrate pests, adversely impacting Australia's biodiversity and agroeconomy. To understand the population and range dynamics of the species and its impacts better, occurrence and abundance data have been collected by researchers and citizens from sites covering a broad spectrum of climatic and environmental conditions in Australia. The lack of a common and accessible repository for these data has, however, limited their use in determining important spatiotemporal drivers of the structure and dynamics of the geographical range of rabbits in Australia. To meet this need, we created the Australian National Rabbit Database, which combines more than 50 yr of historical and contemporary survey data collected from throughout the range of the species in Australia. The survey data, obtained from a suite of complementary monitoring methods, were combined with high-resolution weather, climate, and environmental information, and an assessment of data quality. The database provides records of rabbit occurrence (689,265 records) and abundance (51,241 records, >120 distinct sites) suitable for identifying the spatiotemporal drivers of the rabbit's distribution and for determining spatial patterns of variation in its key life-history traits, including maximum rates of population growth. Because all data are georeferenced and date stamped, they can be coupled with information from other databases and spatial layers to explore the potential effects of rabbit occurrence and abundance on Australia's native wildlife and agricultural production. The Australian National Rabbit Database is an important tool for understanding and managing the European rabbit in its invasive range and its effects on native biodiversity and agricultural production. It also provides a valuable resource for addressing questions related to the biology, success, and impacts of invasive species more generally.

TI NEOTROPICAL XENARTHRANS: a data set of occurrence of xenarthran species

AB Xenarthrans-anteaters, sloths, and armadillos-have essential functions for ecosystem maintenance, such as insect control and nutrient cycling, playing key roles as ecosystem engineers. Because of habitat loss and fragmentation, hunting pressure, and conflicts with domestic dogs, these species have been threatened locally, regionally, or even across their full distribution ranges. The Neotropics harbor 21 species of armadillos, 10 anteaters, and 6 sloths. Our data set includes the families Chlamyphoridae (13), Dasypodidae (7), Myrmecophagidae (3), Bradypodidae (4), and Megalonychidae (2). We have no occurrence data on Dasypus pilosus (Dasypodidae). Regarding Cyclopedidae, until recently, only one species was recognized, but new genetic studies have revealed that the group is represented by seven species. In this data paper, we compiled a total of 42,528 records of 31 species, represented by occurrence and quantitative data, totaling 24,847 unique georeferenced records. The geographic range is from the southern United States, Mexico, and Caribbean countries at the northern portion of the Neotropics, to the austral distribution in Argentina, Paraguay, Chile, and Uruguay. Regarding anteaters, Myrmecophaga tridactyla has the most records (n = 5,941), and Cyclopes sp. have the fewest (n = 240). The armadillo species with the most data is Dasypus novemcinctus (n = 11,588), and the fewest data are recorded for Calyptophractus retusus (n = 33). With regard to sloth species, Bradypus variegatus has the most records (n = 962), and Bradypus pygmaeus has the fewest (n = 12). Our main objective with Neotropical Xenarthrans is to make occurrence and quantitative data available to facilitate more ecological research, particularly if we integrate the xenarthran data with other data sets of Neotropical Series that will become available very soon (i.e., Neotropical Carnivores, Neotropical Invasive Mammals, and Neotropical Hunters and Dogs). Therefore, studies on trophic cascades, hunting pressure, habitat loss, fragmentation effects, species invasion, and climate change effects will be possible with the Neotropical Xenarthrans data set. Please cite this data paper when using its data in publications. We also request that researchers and teachers inform us of how they are using these data.

AB Stable coexistence relies on negative frequency-dependence, in which rarer species invading a patch benefit from a lack of conspecific competition experienced by residents. In nature, however, rarity can have costs, resulting in positive frequency-dependence (PFD) particularly when species are rare. Many processes can cause positive frequency-dependence, including a lack of mates, mutualist interactions, and reproductive interference from heterospecifics. When species become rare in the community, positive frequency-dependence creates vulnerability to extinction, if frequencies drop below certain thresholds. For example, environmental fluctuations can drive species to low frequencies where they are then vulnerable to PFD. Here, we analyze deterministic and stochastic mathematical models of two species interacting through both PFD and resource competition in a Chessonian framework. Reproductive success of individuals in these models is reduced by a product of two terms: the reduction in fecundity due to PFD, and the reduction in fecundity due to competition. Consistent with classical coexistence theory, the effect of competition on individual reproductive success exhibits negative frequency-dependence when individuals experience greater intraspecific competition than interspecific competition, i.e., niche overlap is less than one. In the absence of environmental fluctuations, our analysis reveals that (1) a synergistic effect of PFD and niche overlap that hastens exclusion, (2) trade-offs between susceptibility to PFD and maximal fecundity can mediate coexistence, and (3) coexistence, when it occurs, requires that neither species is initially rare. Analysis of the stochastic model highlights that environmental fluctuations, unless perfectly correlated, coupled with PFD ultimately drive one species extinct. Over any given time frame, this extinction risk decreases with the correlation of the demographic responses of the two species to the environmental fluctuations, and increases with the temporal autocorrelation of these fluctuations. For species with overlapping generations, these trends in extinction risk persist despite the strength of the storage effect decreasing with correlated demographic responses and increasing with temporal autocorrelations. These results highlight how the presence of PFD may alter the outcomes predicted by modern coexistence mechanisms.

AB Detrital-based trophic cascades are often considered weak or absent in tropical stream ecosystems because of the prevalence of omnivorous macroconsumers and the dearth of leaf-shredding insects. In this study, we isolate top-down effects of three macroconsumer species on detrital processing in headwater streams draining Trinidad's northern mountains. We separated effects of different macroconsumers by experimentally manipulating their temporal access to isolated benthic habitat over the diel cycle. We found no evidence that omnivorous macroconsumers, including a freshwater crab (Eudaniela garmani) and guppy (Poecilia reticulata), increased leaf decomposition via consumption. By contrast, above a waterfall excluding guppies, the insectivorous killifish, Anablepsoides hartii, reduced the biomass of the leaf-shredding insect Phylloicus hansoni 4-fold, which consequently reduced leaf decomposition rates 1.6-fold. This detrital cascade did not occur below the barrier waterfall, where omnivorous guppies join the assemblage and reduce killifish densities; here killifish had no significant effects on Phylloicus or decomposition rates. These patterns of detrital processing were also observed in upstream-downstream comparisons in a landscape study across paired reaches of six streams. Above waterfalls, where killifish were present, but guppies absent, leaf decomposition rates and Phylloicus biomass were 2.5- and similar to 35-fold lower, respectively, compared to measurements below waterfalls. Moreover, the strength of top-down control by killifish is reflected by the 20- and 5-fold reductions in variability (+/- SE) surrounding mean Phylloicus biomass and leaf decomposition rates in upstream relative to downstream reaches where no top-down control was detected. Findings show a clear, detrital-based trophic cascade among killifish, a leaf-shredding insect, and leaf decomposition rates. Results also show how omnivorous guppies disrupt this cascade by depressing killifish densities, thereby releasing invertebrate shredders from predation, and significantly increasing decomposition rates. Moreover, this combination of direct and indirect trophic interactions drives patterns in decomposition rates in stream networks at a landscape scale, resulting in significantly lower rates of decomposition above vs. below barrier waterfalls. Our findings reveal that omnivory can result in significant indirect effects on a key ecosystem process, illustrating the importance of these hidden trophic pathways in detrital-based systems and suggesting that resource control in tropical systems may be even more complex than previously envisioned.

AB The spatial relationship between predator and prey is often conceptualized as a behavioral response race, in which prey avoid predators while predators track prey. Limiting habitat types can create spatial anchors for prey or predators, influencing the likelihood that the predator or prey response will dominate. Joint spatial anchors emerge when predator and prey occupy similar feeding habitat domains and risk and reward become spatially conflated, confusing predictions of which player will win the space race. These spatial dynamics of risk-foraging trade-offs are often obscured by habitat heterogeneity and community complexity in large vertebrate systems, fueling ambiguity regarding the generality of predictions from predator-prey theory. To test how habitat distribution influences the predator-prey space race, we examine correlation in puma and vicuna habitat selection and space use at two sites, one of which generates a distinct risk-foraging trade-off at a joint spatial anchor. The distribution of vegetation, which serves as both forage for vicunas and stalking cover for pumas, differs between the sites; the llano contains a single central meadow that acts as a joint spatial anchor, while the canyon is characterized by more heterogeneous vegetation. Puma-vicuna habitat selection correlation was positive in the llano and negative in the canyon, and similarly, utilization distributions were more strongly correlated in the llano than the canyon. Vicuna locations occurred at higher values of puma habitat selection and utilization in the llano than in the canyon. Similarly, puma locations in the llano occurred at higher values of vicuna habitat selection and utilization than in the canyon. Although pumas consistently selected for and utilized vegetative and topographic cover regardless of habitat distribution, vicunas only selected against vegetation in the heterogeneous canyon site, reducing spatial correlation with pumas. Our work suggests a joint spatial anchor favors pumas in the space race due to the inability for vicunas to avoid crucial foraging habitat. The outcome of the predator-prey space race appears to be strongly informed by the distribution of habitat, whereby corresponding predictability of predator and prey favors predators in the spatial game.

AB Ecosystems where severe disturbance has induced permanent shifts in vegetation and soil processes may represent alternative stable states. To date, little is known on how long-lasting changes in soil processes are following such disturbances, and how the changes in plant and soil processes between the alternative states eventually manifest themselves in soil organic matter (SOM) storage. Here, we analyzed plant density, the shrub : forb ratio, microbial respiration, extracellular enzyme activities and SOM stocks in soils of subarctic tundra and historical milking grounds, where reindeer herding induced a vegetation transition from deciduous shrubs to graminoids several centuries earlier but were abandoned a century ago. This provides the possibility to compare sites with similar topography, but highly contrasting vegetation for centuries. We found that enzymatic activities and N:P stoichiometry differed between control and disturbed sites, confirming that culturally induced vegetation shifts exert lasting impacts on tundra soil processes. Transition zones, where shrubs had encroached into the historical milking grounds during the past 50 yr, indicated that microbial activities for N and P acquisition changed more rapidly along a vegetation shift than those for microbial C acquisition. Although plant and soil processes differed between control and disturbed sites, we found no effect of historical vegetation transition on SOM stock. Across the study sites, soil SOM stocks were correlated with total plant density but not with the shrub : forb ratio. Our finding that SOM stock was insensitive to a centennial difference in plant community composition suggests that, as such, grazing-induced alternative vegetation states might not necessarily differ in SOM sequestration.

AB Invasive species can alter the structure and function of the communities they invade, as well as lead to biotic homogenization across their invasive range, thus affecting large-scale diversity patterns. The mechanisms by which invasive species can lead to biotic homogenization are poorly understood. We argue that invasive species acting as strong, deterministic, and consistent filters within and across invaded communities are likely to cause biotic homogenization at multiple spatial scales. We studied Bromus inermis Leyss. invasion into eight grasslands covering most of the grassland and parkland natural regions of Alberta (western Canada). Specifically, we tested whether B. inermis (1) has a strong impact on species richness and composition, (2) consistently alters resources (nutrients, light, and soil moisture), imposing the same ecological filter to species establishment and persistence across sites, and hence (3) whether it leads to biotic homogenization within and across sites. We recorded plant cover and resources across native-to-invaded transition areas combining space-for-time substitutions with time-series data analyses. Bromus inermis invasion was associated with rapid biotic homogenization of communities, within and among the eight grasslands. The sharp changes in species relative abundances following invasion was the initial driver of biotic homogenization, and species loss was delayed. Supporting the idea that biotic homogenization can occur when an invasive species presents a broad and consistent filter, resources modified by B. inermis invasion (particularly light and certain nutrients) were altered rather consistently within and across sites. The 50% reduction in light was likely the initial driver of biotic homogenization, and the increase in nutrient availability probably facilitates the displacement of species from the invaded areas and could lead to the establishment of self-reinforcing dynamics. Overall, our results support the idea that invaders acting as strong, deterministic, and consistent ecological filters are likely to cause biotic homogenization of the communities they invade.

AB Fire is a critical force in structuring ecosystems, but it also removes substantial amounts of nitrogen (N), which can limit plant growth. Biological N fixation (BNF) may alleviate fire-induced N deficiencies that inhibit ecosystem recovery, yet if and how BNF achieves this under frequent fire is unclear. This problem is further complicated in the context of modern human influences (such as land-use history and atmospheric N deposition), which may confound the relationship between fire and fixation. Here, we investigate whether BNF supplies the N necessary to replace fire-induced N losses in restored longleaf pine savannas, and, if so, what factors control fixation. We established 54 1-ha plots of longleaf pine capturing 227 yr of forest recovery and a broad gradient of fire return interval (1.5-20 yr) at two sites in the southeastern United States. We quantified N fixation from three functional groups (herbaceous legumes, soil crusts, and asymbiotic N fixing bacteria), N losses from individual fire events and ecosystem dynamics of N supply and demand. We found that BNF rates were low but sustained over stand age but were substantially below estimated rates of atmospheric N deposition. While fire temporarily stimulated BNF from herbaceous legumes, neither BNF nor atmospheric N deposition were sufficient to balance N losses from fire and soil N stocks declined over stand age. However, rates of N mineralization were surprisingly high and tree productivity was unrelated to N availability, questioning the importance of N limitation in these temperate savannas. While it is possible that progressive N losses signal a decline in ecosystem resiliency, N enrichment from multiple land-use transitions and anthropogenic N deposition may suppress rates of BNF or diminish its importance as a long-term N balancing source in these pyrogenic ecosystems. In this case, fire may be acting as relief mechanism, critical for returning the modern longleaf pine landscape to its historical oligotrophic condition.

AB Within food webs, vectors of plant pathogens interact with individuals of other species across multiple trophic levels, including predators, competitors, and mutualists. These interactions may in turn affect vector-borne pathogens by altering vector fitness and behavior. Predators, for example, consume vectors and reduce their abundance, but often spur movement of vectors as they seek to avoid predation. However, a general framework to predict how species interactions affect vectors of plant pathogens, and the resulting spread of vector-borne pathogens, is lacking. Here we developed a mathematical model to assess whether interactions such as predation, competition, and mutualism affected the spread of vector-borne plant pathogens with nonpersistent or persistent transmission modes. We considered transmission mode because interactions affecting vector-host encounter rates were expected to most strongly affect nonpersistent pathogens that are transmitted with short feeding bouts; interactions that affect vector feeding duration were expected to most strongly affect persistent pathogens that require long feeding bouts for transmission. Our results show that interactions that affected vector behavior (feeding duration, vector-host encounter rates) substantially altered rates of spread for vector-borne plant pathogens, whereas those affecting vector fitness (births, deaths) had relatively small effects. These effects of species interactions were largely independent of transmission mode, except when interactions affected vector-host encounter rates, where effects were strongest for nonpersistent pathogens. Our results suggest that a better understanding of how vectors interact with other species within food webs could enhance our understanding of disease ecology.

AB Organisms architecturally modify environments and these modifications may persist across generations, potentially strongly shaping social behavior. However, few experiments have directly tested the impact of architectural modifications from earlier generations on social behavior in later generations. Here, I report experiments using extremely durable resources, shells, which endure for decades to centuries in stable form. Terrestrial hermit crabs (Coenobita compressus) architecturally remodel shells and pass these modified shelters to subsequent generations, which reuse them long after the original architect's death. I conducted controlled field experiments in a population of these crabs in which shells have been individually marked and tracked for a decade. I examined the impact of architectural modifications by contrasting social behavior around introduced shells, either remodeled shells (whose internal architecture was modified by earlier generations) or unremodeled shells (whose architecture had never been modified). Remodeled shells generated radically different social dynamics than unremodeled shells, catalyzing vacancy chains in which shells were socially redistributed across the population. Social groups that formed around remodeled shells consisted of size-ordered queues, with precise timing and social coordination required if individuals were to acquire superior shells. Interestingly, comparative experiments in two non-architect species (Clibanarius albidigitus and Calcinus obscurus) failed to show any impact of architectural modifications on social behavior; such impacts were only found in the architect species (C. compressus). Broadly, architecture from earlier generations can thus play a major role in driving social dynamics among later generations.

AB Changes in day (maximum temperature, T-MAX) and night temperature (minimum temperature, T-MIN) in the preseason (e.g., winter and spring) may have opposite effects on early phenophases (e.g., leafing and flowering) due to changing requirements of chilling accumulations (CAC) and heating accumulations (HAC), which could cause advance, delay or no change in early phenophases. However, their relative effects on phenology are largely unexplored, especially on the Tibetan Plateau. Here, observations were performed using a warming and cooling experiment in situ through reciprocal transplantation (2008-2010) on the Tibetan Plateau. We found that winter minimum temperature (T-MIN) warming significantly delayed mean early phenophases by 8.60 d/degrees C, but winter maximum temperature (T-MAX) warming advanced them by 12.06 d/degrees C across six common species. Thus, winter mean temperature warming resulted in a net advance of 3.46 d/degrees C in early phenophases. In contrast, winter T-MIN cooling, on average, significantly advanced early phenophases by 5.12 d/degrees C, but winter T-MAX cooling delayed them by 7.40 d/degrees C across six common species, resulting in a net delay of 2.28 d/degrees C for winter mean temperature cooling. The opposing effects of T-MAX and T-MIN warming on the early phenophases may be mainly caused by decreased CAC due to T-MIN warming (5.29 times greater than T-MAX) and increased HAC due to T-MAX warming (3.25 times greater than T-MIN), and similar processes apply to T-MAX and T-MIN cooling. Therefore, our study provides another insight into why some plant phenophases remain unchanged or delayed under climate change.

AB Understanding how habitat structure and resource availability affect local species distributions is a key goal of community ecology. Where habitats occur as a mosaic, variation in connectivity among patches influences both local species richness and composition, and connectivity is a key conservation concern in fragmented landscapes. Similarly, availability of limiting resources frequently determines species coexistence or exclusion. For primarily cursorial arthropods like ants, gaps between neighboring trees are a significant barrier to movement through the forest canopy. Competition for limited resources such as nest sites also promotes antagonistic interactions. Lianas (woody vines) connect normally isolated neighboring tree crowns and often have hollow stems inhabited by ants. We used two large-scale liana-removal experiments to determine how connectivity and nest site availability provided by lianas affect arboreal ant species richness, species composition, and beta-diversity in a lowland tropical forest in Panama. Removing lianas from a tree crown reduced ant species richness up to 35%, and disproportionately affected species that require large foraging areas. Adding artificial connectivity to trees mitigated the effects of liana removal. Ant colonization of artificial nests was higher (73% occupied) in trees without lianas vs. trees with lianas (28% occupied). However, artificial nests typically were colonized by existing polydomous, resident ant species. As a result, nest addition did not affect ant community structure. Collectively, these results indicate that lianas are important to the maintenance of arboreal ant diversity specifically by providing connectivity among neighboring tree crowns. Anticipated increases in liana abundance in this forest could increase the local (tree-level) species richness of arboreal ants, with a compositional bias toward elevating the density of broad-ranging specialist predators.

AB We examined the extent to which supply-side, niche, and competition theories and concepts help explain a trematode community in which one species comprises 87% of the trematode individuals, and the remaining 15 species each have Heleobia australis over four seasons from three distinct habitats from the intertidal area of the Bahia Blanca estuary, Argentina. Inside a snail, trematodes interact with each other with outcomes that depend on facilitation, competition, and preemption, suggesting that dominant species should be common. The abundant trematode species, Microphallus simillimus, is a weak competitor, but has life-history traits and strategies associated with higher colonization ability that could increase its probability of invading the host first, allowing it to preempt the rare species. Rather than segregate by habitat, trematode species aggregated in pans during the summer where dominant trematode species often excluded subordinate ones. Despite losses to competition, and a lack of niche partitioning, M. simillimus ruled this species-rich trematode guild through strong recruitment and (potentially) preemption. Therefore, extremely skewed species abundance distributions, like this one, can derive from extremely skewed colonization abilities.

AB To understand how migratory behavior evolved and to predict how migratory species will respond to global environmental change it is important to quantify the fitness consequences of intra- and inter-individual variation in migratory behavior. Intra-individual variation includes behavioral responses to changing environmental conditions and hence behavioral plasticity in the context of novel or variable conditions. Inter-individual variation determines the degree of variation on which selection can act and the rate of evolutionary responses to changes in average and extreme environmental conditions. Here we focus on variation in the partial migratory behavior of giant Galapagos tortoises (Chelonoidis spp.) and its energetic consequences. We evaluate the extent and mechanisms by which tortoises adjust migration timing in response to varying annual environmental conditions, and integrate movement data within a bioenergetic model of tortoise migration to quantify the fitness consequences of migration timing. We find strong inter-individual variation in the timing of migration, which was not affected by environmental conditions prevailing at the time of migration but rather by average expectations estimated from multi-annual averaged conditions. This variation is associated with an average annual loss in efficiency of 15% relative to optimal timing based on year-specific conditions. These results point towards a limited ability of tortoises to adjust the timing of their migrations based on prevailing (and, by extension, future) conditions, suggesting that the adaptability of tortoise migratory behavior to changing conditions is predicated more by past "normal" conditions than responses to prevailing, changing conditions. Our work offers insights into the level of environmental-tuning in migratory behavior and a general framework for future research across taxa.

AB Modeling the dynamics of competition and coexistence between species is crucial to predict long-term impacts of invasive species on their native congeners. However, natural environments are often fragmented and variable in time and space. In such contexts, regional coexistence depends on complex interactions between competition, niche differentiation and stochastic colonization-extinction dynamics. Quantifying all these processes at landscape scale has always been a challenge for ecologists. We propose a new statistical framework to evaluate metapopulation parameters (colonization and extinction) in a two-species system and how they respond to environmental variables and interspecific competition. It requires spatial surveys repeated in time, but does not assume demographic equilibrium. We apply this model to a long-term survey of two snails inhabiting a network of freshwater habitats in the West Indies. We find evidence of reciprocal competition affecting colonization or extinction rates, modulated by species-specific sensitivity to environmental variables. Simulations using model estimates allow us to predict species dynamics and explore the role of various coexistence mechanisms described by metacommunity theory in our system. The two species are predicted to stably coexist, because niche partitioning, source-sink dynamics and interspecific differences in extinction-colonization parameters all contribute to reduce the negative impacts of competition. However, none of these mechanisms is individually essential. Regional coexistence is primarily facilitated by transient co-occurrence of the two species within habitat patches, a possibility generally not considered in theoretical metacommunity models. Our framework is general and could be extended to guilds of several competing species.

AB Understanding and accurately modeling species distributions lies at the heart of many problems in ecology, evolution, and conservation. Multiple sources of data are increasingly available for modeling species distributions, such as data from citizen science programs, atlases, museums, and planned surveys. Yet reliably combining data sources can be challenging because data sources can vary considerably in their design, gradients covered, and potential sampling biases. We review, synthesize, and illustrate recent developments in combining multiple sources of data for species distribution modeling. We identify five ways in which multiple sources of data are typically combined for modeling species distributions. These approaches vary in their ability to accommodate sampling design, bias, and uncertainty when quantifying environmental relationships in species distribution models. Many of the challenges for combining data are solved through the prudent use of integrated species distribution models: models that simultaneously combine different data sources on species locations to quantify environmental relationships for explaining species distribution. We illustrate these approaches using planned survey data on 24 species of birds coupled with opportunistically collected eBird data in the southeastern United States. This example illustrates some of the benefits of data integration, such as increased precision in environmental relationships, greater predictive accuracy, and accounting for sample bias. Yet it also illustrates challenges of combining data sources with vastly different sampling methodologies and amounts of data. We provide one solution to this challenge through the use of weighted joint likelihoods. Weighted joint likelihoods provide a means to emphasize data sources based on different criteria (e.g., sample size), and we find that weighting improves predictions for all species considered. We conclude by providing practical guidance on combining multiple sources of data for modeling species distributions.

AB Patterns of feeding interactions between species are thought to influence the stability of communities and the flux of nutrients and energy through ecosystems. However, surprisingly few well-resolved food webs allow us to evaluate factors that influence the architecture of species interactions. We constructed a meta food web consisting of 714 invertebrate species collected over 9 years of suction and pitfall sampling campaigns in the Jena Experiment, a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment located in Jena, Germany. We summarize information on the 51,496 potential trophic links, which were established using information on diet specificity and species traits that typically constrain feeding interactions (trophic group, body size, and vertical stratification). The list of species identities, traits, and link-derivation rules will be useful not only for tests of plant diversity effects on food web structure within the Jena Experiment, but also for considering consistent construction of food webs from empirical data, and for comparisons of network structure across ecosystems.

AB Light and temperature are key drivers of ecosystem productivity, but synchrony of their annual cycles typically obscures their relative influence. The coupling of annual light-temperature regimes also drives complementary seasonal cycles of energy supply (primary production) and demand (metabolism), perhaps promoting temporal stability in carbon (C) storage and food web production that may be difficult to discern in most ecosystems. Spring-fed streams in the Arctic are subject to extreme annual fluctuations in light availability but have relatively stable water temperatures, which allows assessment of the independent effects of light and temperature. We used the unusual annual light and temperature regimes of Ivishak Spring, Alaska, USA (latitude 69 degrees N, annual water temperature range 4-7 degrees C) to test predictions about the effect of light availability on consumer productivity with minimally confounding effects of temperature. We predicted that (1) annual patterns of secondary production would follow patterns of primary production, rather than temperature, due to organic C limitation during winter darkness when photosynthesis is effectively halted, (2) C limitation would propagate from primary producers upward through several trophic levels, (3) the lack of temperature dependence during winter darkness would be expressed as anomalous Arrhenius plots of growth rates indicating decoupled production-temperature relationships, and (4) consumer diets would reflect C limitation during winter. As predicted, we found (1) lowest production by macroinvertebrates and Salvelinus malma (Dolly Varden char) at the lowest light levels rather than the lowest temperatures, (2) apparent winter C limitation propagated upward through three trophic levels, (3) anomalous Arrhenius plots indicating lack of temperature dependence of consumer growth rates during winter, and (4) lowest consumption of diatoms (by macroinvertebrates) and invertebrate prey (by S. malma) during winter. Together, these results indicate that light drives annual patterns of animal production in Ivishak Spring, with stable annual temperatures likely exacerbating C limitation of ectotherm metabolism during winter. The timing and severity of winter C limitation in this unusual Arctic-spring food web highlight a fundamental role for light-temperature synchrony in matching energy supply with demand in most other ecosystem types, thereby conferring a measure of stability in the metabolism of their food webs over annual time scales.

AB The competitive exclusion principle is fundamental to understanding coexistence. Well-established theories predict the conditions for coexistence in consumer-resource interactions. Given that species often compete for commodities offered by mutualists, competitive exclusion theory should also be critical to understanding how mutualisms function. We explicitly apply the competitive exclusion principle to mutualism and derive a rule analogous to Tilman's R* rule for exploitative competition. Coexistence is impossible when competitors compete solely for a shared partner-provided commodity because superior competitors deplete that commodity sufficiently to exclude inferior competitors. We then investigate how competition between two guild members for a partner-provided commodity and a resource external to the mutualism affects competitor coexistence. There are three key results. First, coexistence is possible via partitioning of a partner-provided commodity and another resource. Second, unlike in classic R* Theory, competitive outcomes are influenced both by species' abilities to obtain commodities and their mutualisms with the shared commodity-providing partner, which can indirectly alleviate competitors' commodity limitation. Third, the outcome of competition has important consequences for the commodity-providing partner, which depend on the type of mutualism and the competitive abilities of competing mutualists. This theory provides a novel framework for investigating how competitors for mutualistic commodities coexist in nature.

TI Population projection models for 14 alien plant species in the presence

SO ECOLOGY

   population dynamics
AB Plant population ecologists strive to understand how environmental drivers influence demographic vital rates and thus population dynamics. Hundreds of studies have collected demographic data and used matrix and/or integral projection models to quantify lifetime fitness and population dynamics of plants. However, most of these studies have focused on native plant species, and there is a need for more studies on alien plants. Further, few studies on alien plants have experimentally manipulated environmental drivers in order to understand the mechanisms that allow alien plant species to have positive population growth. A synthetic understanding of the population dynamics of alien plant species will only be achieved if ecologists collect demographic data on many plant species and environments and provide the demographic data and model structure in a data archive for future comparisons and meta-analyses. Invasive alien species are a social, economic, and ecological issue that has become increasingly important in an increasingly globalized world. Researchers continue to forecast impacts and prevent new introductions by seeking a robust understanding of drivers of invasive species success and failure. Researchers have hypothesized that competitive differences may play a key role in determining alien species success in novel environments. Studies that experimentally manipulate competitors while quantifying demography provide mechanistic insight into species' responses to competition. To date, nearly all field manipulations of competition that measure plant demography and population dynamics have focused on native plant species. The data we provide here aim to address this gap in our knowledge for alien plant species. We present raw data and population-projection models for 14 alien plant species in eastern Missouri, USA. We sampled under ambient conditions and with all individuals of nonfocal species removed from the community, allowing us to project population dynamics in the presence and absence of competition. We have also included the data quantifying how much biomass we removed at the plot level during each removal procedure and data from our germination experiment.

AB Herbivory and dispersal play roles in the coexistence of primary producers with shared resource limitation by imposing trade-offs either through apparent competition or dispersal limitation. These mechanisms of coexistence can further interact with meta-ecosystem effects, which results in spatial heterogeneity through the movement of herbivores and nutrients. Here, we investigate how herbivores influence autotroph coexistence through a meta-ecosystem effect, and how this effect couples mechanisms of coexistence to ecosystem structure and functioning. We articulate this framework through a parameterized one resource-k producer-one herbivore meta-ecosystem model. The results show that herbivore movement with nutrient recycling can generate spatial heterogeneity to allow coexistence where the well-mixed system predicts competitive exclusion. Furthermore, the presence of movement alters local and regional ecosystem functioning even when coexistence would occur without movement. These results highlight how meta-ecosystem theory can provide a mechanistic context for the observed complexity of biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships.

AB Herbivores may directly or indirectly affect plant attractiveness to pollinators. Although several studies have reported on these effects, there is yet no general consensus on the strength and sign of such interactions or their contingency on herbivory features such as the plant tissue attacked. We performed a meta-analysis of studies testing for effects of herbivores on floral traits, plant attractiveness to pollinators, and plant reproductive success. We also assessed whether herbivore effects depended on the plant tissue attacked by herbivores and if real or simulated herbivory was used. We found an overall significant negative effect of herbivores on floral traits, plant attractiveness to pollinators, and plant reproductive success. These effects were, however, contingent on the plant tissue attacked and on whether real or simulated damage was used. Real floral and leaf, but not root, herbivores showed detrimental effects on floral traits and plant attractiveness to pollinators. In addition, real leaf, but not floral or root herbivory, lowered plant reproductive success. Contrastingly, simulated leaf and floral herbivory showed no effect on any of the response variables. These findings help move forward our understanding of the strength and directionality of herbivore effects on plant attractiveness to pollinators and their underlying mechanisms.

AB Advances in species distribution modeling continue to be driven by a need to predict species responses to environmental change coupled with increasing data availability. Recent work has focused on development of methods that integrate multiple streams of data to model species distributions. Combining sources of information increases spatial coverage and can improve accuracy in estimates of species distributions. However, when fusing multiple streams of data, the temporal and spatial resolutions of data sources may be mismatched. This occurs when data sources have fluctuating geographic coverage, varying spatial scales and resolutions, and differing sources of bias and sparsity. It is well documented in the spatial statistics literature that ignoring the misalignment of different data sources will result in bias in both the point estimates and uncertainty. This will ultimately lead to inaccurate predictions of species distributions. Here, we examine the issue of misaligned data as it relates specifically to integrated species distribution models. We then provide a general solution that builds off work in the statistical literature for the change-of-support problem. Specifically, we leverage spatial correlation and repeat observations at multiple scales to make statistically valid predictions at the ecologically relevant scale of inference. An added feature of the approach is that addressing differences in spatial resolution between data sets can allow for the evaluation and calibration of lesser-quality sources in many instances. Using both simulations and data examples, we highlight the utility of this modeling approach and the consequences of not reconciling misaligned spatial data. We conclude with a brief discussion of the upcoming challenges and obstacles for species distribution modeling via data fusion.

AB Population dynamics models have long assumed that populations are composed of a restricted number of groups, where individuals in each group have identical demographic rates and where all groups are similarly affected by density-dependent and -independent effects. However, individuals usually vary tremendously in performance and in their sensitivity to environmental conditions or resource limitation, such that individual contributions to population growth will be highly variable. Recent efforts to integrate individual processes in population models open up new opportunities for the study of eco-evolutionary processes, such as the density-dependent influence of environmental conditions on the evolution of morphological, behavioral, and life-history traits. We review recent advances that demonstrate how including individual mechanisms in models of population dynamics contributes to a better understanding of the drivers of population dynamics within the framework of integrated population models (IPMs). IPMs allow for the integration in a single inferential framework of different data types as well as variable population structure including sex, social group, or territory, all of which can be formulated to include individual-level processes. Through a series of examples, we first show how IPMs can be beneficial for getting more accurate estimates of demographic traits than classic matrix population models by including basic population structure and their influence on population dynamics. Second, the integration of individual- and population-level data allows estimating density-dependent effects along with their inherent uncertainty by directly using the population structure and size to feedback on demography. Third, we show how IPMs can be used to study the influence of the dynamics of continuous individual traits and individual quality on population dynamics. We conclude by discussing the benefits and limitations of IPMs for integrating data at different spatial, temporal, and organismal levels to build more mechanistic models of population dynamics.

AB Scientists have long been trying to understand why the Neotropical region holds the highest diversity of birds on Earth. Recently, there has been increased interest in morphological variation between and within species, and in how climate, topography, and anthropogenic pressures may explain and affect phenotypic variation. Because morphological data are not always available for many species at the local or regional scale, we are limited in our understanding of intra- and interspecies spatial morphological variation. Here, we present the ATLANTIC BIRD TRAITS, a data set that includes measurements of up to 44 morphological traits in 67,197 bird records from 2,790 populations distributed throughout the Atlantic forests of South America. This data set comprises information, compiled over two centuries (1820-2018), for 711 bird species, which represent 80% of all known bird diversity in the Atlantic Forest. Among the most commonly reported traits are sex (n = 65,717), age (n = 63,852), body mass (n = 58,768), flight molt presence (n = 44,941), molt presence (n = 44,847), body molt presence (n = 44,606), tail length (n = 43,005), reproductive stage (n = 42,588), bill length (n = 37,409), body length (n = 28,394), right wing length (n = 21,950), tarsus length (n = 20,342), and wing length (n = 18,071). The most frequently recorded species are Chiroxiphia caudata (n = 1,837), Turdus albicollis (n = 1,658), Trichothraupis melanops (n = 1,468), Turdus leucomelas (n = 1,436), and Basileuterus culicivorus (n = 1,384). The species recorded in the greatest number of sampling localities are Basileuterus culicivorus (n = 243), Trichothraupis melanops (n = 242), Chiroxiphia caudata (n = 210), Platyrinchus mystaceus (n = 208), and Turdus rufiventris (n = 191). ATLANTIC BIRD TRAITS (ABT) is the most comprehensive data set on measurements of bird morphological traits found in a biodiversity hotspot; it provides data for basic and applied research at multiple scales, from individual to community, and from the local to the macroecological perspectives. No copyright or proprietary restrictions are associated with the use of this data set. Please cite this data paper when the data are used in publications or teaching and educational activities.

AB Extreme events significantly impact ecosystems and are predicted to increase in frequency and/or magnitude with climate change. Generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions describe most ecologically relevant extreme events, including hurricanes, wildfires, and disease spread. In climate science, the GEV is widely used as an accurate and flexible tool over large spatial scales (>10(5) km(2)) to study how changes in climate shift extreme events. However, ecologists rarely use the GEV to study how climate change affects populations. Here we show how to estimate a GEV for hurricanes at an ecologically relevant (<10(3) km(2)) spatial scale, and use the results in a stochastic, empirically based, matrix population model. As a case study, we use an understory shrub in southeast Florida, USA with hurricane-driven dynamics and measure the effects of change using the stochastic population growth rate. We use sensitivities to analyze how population growth rate is affected by changes in hurricane frequency and intensity, canopy damage levels, and canopy recovery rates. Our results emphasize the importance of accurately estimating location-specific storm frequency. In a rapidly changing world, our methods show how to combine realistic extreme event and population models to assess ecological impacts and to prioritize conservation actions for at-risk populations.

AB A common challenge for studying wildlife populations occurs when different survey methods provide inconsistent or incomplete inference on the trend, dynamics, or viability of a population. A potential solution to the challenge of conflicting or piecemeal data relies on the integration of multiple data types into a unified modeling framework, such as integrated population models (IPMs). IPMs are a powerful approach for species that inhabit spatially and seasonally complex environments. We provide guidance on exploiting the capabilities of IPMs to address inferential discrepancies that stem from spatiotemporal data mismatches. We illustrate this issue with analysis of a migratory species, the American Woodcock (Scolopax minor), in which individual monitoring programs suggest differing population trends. To address this discrepancy, we synthesized several long-term data sets (1963-2015) within an IPM to estimate continental-scale population trends, and link dynamic drivers across the full annual cycle and complete extent of the woodcock's geographic range in eastern North America. Our analysis reveals the limiting portions of the life cycle by identifying time periods and regions where vital rates are lowest and most variable, as well as which demographic parameters constitute the main drivers of population change. We conclude by providing recommendations for resolving conflicting population estimates within an integrated modeling approach, and discuss how strategies (e.g., data thinning, expert opinion elicitation) from other disciplines could be incorporated into ecological analyses when attempting to combine multiple, incongruent data types.

AB Climate models predict increases in drought conditions in many parts of the tropics. Yet the response of tropical forests to drought remains highly uncertain, especially with regards to the factors that generate spatial heterogeneity in drought response across landscapes. In this study, we used Landsat imagery to assess the impacts of a severe drought in 2015 across an 80,000-ha landscape in Puerto Rico. Specifically, we asked whether drought effects varied systematically with topography and with forest age, height, and fragmentation. We quantified drought impacts using anomalies of two vegetation indices, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI), and fit random forest models of these metrics including slope, aspect, forest age, canopy height, and two indices of fragmentation as predictors. Drought effects were more severe on drier topographic positions, that is, steeper slopes and southwest-facing aspects, and in second-growth forests. Shorter and more fragmented forests were also more strongly affected by drought. We also assessed which factors were associated with stronger recovery from drought. Factors associated with more negative drought anomalies were also associated with more positive postdrought anomalies, suggesting that increased light availability as a result of drought led to high rates of recovery in forests more severely affected by drought. In general, recovery from drought was rapid across the landscape, with postdrought anomalies at or above average across the study area. This suggests that forests in Puerto Rico might be resilient to a single-year drought, though vulnerability to drought varies depending on forest characteristics and landscape position.

AB Many tropical plants are defended by ants, and the costs and benefits of these mutualisms can vary across gradients of herbivory, soil fertility, latitude, and other environmental factors. Yet despite an abundant literature documenting thermal constraints on ant activity and behavior, we know little about whether temperature variation can influence the benefits conferred by ants to plants. We evaluated the effects of dawn-to-dusk fluctuations in temperature on patrolling and aggressive behavior in four arboreal ant mutualists of Acacia drepanolobium trees in central Kenya. We found that ant aggressive behavior significantly increased with branch surface temperature, primarily in the two most aggressive ant species: Crematogaster mimosae and C. nigriceps workers attacked a simulated herbivore at higher rates as surface temperature rose. In a browsing experiment, we found that goats browsed more frequently and for longer durations on C. mimosae-defended trees during cooler times of day, while goat browsing on plants from which ants had been removed was not affected by temperature. Our study demonstrates temperature-dependence in the efficacy of ant defense against herbivory and suggests that these ant-plants may be more vulnerable to herbivory during cooler hours of the day, when many native browsers are most active.

AB In dealing with predicted changes in environmental conditions outside those experienced today, forest managers and researchers rely on process-based models to inform physiological processes and predict future forest growth responses. The carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of tree-ring cellulose (delta C-13(cell), delta O-18(cell)) reveal long-term, integrated physiological responses to environmental conditions. We incorporated a submodel of delta O-18(cell) into the widely used Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth (3-PG) model for the first time, to complement a recently added delta C-13(cell) submodel. We parameterized the model using previously reported stand characteristics and long-term trajectories of tree-ring growth, delta C-13(cell), and delta O-18(cell) collected from the Metolius AmeriFlux site in central Oregon (upland trees). We then applied the parameterized model to a nearby set of riparian trees to investigate the physiological drivers of differences in observed basal area increment (BAI) and delta C-13(cell) trajectories between upland and riparian trees. The model showed that greater available soil water and maximum canopy conductance likely explain the greater observed BAI and lower delta C-13(cell) of riparian trees. Unexpectedly, both observed and simulated delta O-18(cell) trajectories did not differ between the upland and riparian trees, likely due to similar delta O-18 of source water isotope composition. The delta O-18(cell) submodel with a Peclet effect improved model estimates of delta O-18(cell) because its calculation utilizes 3-PG growth and allocation processes. Because simulated stand-level transpiration (E) is used in the delta O-18 submodel, aspects of leaf-level anatomy such as the effective path length for transport of water from the xylem to the sites of evaporation could be estimated.

AB Understanding how metapopulations persist in dynamic working landscapes requires assessing the behaviors of key actors that change patches as well as intrinsic factors driving turnover. Coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) research uses a multidisciplinary approach to identify the key actors, processes, and feedbacks that drive metapopulation and landscape dynamics. We describe a framework for modeling metapopulations in CHANS that integrates ecological and social data by coupling stochastic patch occupancy models of metapopulation dynamics with agent-based models of land-use change. We then apply this framework to metapopulations of the threatened black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis) and widespread Virginia rail (Rallus limicola) that inhabit patchy, irrigation-fed wetlands in the rangelands of the California Sierra Nevada foothills. We collected data from five diverse sources (rail occupancy surveys, land-use change mapping, a survey of landowner decision making, climate and reservoir databases, and mosquito trapping and West Nile virus testing) and integrated them into an agent-based stochastic patch occupancy model. We used the model to (1) quantify the drivers of metapopulation dynamics, and the potential interactions and feedbacks among them; (2) test predictions of the behavior of metapopulations in dynamic working landscapes; and (3) evaluate the impact of three policy options on metapopulation persistence (irrigation district water cutbacks during drought, incentives for landowners to create wetlands, and incentives for landowners to protect wetlands). Complex metapopulation dynamics emerged when landscapes functioned as CHANS, highlighting the importance of integrating human activities and other ecological processes into metapopulation models. Rail metapopulations were strongly top-down regulated by precipitation, and the black rail's decade-long decline was caused by the combination of West Nile virus and drought. Theoretical predictions of the two metapopulations' responses to dynamic landscapes and incentive programs were complicated by heterogeneity in patch quality and CHANS couplings, respectively. Irrigation cutbacks during drought posed a serious extinction risk that neither incentive policy effectively ameliorated.

AB The size of the terrestrial carbon (C) sink is mediated by the availability of nutrients that limit plant growth. However, nutrient controls on primary productivity are poorly understood in the geographically extensive yet understudied tropical dry forest biome. To examine how nutrients influence above- and belowground biomass production in a secondary, seasonally dry tropical forest, we conducted a replicated, fully factorial nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization experiment at the stand scale in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. The production of leaves, wood, and fine roots was monitored through time; root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi and the abundance of N-fixing root nodules were also quantified. In this seasonal forest, interannual variation in rainfall had the largest influence on stand-level productivity, with lower biomass growth under drought. By contrast, aboveground productivity was generally not increased by nutrient addition, although fertilization enhanced growth of individual tree stems in a wet year. However, root growth increased markedly and consistently under P addition, significantly altering patterns of stand-level biomass allocation to above- vs. belowground compartments. Although nutrients did not stimulate total biomass production at the community scale, N-fixing legumes exhibited a twofold increase in woody growth in response to added P, accompanied by a dramatic increase in the abundance of root nodules. These data suggest that the relationship between nutrient availability and primary production in tropical dry forest is contingent on both water availability and plant functional diversity.

AB Generalist predators are thought to be less vulnerable to habitat fragmentation because they use diverse resources across larger spatial scales than specialist predators. Thus, it has been suggested that generalist predators may respond positively to habitat edges or demonstrate no edge response, because they can potentially use prey resources equally well on both sides of the habitat edge. However, most predictions about generalist predator responses to the habitat edge are based solely on prey resources, without consideration of other potential drivers. For instance, structural resources are essential for some species to build webs to capture prey or to avoid intraguild predation and cannibalism. In this study, we used both prey and structural resources to predict the response of four predator functional groups (hunting spiders, web-building spiders, aerial predators, and epigeic predators that feed on the detrital/algal food web) to a habitat edge between two salt-marsh grasses (Spartina alterniflora and Spartina patens). We found that generalist predators largely demonstrated negative responses to the habitat edge and had distinct habitat associations. Positive edge responses were only observed in one functional group (hunting spiders), and this pattern was driven by the two most abundant species. Negative responses to the habitat edge were more common among taxa and were better explained by structural resources rather than prey resources in the two habitats. Although it is generally acknowledged that specialists decline in fragmented habitats, generalists are thought to be more resilient. However, our research demonstrates that even generalists have habitat structural or food resource requirements that may limit their resilience to habitat loss and fragmentation.

AB Many species of bumble bee (Bombus) have declined in range and abundance across Europe, the Americas, and Asia, whereas other species have persisted and remain common and widespread. One explanation as to why some species have declined, based primarily on studies of the European bumble bee fauna, is that declining species have relatively narrow pollen-foraging niches and are less able to use alternative host plants in the absence of their preferred hosts. Though extensively explored in Europe, this hypothesis has not been investigated in North America, in part due to incomplete information on the foraging niche of many species. We selected 12 bumble bee species found in Michigan and quantified their pollen diets using museum specimens. We also extensively resurveyed the state to understand their contemporary status and distribution. Compared to a pre-2000 baseline, six species remain relatively common and widespread, whereas six species show range contractions of over 50%. There was a significant relationship between dietary breadth and distributional range change, with declined or declining species collecting around one-third fewer pollen types than stable species. Though there were significant compositional differences, we found no differences in the number of pollen types collected by species with differing tongue lengths. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that species with narrower dietary niches are at greater risk of decline. However, it is not clear if narrow dietary niches are a cause of declines, or if both are driven by an underlying factor such as proximity to the edge of climatic niches. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of dietary niche in bumble bees, and how it interacts with other factors to influence population trajectories of stable and at-risk species.

AB Occupancy models are widely applied to estimate species distributions, but few methods exist for model checking. Thorough model assessments can uncover inadequacies and allow for deeper ecological insight by exploring structure in the observed data not accounted for by a model. We introduce occupancy model residual definitions that utilize the posterior distribution of the partially latent occupancy states. Residual-based assessments are valuable because they can target specific assumptions and identify ways to improve a model, such as adding spatial correlation or meaningful covariates. Our approach defines separate residuals for occupancy and detection, and we use simulation to examine whether missing structure for modeling detection probabilities can be distinguished from that for occupancy probabilities. In many scenarios, our residual diagnostics were able to separate inadequacies at the different model levels successfully, but we describe other situations when this may not be the case. Applying Moran's I residual diagnostics to assess models for silver-haired (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and little brown (Myotis lucifugus) bats only provided evidence of residual spatial correlation among detections. Targeting specific model assumptions using carefully chosen residual diagnostics is valuable for any analysis, and we remove previous barriers for occupancy analyses-lack of examples and practical advice.

AB Although many studies have investigated plant growth in the context of episodic herbivory and pressed resource availability, relatively few have examined how plant growth is affected by pulsed resources and chronic herbivory. Periodical cicada (Magicicada spp.) adults represent a pulsed detrital subsidy that fertilizes plants, and live cicada nymphs are long-lived root-feeding herbivores. Previous studies of cicada herbivory effects have been inconclusive, and previous studies of cicada-mediated fertilization did not examine effects on trees, or on a multiyear timescale. Here, we describe the results of a 3-yr experiment that factorially manipulated the presence and absence of cicada fertilization and herbivory in a population of 100 American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) trees. We found that cicada fertilization strongly increased tree growth in the year of emergence, creating differences in tree size that persisted at least 2 yr later. By comparison, we did not detect reductions in tree growth associated with cicada herbivory in any year of this experiment. However, cicada herbivory reduced the densities of, and damage from, other aboveground herbivores. These results suggest that cicadas affect the size structure of forests over multiple years, and raise questions about how cicada-mediated fertilization and herbivory will affect tree growth over longer timescales.

AB Ultraviolet (UV) radiation intensities differ among global regions, with significantly higher levels in the southern hemisphere. UV-B may act as an environmental filter during plant invasions, which might particularly apply to plant species from Europe introduced to New Zealand. Just like for any other abiotic or biotic filter, successful invaders can cope with novel environmental conditions via plastic responses and/or through rapid adaptation by natural selection in the exotic range. We conducted a multispecies experiment with herbaceous plants in two common gardens located in the species' native and exotic ranges, in Germany and New Zealand, respectively. We used plants of German and New Zealand origin of eight species to test for adaptation to higher UV-B radiation in their new range. In each common garden, all plants were exposed to three radiation treatments: (1) ambient sunlight, (2) exclusion of UV-B while transmitting ambient UV-A, and (3) combined exclusion of UV-B and UVA. Linear mixed-effect models revealed significant effects of UV-B on growth and leaf traits and an indication for UV-B-induced biomass reduction in both common gardens pointing to an impact of natural, ambient UV radiation intensities experienced by plants in the northern and in the southern hemisphere. In both common gardens, the respective local plants (i.e., German origins in Germany, New Zealand origins in New Zealand) displayed enhanced productivity and aboveground biomass allocation, thus providing evidence for recent evolutionary processes in the exotic range. Genetic differentiation between different origins in consequence of divergent local selection pressures was found for specific leaf area. This differentiation particularly hints at different selective forces in both ranges while only little evidence was found for an immediate selective effect of high UV-B intensities in the exotic range. However, reaction norm slopes across ranges revealed higher plasticity of exotic individuals in functional leaf traits that might allow for a more sensitive regulation of photoprotection measures in response to UV-B. During the colonization, New Zealand populations might have been selected for the observed higher phenotypic plasticity and a consequently increased ability to successfully spread in the exotic range.

AB We monitored a close-spaced grid of 289 seed traps in 1.44 ha for 8.4 yr in an Amazonian floodplain forest. In a tree community containing hundreds of species, a median of just three to four species of tree seeds falls annually into each 0.5-m(2) establishment site. The number of seed species reaching a given site increased linearly with time for the duration of the monitoring period, indicating a roughly random arrival of seed species in a given site-year. The number of seed species captured each year over the entire grid ranged from one-third to one-half of the total captured over the 8.4 yr of monitoring, revealing a substantial temporal component of variation in the seed rain. Seed rain at the 0.5-m(2) scale displayed extreme spatial variability when all potentially viable seeds were tallied, whereas the rain of dispersed seeds was scant, more nearly uniform, and better mixed. Dispersal limitation, defined as failure of seeds to reach establishment sites, is >= 99% per year for a majority of species, explaining why seed augmentation experiments are often successful. Dispersal limitation has been evoked as an explanation for distance-dependent species turnover in tropical tree communities, but that interpretation contrasts with the fact that many Amazonian tree species possess large geographical ranges that extend for hundreds or thousands of kilometers. A better understanding of the processes that bridge the gap between the scales of seedling establishment and the regulation of forest composition will require new methodologies for studying dispersal on scales larger than those yet achieved.

   CONSEQUENCES
AB Identifying and quantifying the mechanisms influencing species coexistence remains a major challenge for the study of community ecology. These mechanisms, which stem from species' differential responses to competition and their environments, promote coexistence if they give each species a growth advantage when rare. Yet despite the widespread assumption that co-occurring species stably coexist, there have been few empirical demonstrations in support of this claim. Likewise, coexistence is often assumed to result from interspecific differences in life-history traits, but the relative contributions of these trait differences to coexistence are rarely quantified, particularly across environmental gradients. Using two widely co-occurring and ecologically similar species of freshwater duckweed plants (Spirodela polyrhiza and Lemna minor), we tested hypotheses that interspecific differences in facultative dormancy behaviors, thermal reaction norms, and density-dependent growth promote coexistence between these species, and that their relative influences on coexistence change as average temperatures and fluctuations around them vary. In competition experiments, we found strong evidence for negative frequency-dependent growth across a range of both static and fluctuating temperatures, suggesting a critical role of fluctuation-independent stabilization in coexistence. This negative frequency dependence could be explained by our observation that for both species, intraspecific competition was over 1.5 times stronger than interspecific competition, granting each species a low-density growth advantage. Using an empirically parameterized competition model, we found that while coexistence was facilitated by environmental fluctuations, fluctuation-independent stabilization via negative frequency dependence was crucial for coexistence. Conversely, the temporal storage effect, an important fluctuation-dependent mechanism, was relatively weak in comparison. Contrary to expectations, differences in the species' thermal reaction norms and dormancy behaviors did not significantly promote coexistence in fluctuating environments. Our results highlight how coexistence in two ubiquitous and ostensibly similar aquatic plants is not necessarily a product of their most obvious interspecific differences, and instead results from subtle niche differences causing negative frequency-dependent growth, which acts consistently on both species across environmental gradients.

AB Plankton live under the countervailing selective pressures of predation and ultraviolet radiation (UVR). In lakes, zooplankton are transparent reducing visibility to predatory fishes but are pigmented in the absence of fishes, hypothetically reducing UVR damage. In the sea, planktivorous fishes are widespread, so plankton typically are transparent and ascend to productive surface waters at night to forage and descend during the day to reduce visibility to predators. However, larvae of some species face the unique constraint of traveling in surface currents in the daytime during migrations between adult and larval habitats. We would expect these larvae to be transparent since companion studies demonstrated increased predation risk of pigmented larvae under strong sunlight. Paradoxically, larvae range from being darkly to lightly pigmented. We hypothesize that some larvae are more heavily pigmented to reduce UVR damage, while other species travelling in subsurface currents with low UVR might be more transparent. Linking larval morphology to depth-dependent selective pressures would add a key element to help improve predictions of larval vertical distributions, which are important for simulating larval transport trajectories. We quantitatively tested the hypothesis that selection may have favored photoprotective pigmentation for larvae in the predominantly transparent plankton community while testing the differential effects of UVA and UVB radiation. We measured larval pigmentation of 12 species of crabs and exposed them to visible light only, visible + UVA, or visible + UVA + UVB in the tropics. Controlling for phylogeny, more pigmented species survived UVR better than less pigmented species, especially on sunnier days, though intraspecific comparisons for four species were equivocal. Most species died even from UVA exposure, which has long been regarded as relatively harmless despite penetrating deeper underwater than UVB. Thus, we demonstrate with a phylogenetically controlled analysis that crab larvae are pigmented in the predominantly transparent planktonic community to protect from UVR, improving our understanding of the selective forces acting on animal coloration and the factors determining planktonic distributions, survival, and dispersal. This linkage of morphology with susceptibility will be important for developing mechanistic models of environmental stress responses to better predict larval dispersal in current and future climates.

AB The expansion of shrubs and trees across high-latitude ecosystems is one of the most dramatic ecological manifestations of climate change. Most of the work quantifying these changes has been done in small areas and over relatively recent time scales. These land-cover transitions are highly spatially variable, and we have limited understanding of the factors underlying this variation. We use repeat photography to generate a data set of land-cover changes in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska, stretching back a century and spanning a range of edaphic, topographic, and climatic conditions. Most land-cover classes were quite stable, with low probabilities of transitioning to other land-cover types. The advance of woody vegetation into low-stature tundra, and the spread of conifer trees into shrub-dominated areas, were both more likely at low elevations and in areas without permafrost. Permafrost also reduced the likelihood of herbaceous vegetation transitioning to woody cover. Exceptions to the general trend of relative stability included nearly all (96%) of the broadleaf forest-dominated areas being invaded by conifers, an expected successional trajectory, and many open gravel river bars (17.8%) transitioning to thick shrubs. These floodplain areas were distinctly not at equilibrium, as only 0.1% of shrub-dominated areas converted to gravel. Warming temperatures in coming decades and concomitant declines in the extent of permafrost are predicted to enhance the spread of woody vegetation in Denali further, but only by similar to 3%. Land-cover transitions, notably the rapid advance of trees and shrubs observed in other studies, could be less likely and more spatially heterogeneous here than in other high-latitude systems.

AB Numerous biotic mechanisms can control ecosystem nutrient cycling, but their full incorporation into ecological models or experimental designs can result in inordinate complexity. Including organismal nutrient limitation in models of highly dimensional systems (i.e., those with many nutrient pools/species) presents a critical challenge. We evaluate the importance of explicitly considering microbial and animal nutrient limitation to predict ecosystem nitrogen cycling across plant-based and detritus-based food chains. We investigate how eight factorial scenarios of microbial, herbivore, and microbi-detritivore (i.e., omnivores consuming microbes and detritus) nitrogen or carbon limitation alter the stocks and flows of nitrogen in an ecosystem model. We used a combination of partial derivatives of model equilibrium solutions and numerical simulations using randomly drawn parameter sets to explore the impact of each nutrient limitation scenario on nutrient stocks and flows. We show that switching microbes, herbivores, or microbi-detritivores from nitrogen to carbon limitation consistently altered the ecosystem response to changes in inorganic nitrogen supply, plant C:N ratio, and microbial C:N ratio. Organism nutrient limitation changed ecosystem nitrogen flows by altering the feedbacks between the abiotic and biotic pools. For example, microbi-detritivore nutrient limitation determined whether the microbial response to changes in inorganic nitrogen supply and C:N ratios was dependent on the size of detrital carbon or detrital nitrogen pool. Such correlated responses among biotic and abiotic pools set up a network of predictable changes in ecosystem properties sensitive to organism nutrient limitation. Scenarios with microbial limitation were generally sufficient to capture the suite of ecosystem responses to increasing inorganic nitrogen supply, while scenarios with animal limitation added new behavior whenever C:N ratios changed. We make the case for explicitly considering both microbial and animal nutrient limitation when predicting the flow and distribution of nitrogen across green and brown food chains.

AB The isotopic composition (ic) of soil nitrogen (N) and, more recently, the intramolecular distribution of N-15 in the N2O molecule (site preference, SP) are powerful instruments to identify dominant N turnover processes, and to attribute N2O emissions to their source processes. Despite the process information contained in the ic of N species and the associated potential for model validation, the implementation of isotopes in ecosystem models has lagged behind. To foster the validation of ecosystem models based on the ic of N species, we developed the stable isotope model for nutrient cycles (SIMONE). SIMONE uses fluxes between ecosystem N pools (soil organic N, mineral N, plants, microbes) calculated by biogeochemical models, and literature isotope effects for these processes to calculate the ic of N species. Here, we present the concept of SIMONE, apply it to simulations of the biogeochemical model LandscapeDNDC, and assess the capability of N-15-N2O and, to our knowledge for the first time, SP, to constrain simulated N fluxes by LandscapeDNDC. LandscapeDNDC successfully simulated N2O emission, soil nitrate, and ammonium, as well as soil environmental conditions of an intensively managed grassland site in Switzerland. Accordingly, the dynamics of N-15-N2O and SP of soil N2O fluxes as simulated by SIMONE agreed well with measurements, though N-15-N2O was on average underestimated and SP overestimated (root-mean-square error [RMSE] of 8.4& and 7.3&, respectively). Although N-15-N2O could not constrain the N cycling process descriptions of LandscapeDNDC, the overestimation of SP indicated an overestimation of simulated nitrification rates by 10-59% at low water content, suggesting the revision of the corresponding model parameterization. Our findings show that N isotope modeling in combination with only recently available high-frequency measurements of the N2O ic are promising tools to identify and address weaknesses in N cycling of ecosystem models. This will finally contribute to augmenting the development of model-based strategies for mitigating N pollution.

AB Disease dynamics are governed by variation of individuals, species, and environmental conditions across space and time. In some cases, an alternate reservoir host amplifies pathogen loads and drives disease transmission to less competent hosts in a process called pathogen spillover. Spillover is frequently associated with multi-host disease systems where a single species is more tolerant of infection and more competent in pathogen transmission compared to other hosts. Pathogen spillover must be driven by biotic factors, including host and community characteristics, yet biotic factors interact with the abiotic environment (e.g., temperature) to create disease. Despite its fundamental role in disease dynamics, the influence of the abiotic environment on pathogen spillover has seldom been examined. Improving our understanding of disease processes such as pathogen spillover hinges on disentangling the effects of interrelated biotic and abiotic factors over space and time. We applied 10 yr of fine-scale microclimate, disease, and tree community data in a path analysis to investigate the relative influence of biotic and abiotic factors on pathogen spillover for the emerging infectious forest disease sudden oak death (SOD). Disease transmission in SOD is primarily driven by the reservoir host California bay laurel, which supports high foliar pathogen loads that spillover onto neighboring oak trees and create lethal canker infections. The foliar pathogen load and susceptibility of oaks is expected to be sensitive to forest microclimate conditions. We found that biotic factors of pathogen load and tree diversity had relatively stronger effects on pathogen spillover compared to abiotic microclimate factors, with pathogen load increasing oak infection and tree diversity reducing oak infection. Abiotic factors still had significant effects, with greater heat exposure during summer months reducing pathogen loads and optimal pathogen conditions during the wet season increasing oak infection. Our results offer clues to possible disease dynamics under future climate change where hotter and drier or warmer and wetter conditions could have opposing effects on pathogen spillover in the SOD system. Disentangling direct and indirect effects of biotic and abiotic factors affecting disease processes can provide key insights into disease dynamics including potential avenues for reducing disease spread and predicting future epidemics.

AB Predicting the long-term consequences of habitat alteration for the preservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function requires an understanding of how ecological filters drive taxonomic and functional biodiversity loss. Here, we test a set of predictions concerning the role of ecological filters in restructuring native bee assemblages inhabiting fragmented coastal sage scrub ecosystems in southern California, USA. In 2011 and 2012, we collected native bees in scrub habitat belonging to two treatment categories: large natural reserves and small habitat fragments embedded in an urban landscape. We compared bee assemblages in reserve and fragment sites with respect to their taxonomic and functional alpha diversity, beta diversity, assemblage composition, and mean geographical range size estimated via distribution maps compiled for this study from digitized specimen records. We found multiple lines of evidence that ecological filtering drove bee diversity loss in fragments: a disproportionate loss of functional diversity relative to taxonomic diversity, shifts in assemblage composition driven largely by the preferential extirpation of reserve-associated indicator species, and disproportionate loss of range-restricted species. However, we found no evidence of taxonomic or functional homogenization across fragment bee assemblages, suggesting that filtering was not sufficiently strong to cause a subset of functional traits (and their associated species) to dominate assemblages in fragments. Our results suggest that ecological filtering altered bee assemblages in habitat fragments, even when such fragments contained well-preserved native plant assemblages, underscoring the importance of preserving large areas of natural habitat for the conservation of bees (especially range-restricted taxa) and their associated ecological functions.

AB Developing a holistic understanding of the ecosystem impacts of global change requires methods that can quantify the interactions among multiple response variables. One approach is to generate high dimensional spaces, or hypervolumes, to answer ecological questions in a multivariate context. A range of statistical methods has been applied to construct hypervolumes but have not yet been applied in the context of ecological data sets with spatial or temporal structure, for example, where the data are nested or demonstrate temporal autocorrelation. We outline an approach to account for data structure in quantifying hypervolumes based on the multivariate normal distribution by including random effects. Using simulated data, we show that failing to account for structure in data can lead to biased estimates of hypervolume properties in certain contexts. We then illustrate the utility of these "model-based hypervolumes" in providing new insights into a case study of afforestation effects on ecosystem properties where the data has a nested structure. We demonstrate that the model-based generalization allows hypervolumes to be applied to a wide range of ecological data sets and questions.

AB Invasive nonindigenous species are defined by their impacts: they substantially change native communities or ecosystems. Accordingly, invasive species might transform their habitats in ways that eventually become unfavorable to them, causing population declines or even extirpations. Here we use over 40 yr of systematically collected data on the abundance of the invasive rusty crayfish Faxonius rusticus from 17 lakes in northern Wisconsin, USA to explore whether population declines of this invader are related to the prevalence of rocky habitat, which shelters crayfish from predators and is unchanged by crayfish. We predicted that lakes with rock-dominated substrates would be resistant to F. rusticus population declines, whereas lakes lacking rock-dominated substrates would experience F. rusticus declines due to crayfish destruction of shelter-providing macrophytes. We found that in nearly one-half (47%) of the study lakes, F. rusticus experienced population declines over the study time period, and these lakes had significantly lower proportions of rock substrate than lakes that did not experience population declines. We recommend that more studies should investigate the potential for invasive species-mediated community or ecosystem feedbacks to eventually contribute to their own population declines.

AB Populations optimize the match of phenotype to environment by localized natural selection, adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and habitat choice. Habitat choice may also be achieved by several mechanisms, including matching habitat choice, where individuals distribute themselves based on self-assessment of the phenotype-environment match. Matching habitat choice is a relatively untested concept, but one that could advance our understanding of the interplay of movement ecology and intraspecific phenotypic variation. Morphology of the salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus differs in riffles and pools, the dominant habitats in headwater streams where this species occurs. Specifically, individuals found in riffles have shorter limbs than those found in pools. Here, we used 4 yr of spatially explicit capture-mark-recapture data from three streams to test the contributions of phenotypic plasticity and matching habitat choice to this phenotype-environment covariation. We quantified morphological variation in G. porphyriticus with size-corrected principal component (PC) scores and assessed phenotype-environment match based on the difference between habitats in these PC scores. We found that both phenotypic plasticity and matching habitat choice contribute to phenotype-environment covariation in G. porphyriticus. The phenotypes of individuals that switched habitats (i.e., riffle? pool, pool? riffle) changed to become better matched to the recipient habitat, indicating a plastic response to local habitat conditions. Consistent with matching habitat choice, individuals were also more likely to switch habitats if their initial phenotype was a better match to the alternative habitat, independent of subsequent changes in morphology due to plasticity. Realized performance, survival adjusted for the likelihood of remaining in each habitat, was higher in individuals with phenotypes matched to each habitat than in those with mismatched phenotypes, but performance was generally lower in riffles than pools, suggesting that other factors influence the use of riffles. Our results underscore the value of considering how matching habitat choice interacts with other mechanisms that allow organisms to maximize performance when faced with environmental heterogeneity. More broadly, our study shows that it is important to account for movement in any study of the causes or consequences of intraspecific trait variation, a challenge that may require novel research approaches and experimental designs.

AB Recent studies have shown that complex species interactions can regulate above- and belowground processes in terrestrial systems. Ungulate herbivory and invasive species are known to have strong effects on plant communities in some systems, but their impacts on soil biota and belowground processes are lesser known. Growing evidence suggests white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and invasive plants facilitate increased abundance of exotic earthworms in temperate forests of the eastern United States. We conducted an experimental study that manipulated deer access and the presence of an invasive understory shrub in an eastern deciduous forest of southwestern Ohio, USA, from 2013 to 2017. Earthworm density and biomass, and standing litter biomass were measured in five paired deer access and exclosure plots, each with a split-plot removal of Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). Earthworm density declined in response to the experimental exclusion of deer, with earthworm density decreasing over time in the deer exclosure plots relative to deer access plots. Deer exclusion produced greater variation in earthworm species composition relative to access plots. Multivariate analyses indicated that larger earthworms in the genus Lumbricus were associated with deer exclosure plots, while smaller endogeic species were ubiquitous in both treatments. Standing litter biomass decreased over time in the deer-access plots. In contrast, honeysuckle removal had little effect on earthworm density and standing litter biomass. There was an interaction between deer and honeysuckle treatments on earthworm biomass, with honeysuckle removal reducing earthworm biomass when deer were excluded. Our results demonstrate strong effects of herbivores on invasive earthworms and ecosystem processes, but indicate a weaker influence of invasive shrubs. Further, our findings suggest that the effects of deer overabundance in forest ecosystems are potentially reversible with long-term intervention.

AB Species traits provide a strong link between an organism's fitness and processes at community and ecosystem levels. However, such data remain scarce for amphibians in the Neotropics. Colombia is the country with the highest number of threatened amphibians and the second greatest number of amphibian species worldwide. We present a data set containing eight morphological traits for 4,623 museum specimens of the seven largest collections in the country corresponding to 293 species of 14 families. The number of measured specimens per species ranged from 1 to 118 individuals with a median of 8 individuals per species. Overall, this database gathered morphological information for 37.6% of Colombian anuran diversity. Species measured were mainly distributed in the high Andean forest, the paramo, and wetland ecosystems, and was part of a national initiative led by the Instituto Alexander von Humboldt. The morphological traits were selected on the basis of their role in species' responses to environmental variability and their contributions to ecosystem processes. These traits were related to habitat use, (forearm length, tibia length, femur length, foot length, and foot webbing), predation and food chains (head width and mouth width), and nutrient recycling (snout-vent length). We expect this data set will be used in studies on functional diversity in amphibians and the development of conservation planning for these taxa. No copyright or proprietary restrictions are associated with the use of this data set other than citation of this Data Paper.

AB Every living creature on Earth is made of atoms of the various bioelements that are harnessed in the construction of molecules, tissues, organisms, and communities, as we know them. Organisms need these bioelements in specific quantities and proportions to survive and grow. Distinct species have different functions and life strategies, and have therefore developed distinct structures and adopted a certain combination of metabolic and physiological processes. Each species is thus also expected to have different requirements for each bioelement. We therefore propose that a "biogeochemical niche" can be associated with the classical ecological niche of each species. We show from field data examples that a biogeochemical niche is characterized by a particular elementome defined as the content of all (or at least most) bioelements. The differences in elementome among species are a function of taxonomy and phylogenetic distance, sympatry (the bioelemental compositions should differ more among coexisting than among non-coexisting species to avoid competitive pressure), and homeostasis with a continuum between high homeostasis/low plasticity and low homeostasis/high plasticity. This proposed biogeochemical niche hypothesis has the advantage relative to other associated theoretical niche hypotheses that it can be easily characterized by actual quantification of a measurable trait: the elementome of a given organism or a community, being potentially applicable across taxa and habitats. The changes in bioelemental availability can determine genotypic selection and therefore have a feedback on ecosystem function and organization, and, at the end, become another driving factor of the evolution of life and the environment.

AB Predators exert a strong influence on ecological communities by reducing the abundance of prey (consumptive effects) and shaping their foraging behavior (non-consumptive effects). Although the prevalence of trophic cascades triggered by non-consumptive effects is increasingly recognized in a wide range of ecosystems, how its relative strength changes as prey individuals grow in size along various life stages remains poorly resolved. We investigated how the effects of predators vary with the ontogeny of a key herbivorous sea urchin, which is responsible for transforming diverse macroalgal forests to a barren state dominated by bare rock and encrusting coralline algae. We conducted a series of field and laboratory experiments to determine how susceptibility to predation, prey behavioral responses, and grazing impact on algal cover vary with sea urchin size. The consumptive effects of predators were greater on smaller sea urchin size classes, which were more susceptible to predation. Unexpectedly however, predator non-consumptive effects acted only on larger sea urchins, significantly reducing their grazing activity in the presence of predator cues. Crucially, only these larger sea urchins were capable of overgrazing macroalgae in the field, with non-consumptive effects reducing sea urchin foraging activity and macroalgal grazing impact by 60%. The decoupling between risk and fear as prey grow indicates that the strength of consumptive and non-consumptive trophic cascades may act differently at different ontogenetic stages of prey. While the consumptive effects of predators directly influence population numbers, the consequences of non-consumptive effects may far outlive consumptive effects as prey grow, finding refuge in size, but not from fear.

AB Biomass removal by herbivores usually incurs a fitness cost for the attacked plants, with the total cost per unit lost tissue depending on the value of the removed tissue (i.e., how costly it is to be replaced by regrowth). Optimal defense theory, first outlined in the 1960s and 1970s, predicted that these fitness costs result in an arms race between plants and herbivores, in which selection favors resistance strategies that either repel herbivores through morphological and chemical resistance traits in order to reduce their consumption, or result in enemy escape through rapid growth or by timing the growth or flowering to the periods when herbivores are absent. Such resistance against herbivores would most likely evolve when herbivores are abundant, cause extensive damage, and consume valuable plant tissues. The purpose of this Special Feature is to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the phenomenon of overcompensation, specifically, where the finding has brought us and where it is leading us 30 yr later. We first provide a short overview of how the phenomenon of overcompensation has led to broader studies on plant tolerance to herbivory, summarize key findings, and then discuss some promising new directions in light of six featured research papers.

AB The seasonal growth advantage hypothesis posits that plant species that grow well during seasonal drought will increase in abundance in forests with increasing seasonality of rainfall both in absolute numbers and also relative to co-occurring plant species that grow poorly during seasonal drought. That is, seasonal drought will give some plant species a growth advantage that they lack in aseasonal forests, thus allowing them attain higher abundance. For tropical forest plants, the seasonal growth advantage hypothesis may explain the distribution of drought-adapted species across large-scale gradients of rainfall and seasonality. We tested the seasonal growth advantage hypothesis with lianas and trees in a seasonal tropical forest in central Panama. We measured the dry-season and wet-season diameter growth of 1,117 canopy trees and 648 canopy lianas from 2011 to 2016. We also evaluated how lianas and trees responded to the 2015-2016 El Nino, which was the third strongest el Nino drought on record in Panama. We found that liana growth rate was considerably higher during the dry-season months than the wet-season months in each of the five years. Lianas achieved one-half of their annual growth during the 4-month dry season. By contrast, trees grew far more during the wet season; they realized only one-quarter of their annual growth during the dry season. During the strong 2015-2016 El Nino dry season, trees essentially stopped growing, whereas lianas grew unimpeded and as well as during any of the previous four dry seasons. Our findings support the hypothesis that seasonal growth gives lianas a decided growth advantage over trees in seasonal forests compared to aseasonal forests, and may explain why lianas peak in both absolute and relative abundance in highly seasonal tropical forests. Furthermore, the ability of lianas to grow during a strong el Nino drought suggests that lianas will benefit from the predicted increasing drought severity, whereas trees will suffer, and thus lianas are predicted to increase in relative abundance in seasonal tropical forests.

AB Hydraulic traits are important for woody plant functioning and distribution. Associations among hydraulic traits, other leaf and stem traits, and species' performance are relatively well understood for trees, but remain poorly studied for lianas. We evaluated the coordination among hydraulic efficiency (i.e., maximum hydraulic conductivity), hydraulic safety (i.e., cavitation resistance), a suite of eight morphological and physiological traits, and species' abundances for saplings of 24 liana species and 27 tree species in wet tropical forests in Panama. Trees showed a strong trade-off between hydraulic efficiency and hydraulic safety, whereas efficiency and safety were decoupled in lianas. Hydraulic efficiency was strongly and similarly correlated with acquisitive traits for lianas and trees (e.g., positively with gas exchange rates and negatively with wood density). Hydraulic safety, however, showed no correlations with other traits in lianas, but with several in trees (e.g., positively with leaf dry matter content and wood density and negatively with gas exchange rates), indicating that in lianas hydraulic efficiency is an anchor trait because it is correlated with many other traits, while in trees both efficiency and safety are anchor traits. Traits related to shade tolerance (e.g., low specific leaf area and high wood density) were associated with high local tree sapling abundance, but not with liana abundance. Our results suggest that different, yet unknown mechanisms determine hydraulic safety and local-scale abundance for lianas compared to trees. For trees, the trade-off between efficiency and safety will provide less possibilities for ecological strategies. For lianas, however, the uncoupling of efficiency and safety could allow them to have high hydraulic efficiency, and hence high growth rates, without compromising resistance to cavitation under drought, thus allowing them to thrive and outperform trees under drier conditions.

AB The impact of ecological light pollution involves alteration of periods of natural light, a fact that has proven effects on ecosystems. Few studies have focused on the impact of this pollution on wild plant species, and none on coastal dune plants. Many coastal dunes and their plants are adjacent to tourist areas, and these might be affected by light pollution. Such is the case of the Natural Reserve Dunas de Maspalomas (Gran Canaria), where some individuals of the plant species Traganum moquinii, located in the El Ingles beach foredune zone, are affected by light pollution. This study examines the effect of light pollution on the flowering process and, by extension, the reproductive cycle of these plants. Plants located closer to high artificial illumination sources receive similar to 2,120 h/yr of intense light more than plants located furthest from those artificial lighting sources. Parts of the plants of Traganum moquinii exposed directly to the artificial light show a significant decrease in the production of flowers, compared to the parts in plants in shade, and to the plants more distant from artificial lights. In consequence, plants exposed more directly to artificial light have a lower potential for seed reproduction. The spectrum of artificial light also affects the plants, and light between 600 and 700 nm primarily affects the reproductive cycle of the Traganum moquinii species. The implications for the ecological and geomorphological functioning of the dune system are discussed, because this species plays a decisive role in the formation of foredune zones and nebkhas in arid dune systems.

AB Saltwater intrusion and salinization of coastal wetlands around the world are becoming a pressing issue due to sea level rise. Here, we assessed how a freshwater coastal wetland ecosystem responds to saltwater intrusion. In wetland mesocosms, we continuously exposed Cladium jamaicense Crantz (sawgrass) plants and their peat soil collected from a freshwater marsh to two factors associated with saltwater intrusion in karstic ecosystems: elevated loading of salinity and phosphorus (P) inputs. We took repeated measures using a 2 9 2 factorial experimental design (n = 6) with treatments composed of elevated salinity (similar to 9 ppt), P loading (14.66 mu mol P/d), or a combination of both. We measured changes in water physicochemistry, ecosystem productivity, and plant biomass change over two years to assess monthly and two-year responses to saltwater intrusion. In the short-term, plants exhibited positive growth responses with simulated saltwater intrusion (salinity + P), driven by increased P availability. Despite relatively high salinity levels for a freshwater marsh (similar to 9 ppt), gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), net ecosystem productivity (NEP), and aboveground biomass were significantly higher in the elevated salinity + P treated monoliths compared to the freshwater controls. Salinity stress became evident after extended exposure. Although still higher than freshwater controls, GEP and NEP were significantly lower in the elevated salinity + P treatment than the + P treatment after two years. However, elevated salinity decreased live root biomass regardless of whether P was added. Our results suggest that saltwater intrusion into karstic freshwater wetlands may initially act as a subsidy by stimulating aboveground primary productivity of marsh plants. However, chronic exposure to elevated salinity results in plant stress, negatively impacting belowground peat soil structure and stability through a reduction in plant roots.

AB Forests play a key role in regulating the global carbon cycle, and yet the abiotic and biotic conditions that drive the demographic processes that underpin forest carbon dynamics remain poorly understood in natural ecosystems. To address this knowledge gap, we used repeat forest inventory data from 92,285 trees across four large permanent plots (4-25 ha in size) in temperate mixed forests in northeast China to ask the following questions: (1) How do soil conditions and stand age drive biomass demographic processes? (2) How do vegetation quality (i.e., functional trait diversity and composition) and quantity (i.e., initial biomass stocks) influence biomass demographic processes independently from soil conditions and stand age? (3) What is the relative contribution of growth, recruitment, and mortality to net biomass change? Using structural equation modeling, we showed that all three demographic processes were jointly constrained by multiple abiotic and biotic factors and that mortality was the strongest determinant on net biomass change over time. Growth and mortality, as well as functional trait diversity and the community-weighted mean of specific leaf area (CWMSLA), declined with stand age. By contrast, high soil phosphorous concentrations were associated with greater functional diversity and faster dynamics (i.e., high growth and mortality rates), but associated with lower CWMSLA and initial biomass stock. More functionally diverse communities also had higher recruitment rates, but did not exhibit faster growth and mortality. Instead, initial biomass stocks and CWMSLA were stronger predictors of biomass growth and mortality, respectively. By integrating the full spectrum of abiotic and biotic drivers of forest biomass dynamics, our study provides critical system-level insights needed to predict the possible consequences of regional changes in forest diversity, composition, structure and function in the context of global change.

AB Biological invasions are increasingly being considered important spatial processes that drive global changes, threatening biodiversity, regional economies, and ecosystem functions. A unifying conceptual model of the invasion dynamics could serve as a useful tool for comparison and classification of invasion processes involving different species across large geographic ranges. By dividing these geographic ranges that are subject to invasions into discrete spatial units, we here conceptualize the invasion process as the transition from pristine to invaded spatial units. We use California cities as the spatial units and a long-term database of invasive tropical tephritids to characterize the invasion patterns. A new life-table method based on insect demography, including the progression model of invasion stage transition and the species-specific partitioning model of multispecies invasions, was developed to analyze the invasion patterns. The progression model allows us to estimate the probability and rate of transition for individual cities from pristine to infested stages and subsequently differentiate the first year of detection from detection recurrences. Importantly, we show that the interval of invasive tephritid recurrence in a city declines with increasing invasion stages of the city. The species-specific partitioning model revealed profound differences in invasion outcome depending on which tephritid species was first detected (and then locally eradicated) in the early stage of invasion. Taken together, we discuss how these two life-table invasion models can cast new light on existing invasion concepts; in particular, on formulating invasion dynamics as the state transition of cities and partitioning species-specific roles during multispecies invasions. These models provide a new set of tools for predicting the spatiotemporal progression of invasion and providing early warnings of recurrent invasions for efficient management.

AB Floral chemistry mediates plant interactions with herbivores, pathogens, and pollinators. The chemistry of floral nectar and pollen, the primary food rewards for pollinators, can affect both plant reproduction and pollinator health. Although the existence and functional significance of nectar and pollen secondary metabolites has long been known, comprehensive quantitative characterizations of secondary chemistry exist for only a few species. Moreover, little is known about intraspecific variation in nectar and pollen chemical profiles. Because the ecological effects of secondary chemicals are dose-dependent, heterogeneity across genotypes and populations could influence floral trait evolution and pollinator foraging ecology. To better understand within- and across-species heterogeneity in nectar and pollen secondary chemistry, we undertook exhaustive LC-MS and LC-UV-based chemical characterizations of nectar and pollen methanol extracts from 31 cultivated and wild plant species. Nectar and pollen were collected from farms and natural areas in Massachusetts, Vermont, and California, USA, in 2013 and 2014. For wild species, we aimed to collect 10 samples from each of three sites. For agricultural and horticultural species, we aimed for 10 samples from each of three cultivars. Our data set (1,535 samples, 102 identified compounds) identifies and quantifies each compound recorded in methanolic extracts, and includes chemical metadata that describe the molecular mass, retention time, and chemical classification of each compound. A reference phylogeny is included for comparative analyses. We found that each species possessed a distinct chemical profile; moreover, within species, few compounds were found in both nectar and pollen. The most common secondary chemical classes were flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids and amines, and chlorogenic acids. The most common compounds were quercetin and kaempferol glycosides. Pollens contained high concentrations of hydroxycinnamoyl-spermidine conjugates, mainly triscoumaroyl and trisferuloyl spermidine, found in 71% of species. When present, pollen alkaloids and spermidines had median nonzero concentrations of 23,000mol/L (median 52% of recorded micromolar composition). Although secondary chemistry was qualitatively consistent within each species and sample type, we found significant quantitative heterogeneity across cultivars and sites. These data provide a standard reference for future ecological and evolutionary research on nectar and pollen secondary chemistry, including its role in pollinator health and plant reproduction.

AB Marine protected areas (MPAs) have grown exponentially, emerging as a widespread tool to conserve biodiversity and enhance fisheries production. Although numerous empirical studies and global syntheses have evaluated the effects of MPAs on community structure (e.g., biodiversity), no broad assessment concerning their capacity to influence ecological processes (e.g., species interactions) exists. Here, we present meta-analyses that compare rates of predation and herbivory on a combined 32 species across 30 MPAs spanning 85 degrees of latitude. Our analyses synthesize the fate of 15,225 field experiment assays, and demonstrate that MPAs greatly increased predation intensity on animals but not herbivory on macroalgae or seagrass. Predation risk, quantified as the odds of prey being eaten, was largely determined by predator abundance and biomass within reserves. At MPAs with the greatest predator accumulation, the odds of predation increased to nearly 49:1, as opposed to 1:1 at MPAs where predators actually declined. Surprisingly, we also found evidence that predation risk declined with increased sea-surface temperature. Greater predation risk within MPAs was consistent with predator and prey population abundance estimates, where predators increased 4.4-fold within MPAs, whereas prey decreased 2.2-fold. For herbivory, the lack of change may have been driven by functional redundancy and the inability of reserves to increase herbivore abundance relative to fished zones in our sample. Overall, this work highlights the capacity of MPAs to restore a critical ecosystem function such as predation, which mediates energy flows and community assembly within natural systems. However, our review of the literature also uncovers relatively few studies that have quantified the effects of MPAs on ecosystem function, highlighting a key gap in our understanding of how protected areas may alter ecological processes and deliver ecosystem services. From a historical perspective, these findings suggest that modern levels of predation in the coastal oceans may currently only be a fraction of the baseline prior to human exploitation.

AB The diversity and composition of local communities depends strongly on the pool of species that have been able to colonize that community from elsewhere. Typically this is thought to depend on a larger regional species pool that is subject to local environmental constraints that act as "filters." Often, however, colonists arrive from multiple sources that differ in habitat conditions and have therefore already experienced distinct "prefiltering." Consequently, it is the interaction of species from these distinct pools that determine the composition of local communities. This interaction is particularly important when certain colonist pools provide keystone species with disproportionate roles on community assembly. We propose to identify these key colonist pools and their interaction with local habitat filters by quantifying community-level responses to colonist pool manipulation. We tested this framework to assess the contribution of surface and burrow sediment bacteria to bacterial communities associated with the fiddler crab, Uca panacea. In a mesocosm experiment, we combined normal and autoclaved surface and burrow sediment in a factorial experimental design, and we evaluated the community-level responses of carapace and gut microbial assemblages to sediment treatments with next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Results from carapace bacterial communities indicate that burrow sediments contribute most recruits, but surface sediments provide a few key colonizers that become established in the carapace community. In contrast, the composition of gut-associated microbial communities responded only to surface bacteria manipulation, despite being highly dissimilar from the community composition in both the surface and burrow source pools. These results suggest that assembly in the gut depends primarily on colonization from the surface sediment and regulation by habitat filtering. For fiddler crab-associated bacteria, we can conclude that key colonist pools and habitat filters regulate the influence of multiple colonist pools. Incorporating and distinguishing the contribution of multiple sources of species, rather than a single regional species pool, may better explain community dynamics in many systems, especially those with weak habitat filters.

AB Temperature-induced alterations in phenology and body size are the cumulative outcome of sequential effects impacting development and are universal responses to climate change. Most studies have so far focused on phenological responses to warming in multiple taxa across space and time, or the ontogenetic effects of temperature in the laboratory. I here complement this work by investigating shifts in phenology and body size (wing length) attributable to temperature changes operating over the entire lifespan of the univoltine orange-tip butterfly Anthocharis cardamines in a single wild population over 14 generations. Phenology was affected by temperatures during three discrete periods in the year prior to emergence, corresponding to late larval/early pupal life, the onset of the chilling period required to break pupal diapause, and postdiapause pupal development prior to eclosion. Higher temperatures during late larval/early pupal life and postdiapause pupal development advanced the subsequent emergence of the butterflies, whereas higher temperatures at the onset of the chilling period retarded it. The synchronization of the butterflies' emergence schedule increased when pupae were exposed to milder midwinter temperatures. Wing length increased with warmer temperatures at distinct points in the early and midpupal periods; such direct effects of temperature on body size could complement season length effects in explaining the reversal of the temperature-size rule in univoltine insects. The periods during which temperature affected the phenology of the butterfly only partially overlapped those affecting the first flowering date of its host plants lady's smock (Cardamine pratensis) and garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata). Observed thermal effects on flowering time, emergence timing, and emergence synchronization indicate that phenological convergence as well as phenological mismatching could affect host-plant availability and diet breadth; thermal effects on body size imply that important population-level processes could be impacted through correlated changes in fecundity and dispersal rate. In general, the combined effects of phenological and ontogenetic responses to temperature changes across the whole lifespan will likely be important in modeling the demographic responses of interacting species to climate change.

AB The forests of western Amazonia are among the most diverse tree communities on Earth, yet this exceptional diversity is distributed highly unevenly within and among communities. In particular, a small number of dominant species account for the majority of individuals, whereas the large majority of species are locally and regionally extremely scarce. By definition, dominant species contribute little to local species richness (alpha diversity), yet the importance of dominant species in structuring patterns of spatial floristic turnover (beta diversity) has not been investigated. Here, using a network of 207 forest inventory plots, we explore the role of dominant species in determining regional patterns of beta diversity (community-level floristic turnover and distance-decay relationships) across a range of habitat types in northern lowland Peru. Of the 2,031 recorded species in our data set, only 99 of them accounted for 50% of individuals. Using these 99 species, it was possible to reconstruct the overall features of regional beta diversity patterns, including the location and dispersion of habitat types in multivariate space, and distance-decay relationships. In fact, our analysis demonstrated that regional patterns of beta diversity were better maintained by the 99 dominant species than by the 1,932 others, whether quantified using species-abundance data or species presence-absence data. Our results reveal that dominant species are normally common only in a single forest type. Therefore, dominant species play a key role in structuring western Amazonian tree communities, which in turn has important implications, both practically for designing effective protected areas, and more generally for understanding the determinants of beta diversity patterns.

AB Moving beyond species count data is an essential step to better understand the effects of environmental perturbations on biodiversity and ecosystem functions, and to eventually better predict the strength and direction of those effects. Here, coupling an integrative path analysis approach with data from an extensive countrywide monitoring program, we tested the main spatial, environmental and anthropogenic drivers of change in the functional structure of aquatic macroinvertebrate communities along the entire Swiss Rhine river catchment. Functional structure was largely driven by inherent altitudinal variation influencing and cascading to regional scaled factors such as land use change and position in the riverine network, which, in turn, transformed local habitat structure variables. Those cascading effects across scales propagated through the biotic community, first affecting prey and, in turn, predators. Our results illustrate how seemingly less important local factors can act as essential transmission belts, propagating through direct and indirect pathways across scales to generate the specific context in which each functional group will strive or not, leading to characteristic landscape wide variations in functional community structure.

AB Forest fragments in highly disturbed landscapes provide important ecosystem services ranging from acting as biodiversity reservoir to providing timber or regulating hydrology. Managing the tree species richness and composition of these fragments to optimize their functioning and the deliverance of multiple ecosystem services is of great practical relevance. However, both the strength and direction of tree species richness and tree species composition effects on forest ecosystem multifunctionality may depend on the landscape context in which these forest remnants are embedded. Taking advantage of an observatory network of 53 temperate forest plots varying in tree species richness, tree species composition, and fragmentation intensity we measured 24 ecosystem functions spanning multiple trophic levels and analyzed how tree species diversity-multifunctionality relationships changed with fragmentation intensity. Our results show that fragmentation generally increases multifunctionality and strengthens its positive relationship with diversity, possibly due to edge effects. In addition, different tree species combinations optimize functioning under different fragmentation levels. We conclude that management and restoration of forest fragments aimed at maximizing ecosystem multifunctionality should be tailored to the specific landscape context. As forest fragmentation will continue, tree diversity will become increasingly important to maintain forest functioning.

AB Although increased frequency of extreme-weather events is one of the most secure predictions associated with contemporary climate change, effects of such events on distribution and abundance of climate-sensitive species remain poorly understood. Montane ecosystems may be especially sensitive to extreme weather because of complex abiotic and biotic interactions that propagate from climate-driven reductions in snowpack. Snowpack not only protects subnivean biotas from extreme cold, but also influences forage availability through timing of melt-off and water availability. We related relative abundances of an alpine mammal, the American pika (Ochotona princeps), to measures of weather and snowpack dynamics over an 8-yr period that included before and after a year of record-low snowpack in Washington, USA. We sought to (1) quantify any change in pika abundance associated with the snowpack anomaly and (2) identify aspects of weather and snowpack that influenced abundance of pikas. Pikas showed a 1-yr lag response to the snowpack anomaly and exhibited marked declines in abundance at elevations below 1,400 m simultaneous with increased abundances at higher elevations. Atmospheric moisture, indexed by vapor pressure deficit (VPD), was especially important, evidenced by strong support for the top-ranked model that included the interaction of VPD with snowpack duration. Notably, our novel application of VPD from gridded climate data for analyses of animal abundances shows strong potential for improving species distribution models because VPD represents an important aspect of weather that influences the physiology and habitat of biota. Pikas were apparently affected by cold stress without snowpack at mid elevations, whereas changes to forage associated with snowpack and VPD were influential at high and low elevations. Our results reveal context dependency in pika responses to weather and illustrate how snow drought can lead to rapid change in the abundance of subnivean animals.

AB Researchers have long viewed patterns of species association as key to understanding the processes that structure communities. Community-level tests of species association have received the most attention; however, pairwise species associations may offer greater opportunity for linking patterns to specific mechanisms. Although several tests of pairwise association have been developed, there remain gaps in our understanding of their performance. Consequently, it is unclear whether these methods reliably detect patterns of association, or if any one method is superior. We maximized association patterns for single species pairs in synthetic community matrices and examined how accurately five pairwise association tests found that pair, while not finding others (i.e., type I and II error rates). All tests are more likely to miss patterns of association than to falsely detect them. When we maximized association for a species pair that included one or more rare or common species, tests were frequently unable to identify that pair as significantly associated. Consequently, these tests are best suited for identifying significant associations between pairs of species that occur in an intermediate number of samples; for such pairs, three of the five tests considered here detected 100% of the pairs for which we maximized associations.

AB Previous work suggests that animal water balance can influence trophic interactions, with predators increasing their consumption of water-laden prey to meet water demands. But it is unclear how the need for water interacts with the need for energy to drive trophic interactions under shifting conditions. Using manipulative field experiments, we show that water balance influences the effects of top predators on prey with contrasting ratios of water and energy, altering the frequency of intraguild predation. Water-stressed top predators (large spiders) negatively affect water-laden basal prey (crickets), especially male prey with higher water content, whereas alleviation of water limitation causes top predators to switch to negatively affecting energy-rich midlevel predators (small spiders). Thus, the relative water and energy content of multiple prey, combined with the water demand of the top predator, influences trophic interactions in ways that can alter the strength of intraguild predation. These findings underscore the need for integration of multiresource approaches for understanding implications of global change for food webs.

AB Climate warming will likely destabilize populations or drive consumers locally extinct. These predictions arise from consumer-resource models incorporating temperature-dependent parameters, and the accuracy of these predictions hinges on the validity of temperature scalings for each parameter. Among all parameters, carrying capacity (K) is the most ill-defined and the temperature scaling of this parameter has no empirically verified foundation. Most studies assume that K declines exponentially with warming, but others have assumed a positive or no relationship between K and temperature. Here, I developed a theoretical foundation for a temperature scaling of K based on physiological principles of temperature and nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth. The trade-off between thermodynamics and nutrient uptake yields a unimodal thermal response curve for K, and this prediction is supported by empirical data on both phytoplankton and insects. Analyses of consumer-resource models demonstrate the primacy of K in determining predictions of coexistence and stability. Since K exerts a dominant influence on model predictions, ecologists should carefully consider the temperature scaling of K for the species and region in question to ensure accurate estimates of population stability and extinction risk.

AB A conspicuous season-diversity relationship (SDR) can be seen in seasonal environments, often with a defined peak in active species diversity in the growing season. We ask is this a general pattern and are other patterns possible? In addition, we ask what is the ultimate cause of this pattern and can we understand it using existing ecological theory? To accomplish this task, we assembled a global database on changes in species diversity through time in seasonal environments for different taxa and habitats and also conducted a modeling study in an attempt to replicate observed patterns. Our global database includes terrestrial and aquatic habitats, temperate, tropical, and polar environments, and taxa from disparate groups including vertebrates, insects, and plankton. We constructed nine alternative models that vary in assumptions on type of seasonal forcing, responses to that forcing, species niches, and types of species interactions. We found that most guilds of species exhibit a repeatable SDR across years. For north temperate ecosystems, active species diversity generally peaks mid-year. The peak for a guild is generally more pronounced in terrestrial habitats than aquatic habitats and more pronounced in temperate and polar regions than the tropics. We now have evidence that at least several different habitat and taxa types are likely to have multiple peaks in diversity in a year, for example, guilds of both aquatic microbes and desert vertebrates can show a bimodal or multimodal SDR. We compared all nine candidate models in their ability to explain the patterns and match their assumptions to the data. Some performed considerably better than others in being able to match the different patterns. We conclude that a model that includes both temperature niches and environmental feedbacks is necessary to explain the different SDRs. We use such a model to make predictions about how the SDR could be impacted by climate change. More effort should be put into documenting and understanding baseline seasonal patterns in diversity in order to predict future responses to global change.

AB Tropical forests play a dominant role in the global carbon (C) cycle, and models predict increases in tropical net primary productivity (NPP) and C storage in response to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. The extent to which increasing CO2 will enhance NPP depends in part on the availability of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to support growth. Some tropical trees can potentially overcome nutrient limitation by acquiring N via symbiotic dinitrogen (N-2) fixation, which may provide a benefit in acquiring P via investment in N-rich phosphatase enzymes or arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. We conducted a seedling experiment to investigate the effects of elevated CO2 and soil nutrient availability on the growth of two N-2-fixing and two non-N-2-fixing tropical tree species. We hypothesized that under elevated CO2 and at low nutrient availability (i.e., low N and P), N-2 fixers would have higher growth rates than non-N-2 fixers because N-2 fixers have a greater capacity to acquire both N and P. We also hypothesized that differences in growth rates between N-2 fixers and non-N-2 fixers would decline as nutrient availability increases because N-2 fixers no longer have an advantage in nutrient acquisition. We found that the N-2 fixers had higher growth rates than the non-N-2 fixers under elevated CO2 and at low nutrient availability, and that the difference in growth rates between the N-2 and non-N-2 fixers declined as nutrient availability increased, irrespective of CO2. Overall, N-2 fixation, root phosphatase activity, and AM colonization decreased with increasing nutrient availability, and increased under elevated CO2 at low nutrient availability. Further, AM colonization was positively related to the growth of the non-N-2 fixers, whereas both N-2 fixation and root phosphatase activity were positively related to the growth of the N-2 fixers. Though our results indicate all four tree species have the capacity to up- or down-regulate nutrient acquisition to meet their stoichiometric demands, the greater capacity for the N-2 fixers to acquire both N and P may enable them to overcome nutritional constraints to NPP under elevated CO2, with implications for the response of tropical forests to future environmental change.

AB The starvation-predation hypothesis predicts that, during resource shortages, prey forego antipredator behavior and forage as much as possible to avoid starvation, even when risk of predation is high. We tested this hypothesis using GPS locations collected simultaneously from moose (Alces alces) and wolves (Canis lupus) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem of North America. We assessed shifts in the speed, displacement, and habitat selection of moose 24 h following encounter with wolves (0-1,500 m distance). We examined whether the strength of antipredator behaviors would weaken as winter progressed and the nutritional condition of moose declined. Moose responded to wolf encounters by increasing their rate of movement in early winter, but only within 500 m distance. Importantly, these responses attenuated as winter progressed. Moose did not avoid their preferred foraging habitat (riparian areas) following encounters with wolves at any distance, and instead they more strongly selected riparian areas, especially in early winter. Our findings support theoretical predictions that resource deficits should dampen prey antipredator behavior, and suggest that nutritional condition of prey may buffer against run-away risk effects in food webs involving large mammalian predators and prey.

AB Joint species distribution modeling has enabled researchers to move from species-level to community-level analyses, leading to statistically more efficient and ecologically more informative use of data. Here, we propose joint species movement modeling (JSMM) as an analogous approach that enables inferring both species- and community-level movement parameters from multispecies movement data. The species-level movement parameters are modeled as a function of species traits and phylogenetic relationships, allowing one to ask how species traits influence movements, and whether phylogenetically related species are similar in their movement behavior. We illustrate the modeling framework with two contrasting case studies: a stochastic redistribution model for direct observations of bird movements and a spatially structured diffusion model for capture-recapture data on moth movements. In both cases, the JSMM identified several traits that explain differences in movement behavior among species, such as movement rate increasing with body size in both birds and moths. We show with simulations that the JSMM approach increases precision of species-specific parameter estimates by borrowing information from other species that are closely related or have similar traits. The JSMM framework is applicable for many kinds of data, and it facilitates a mechanistic understanding of the causes and consequences of interspecific variation in movement behavior.

AB The inability of species to adapt to changing climate may cause ecological communities to disassemble and lose ecological functioning. However, theory suggests that communities may be resilient whenever populations within species exhibit variation in thermal plasticity or adaptation whereby thermally tolerant populations replace thermally sensitive ones. But will they maintain the functional roles of the populations being replaced? This study evaluated whether "like replaces like" functionally by measuring how four populations of a grasshopper herbivore and its co-occurring spider predator cope with environmental warming. The study occurred across a latitudinal gradient bounded by southerly, warmer Connecticut and northerly, cooler New Hampshire, USA. The study compared the survival rates, thermal performance, habitat usage, and food chain interactions of each grasshopper and spider population between its home field site (field of origin) and a Connecticut transplant site, and the native Connecticut population. Three grasshopper populations exhibited physiological plasticity by adjusting metabolic rates. The fourth population selected cooler habitat locations. Spider populations did not alter their metabolism and instead selected cooler habitat locations, thereby altering spatial overlap with their prey and food chain interactions. Grasshopper populations that coped physiologically consumed plants in different ratios than the fourth population and the Connecticut population. Hence, "like may not replace like" whenever populations adapt physiologically to warming.

AB High rates of land conversion and land use change have vastly increased the proportion of secondary forest in the lowland tropics relative to mature forest. As secondary forests recover following abandonment, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) must be present in sufficient quantities to sustain high rates of net primary production and to replenish the nutrients lost during land use prior to secondary forest establishment. Biogeochemical theory and results from individual studies suggest that N can recuperate during secondary forest recovery, especially relative to P. Here, we synthesized 23 metrics of N and P in soil and plants from 45 secondary forest chronosequences located in the wet tropics to empirically explore (1) whether there is a consistent change in nutrients and nutrient cycling processes during secondary succession in the biome; (2) which metrics of N and P in soil and plants recuperate most consistently; (3) if the recuperation of nutrients during succession approaches similar nutrient concentrations and fluxes as those in mature forest in similar to 100 yr following the initiation of succession; and (4) whether site characteristics, including disturbance history, climate, and soil order are significantly related to nutrient recuperation. During secondary forest succession, nine metrics of N and/or P cycling changed consistently and substantially. In most sites, N concentrations and fluxes in both plants and soil increased during secondary succession, and total P concentrations increased in surface soil. Changes in nutrient concentrations and nutrient cycling processes during secondary succession were similar whether mature forest was included or excluded from the analysis, indicating that nutrient recuperation in secondary forest leads to biogeochemical conditions that are similar to those of mature forest. Further, of the N and P metrics that recuperated, only soil total P and foliar delta N-15 were strongly influenced by site characteristics like climate, soils, or disturbance history. Predictable nutrient recuperation across a diverse and productive ecosystem may support future forest growth and could provide a means to quantify successful restoration of ecosystem function in secondary tropical forest beyond biomass or species composition.

AB Co-occurrence with humans presents substantial risks for large carnivores, yet human-dominated landscapes are increasingly crucial to carnivore conservation as human land use continues to encroach on wildlife habitat. Flexibility in large carnivore behavior may be a primary factor mediating coexistence with people, allowing carnivores to calibrate their activity and habitat use to the perceived level of human risk. However, our understanding of how large carnivores adjust the timing and location of behaviors in response to variations in human activity across the landscape remains limited, impacting our ability to identify important habitat for populations outside of protected areas. Here we examine whether African lions (Panthera leo) modify their behavior and habitat use in response to risk of a human encounter, and whether behavior-specific habitat selection allows lions to access feeding opportunities in a human-dominated landscape in Kenya. We determined fine-scale behavioral states for lions using high-resolution GPS and accelerometer data, and then investigated behavior-specific habitat selection at multiple temporal and spatial scales (ranging from 15 minutes to 12 hours and from approximately 200 meters to several kilometers). We found that lions exhibit substantial differences in habitat selection with respect to humans based on behavioral state and time of day. During the day, when risk of human encounter is highest, lions avoided areas of high human use when resting, meandering, and feeding. However, lions specifically selected for habitat near people when feeding at night. Flexible habitat use by lions thus permits access to prey, which appear to concentrate in areas near humans. The importance of habitat near people for feeding was only apparent when analyses explicitly accounted for lion behavioral state and spatiotemporal scale, highlighting the necessity of incorporating such information when investigating human impacts on large carnivore habitat use. Our results support the contention that behavior-specific habitat selection promotes carnivore persistence in human-dominated landscapes, demonstrating the importance of considering not just whether but how large carnivores use habitat near humans when managing vulnerable populations.

AB Regenerating tropical forests have an immense capacity to capture carbon and harbor biodiversity. The recuperation of the nitrogen cycle following disturbance can fuel biomass regeneration, but few studies have evaluated the successional dynamics of nitrogen and nitrogen inputs in tropical forests. We assessed symbiotic and asymbiotic nitrogen fixation, soil inorganic nitrogen concentrations, and tree growth in a well-studied series of five tropical forest plots ranging from 19 yr in age to old-growth forests. Wet-season soil inorganic nitrogen concentrations were high in all plots, peaking in the 29-yr-old plot. Inputs from symbiotic nitrogen fixation declined through succession, while asymbiotic nitrogen fixation peaked in the 37-yr-old plot. Consequently, the dominant nitrogen fixation input switched from symbiotic fixation in the younger plots to asymbiotic fixation in the older plots. Tree growth was highest in the youngest plots and declined through succession. Interestingly, symbiotic nitrogen fixation was negatively correlated with the basal area of nitrogen-fixing trees across our study plots, highlighting the danger in using nitrogen-fixing trees as a proxy for rates of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Our results demonstrate that the nitrogen cycle has largely recuperated by 19 yr following disturbance, allowing for rapid biomass regeneration at our site. This work provides important insight into the sources and dynamics of nitrogen that support growth and carbon capture in regenerating Neotropical forests.

AB Recent studies have highlighted the importance of higher-order competitive interactions in stabilizing population dynamics in multi-species communities. But how does the structure of competitive hierarchies affect population dynamics and extinction processes? We tackled this important question by using spatially explicit simulations of ecological drift (10 species in a homogeneous landscape of 64 patches) in which birth rates were influenced by interspecific competition. Specifically, we examined how transitive (linear pecking orders) and intransitive (pecking orders with loops) competitive hierarchies affected extinction rates and population dynamics in simulated communities through time. In comparison to a pure neutral model, an ecological drift model including transitive competition increased extinction rates, caused synchronous density-dependent population fluctuations, and generated a white-noise distribution of population sizes. In contrast, the drift model with intransitive competitive interactions decreased extinctions rates, caused asynchronous (compensatory) density-dependent population fluctuations, and generated a brown noise distribution of population sizes. We also explored the effect on community stability of more complex patterns of competitive interactions in which pairwise competitive relationships were assigned probabilistically. These probabilistic competition models also generated density-dependent trajectories and a brown noise distribution of population sizes. However, extinction rates and the degree of population synchrony were comparable to those observed in purely neutral communities. Collectively, our results confirm that intransitive competition has a strong and stabilizing effect on local populations in species-poor communities. This effect wanes with increasing species richness. Empirical assemblages characterized by brown spectral noise, density-dependent regulation, and asynchronous (compensatory) population fluctuations may indicate a signature of intransitive competitive interactions.

AB Population-wide outcomes such as abundance, reproductive output, or mean survival can be stabilized by non-synchronous variation in the performance of individuals or subpopulations. Such "portfolio effects" have been increasingly documented at the scale of subpopulations and are thought to play an important role in generating stability of population phenomena in the face of environmental variation. However, few studies quantify the strength and origin of portfolio effects at the finer scale of individuals. We used 16 yr of fruit production and climate data for an alpine plant to dissect the scale of portfolio effects in reproduction, as well as the contribution of individual traits including size and flowering time in driving reproductive output. Asynchrony in reproductive success substantially reduces variation in population-level reproductive output, with approximately one-fourth of this stabilizing effect arising from individual differences, mostly not those characterized by measured traits, and approximately three-fourths from asynchrony across subpopulations. These results emphasize the different scales and causes of portfolio effects. The decomposition for portfolio effects we provide can facilitate similar breakdowns of the strength and causes of these effects in other systems.

AB Introduced species may homogenize biotic communities. Whether this homogenization can erase latitudinal patterns of species diversity and composition has not been well studied. We examined this by comparing nematode and microbial communities in stands of native Phragmites australis and exotic Spartina alterniflora in coastal wetlands across 18 degrees of latitude in China. We found clear latitudinal clines in nematode diversity and functional composition, and in microbial composition, for soils collected from native P. australis. These latitudinal patterns were weak or absent for soils collected from nearby stands of the exotic S. alterniflora. Climatic and edaphic variables varied across latitude in similar ways in both community types. In P. australis there were strong correlations between community structure and environmental variables, whereas in S. alterniflora these correlations were weak. These results suggest that the invasion of S. alterniflora into the Chinese coastal wetlands has caused profound biotic homogenization of soil communities across latitude. We speculate that the variation in P. australis nematode and microbial communities across latitude is primarily driven by geographic variation in plant traits, but that such variation in plant traits is largely lacking for the recently introduced exotic S. alterniflora. These results indicate that widespread exotic species can homogenize nematode communities at large spatial scales.

AB There is strong evidence for a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning at local spatial scales. However, how different aspects of biodiversity relate to multiple ecosystem functions (multifunctionality) across heterogeneous landscapes, and how the magnitude of biodiversity, dominant species, and environmental effects on functioning compare, remain poorly understood. We compared relationships between plant phylogenetic, functional, and taxonomic diversity and ecosystem multifunctionality across 29 restored grasslands. Functional diversity was positively associated with multifunctionality, more strongly than other diversity measures; however, landscape composition explained nearly four times more variation in multifunctionality than did functional diversity, with plots within human-modified landscapes supporting lower multifunctionality. Individual functions were typically more strongly correlated with environmental variables than with diversity. We also found that abundance of the dominant species, Andropogon gerardii, was positively correlated with multifunctionality. Plant diversity, dominant species, and underlying environmental conditions underpin ecosystem multifunctionality in grasslands, but how biodiversity is measured matters for the strength and direction of biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships. Finally, in natural systems environmental variation unrelated to local biodiversity is important for determining ecosystem functioning.

AB Despite the importance of fine roots for the acquisition of soil resources such as nitrogen and water, the study of linkages between traits and both population and community dynamics remains focused on aboveground traits. We address this gap by investigating associations between belowground traits and metrics of species dynamics. Our analysis included 85 species from a long-term data set on the transition from old field to forest in eastern North America (the Buell-Small Succession Study) and the new Fine-Root Ecology Database. Given the prominent roles of life form (woody vs. non-woody) and species origin (native vs. exotic) in defining functional relationships, we also assessed whether traits or their relationships with species dynamics differed for these groups. Species that reached their peak abundance early in succession had fine-root traits corresponding to resource acquisitive strategies (i.e., they were thinner, less dense, and had higher nitrogen concentrations) while species that peaked progressively later had increasingly conservative strategies. In addition to having more acquisitive root traits than native species, exotics diverged from the above successional trend, having consistently thinner fine roots regardless of the community context. Species with more acquisitive fine-root morphologies typically had faster rates of abundance increase and achieved their maximal rates in fewer years. Decreasing soil nutrient availability and increasing belowground competition may become increasingly strong filters in successional communities, acting on root traits to promote a transition from acquisitive to conservative foraging. However, disturbances that increase light and soil resource availability at local scales may allow acquisitive species, especially invasive exotics, to continue colonizing late into the community transition to forest.

AB Predator responses to gradients in prey density have important implications for population regulation and are a potential structuring force for subtidal marine communities, particularly on rocky reefs where herbivorous sea urchins can drive community state shifts. On rocky reefs in southern California where predatory sea otters have been extirpated, top-down control of sea urchins by alternative predators has been hypothesized but rarely tested experimentally. In laboratory feeding assays, predatory spiny lobsters (Panulirus interruptus) demonstrated a saturating functional response to urchin prey, whereby urchin proportional mortality was inversely density-dependent. In field experiments on rocky reefs near San Diego, California, predators (primarily the labrid fish California sheephead, Semicossyphus pulcher) inflicted highly variable mortality on purple urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) prey across all density levels. However, at low to moderate densities commonly observed within kelp forests, purple urchin mortality increased to a peak at a density of similar to 11 urchins/m(2). Above that level, at densities typical of urchin barrens, purple urchin mortality was density-independent. When larger red urchins (Mesocentrotus franciscanus) were offered to predators simultaneously with purple urchins, mortality was density-independent. Underwater videography revealed a positive relationship between purple urchin density and both the number and richness of fish predators, but these correlations were not observed when red urchins were present. Our results demonstrate highly variable mortality rates across prey densities in this system and suggest that top-down control of urchins can occur only under limited circumstances. Our findings provide insight into the dynamics of alternate community states observed on rocky reefs.

AB Major tropical storms are destructive phenomena with large effects on the community dynamics of multiple biomes. On coral reefs, their impacts have been described for decades, leading to the expectation that future storms should have effects similar to those recorded in the past. This expectation relies on the assumption that storm intensities will remain unchanged, and the impacted coral reef communities are similar to those of the recent past; neither assumption is correct. This study quantified the effects of two category five hurricanes on the reefs of St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, where 31 yr of time-series analyses reveal chronic coral mortality, increasing macroalgal abundance, and five major hurricanes that caused acute coral mortality. Contextualized by these trends, the effects of the most recent storms, Hurricanes Irma and Maria (September 2017), on coral cover were modest. While mean absolute coral cover declined 1-4% depending on site, these effects were not statistically discernable. Following decades of increasing abundance of macroalgae, this functional group responded to the recent hurricanes with large increases in abundance on both absolute and relative scales. Decades of chronic mortality have changed the coral assemblages of St. John to create degraded communities that are resistant to severe storms.

AB Positive biodiversity-ecosystem-functioning (BEF) relationships are commonly found in experimental and observational studies, but how they vary in different environmental contexts and under the influence of coexisting life forms is still controversial. Investigating these variations is important for making predictions regarding the dynamics of plant communities and carbon pools under global change. We conducted this study across 433 shrubland sites in northern China. We fitted structural equation models (SEMs) to analyze the variation in the species-richness-biomass relationships of shrubs and herbs along a wetness gradient and general liner models (GLMs) to analyze how shrub or herb biomass affected the species-richness-biomass relationship of the other life form. We found that the positive species-richness-biomass relationships for both shrubs and herbs became weaker or even negative with higher water availability, likely indicating stronger interspecific competition within life forms under more benign conditions. After accounting for variation in environmental contexts using residual regression, we found that the benign effect of greater facilitation by a larger shrub biomass reduced the positive species-richness-biomass relationships of herbs, causing them to become nonsignificant. Different levels of herb biomass, however, did not change the species-richness-biomass relationship of shrubs, possibly because greater herb biomass did not alter the stress level for shrubs. We conclude that biodiversity in the studied plant communities is particularly important for plant biomass production under arid conditions and that it might be possible to use shrubs as nurse plants to facilitate understory herb establishment in ecological restoration.

AB Fire, a frequent disturbance in the Mediterranean, affects pollinator communities. We explored the response of major pollinator guilds to fire severity, across a fire-severity gradient at different spatial scales. We show that the abundance of all pollinator groups responded to fire severity, and that bees and beetles showed in addition a significant species-diversity response. Bees, sawflies, and wasps responded to fire severity at relatively small spatial scales (250-300 m), whereas flies and beetles responded at larger spatial scales. The response of bees, sawflies, and wasps was unimodal, as predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, whereas flies and beetles showed a negative response. A possible explanation is that the observed patterns (spatial scale and type of response) are driven by taxa-specific ecological and life-history traits, such as nesting preference and body size, as well as the availability of resources in the postfire landscape. Our observational study provides an insight into the effect of fire severity on pollinators. However, future research exploring the explicit link between the pre- and postfire landscape structure and pollinator traits and responses is required for further establishment and understanding of cause-effect relationships.

AB Microbialites, organosedimentary carbonate structures, cover approximately 20% of the basin floor in the south arm of Great Salt Lake, which ranges from similar to 12 to 15% salinity. Photosynthetic microbial mats associated with these benthic mounds contribute biomass that supports secondary production in the ecosystem, including that of the brine shrimp, Artemia franciscana. However, the effects of predicted increases in the salinity of the lake on the productivity and composition of these mats and on A. franciscana fecundity is not well documented. In the present study, we applied molecular and microcosm-based approaches to investigate the effects of changing salinity on (1) the primary productivity, abundance, and composition of microbialite-associated mats of GSL, and (2) the fecundity and survivability of the secondary consumer, A. franciscana. When compared to microcosms incubated closest to the in situ measured salinity of 15.6%, the abundance of 16S rRNA gene templates increased in microcosms with lower salinities and decreased in those with higher salinities following a 7-week incubation period. The abundance of 16S rRNA gene sequences affiliated with dominant primary producers, including the cyanobacterium Euhalothece and the diatom Navicula, increased in microcosms incubated at decreased salinity, but decreased in microcosms incubated at increased salinity. Increased salinity also decreased the rate of primary production in microcosm assays containing mats incubated for 7 weeks and decreased the number of A. franciscana cysts that hatched and survived. These results indicate that an increase in the salinity of GSL is likely to have a negative impact on the productivity of microbialite communities and the fecundity and survivability of A. franciscana. These observations suggest that a sustained increase in the salinity of GSL and the effects this has on primary and secondary production could have an upward and negative cascading effect on higher-trophic-level ecological compartments that depend on A. franciscana as a food source, including a number of species of migratory birds.

ID FACILITATION; COMPETITION; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; CONSEQUENCES
AB Plants grow in communities where they interact with other plants and with other living organisms such as pollinators. On the one hand, studies of plant-plant interactions rarely consider how plants interact with other trophic levels such as pollinators. On the other, studies of plant-animal interactions rarely deal with interactions within trophic levels such as plant-plant competition and facilitation. Thus, to what degree plant interactions affect biodiversity and ecological networks across trophic levels is poorly understood. We manipulated plant communities driven by foundation species facilitation and sampled plant-pollinator networks at fine spatial scale in a field experiment in Sierra Nevada, Spain. We found that plant-plant facilitation shaped pollinator diversity and structured pollination networks. Nonadditive effects of plant interactions on pollinator diversity and interaction diversity were synergistic in one foundation species networks while they were additive in another foundation species. Nonadditive effects of plant interactions were due to rewiring of pollination interactions. In addition, plant facilitation had negative effects on the structure of pollination networks likely due to increase in plant competition for pollination. Our results empirically demonstrate how different network types are coupled, revealing pervasive consequences of interaction chains in diverse communities.

AB Determining the degree to which predation affects prey abundance in natural communities constitutes a key goal of ecological research. Predators can affect prey through both consumptive effects (CEs) and nonconsumptive effects (NCEs), although the contributions of each mechanism to the density of prey populations remain largely hypothetical in most systems. Common statistical methods applied to time-series data cannot elucidate the mechanisms responsible for hypothesized predator effects on prey density (e.g., differentiate CEs from NCEs), nor can they provide parameters for predictive models. State-space models (SSMs) applied to time-series data offer a way to meet these goals. Here, we employ SSMs to assess effects of an invasive predatory zooplankter, Bythotrephes longimanus, on an important prey species, Daphnia mendotae, in Lake Michigan. We fit mechanistic models in an SSM framework to seasonal time series (1994-2012) using a recently developed, maximum-likelihood-based optimization method, iterated filtering, which can overcome challenges in ecological data (e.g., nonlinearities, measurement error, and irregular sampling intervals). Our results indicate that B. longimanus strongly influences D. mendotae dynamics, with mean annual peak densities of B. longimanus observed in Lake Michigan estimated to cause a 61% reduction in D. mendotae population growth rate and a 59% reduction in peak biomass density. Further, the observed B. longimanus effect is most consistent with an NCE via reduced birth rates. The SSM approach also provided estimates for key biological parameters (e.g., demographic rates) and the contribution of dynamic stochasticity and measurement error. Our study therefore provides evidence derived directly from survey data that the invasive zooplankter B. longimanus is affecting zooplankton demographics and offer parameter estimates needed to inform predictive models that explore the effect of B. longimanus under different scenarios, such as climate change.

AB Environmental filtering and dispersal limitation can both maintain diversity in plant communities by aggregating conspecifics, but parsing the contribution of each process has proven difficult empirically. Here, we assess the contribution of filtering and dispersal limitation to the spatial aggregation patterns of 456 tree species in a hyperdiverse Amazonian forest and find distinct functional trait correlates of interspecific variation in these processes. Spatial point process model analysis revealed that both mechanisms are important drivers of intraspecific aggregation for the majority of species. Leaf drought tolerance was correlated with species topographic distributions in this aseasonal rainforest, showing that future increases in drought severity could significantly impact community structure. In addition, seed mass was associated with the spatial scale and density of dispersal-related aggregation. Taken together, these results suggest environmental filtering and dispersal limitation act in concert to influence the spatial and functional structure of diverse forest communities.

AB Kelp systems dominate nearshore marine environments in upwelling zones characterized by cold temperatures and high nutrients. Worldwide, kelp population persistence and recruitment success generally decreases with rising water temperatures coupled with low nutrients, making kelp populations vulnerable to impending warming of the oceans. This response to climate change at a global scale, however, may vary due to regional differences in temperature variability, acclimation, and differential responses of kelp species to changing conditions. Culture experiments were conducted on 12 eastern Pacific kelp taxa across geographic regions (British Columbia, central California, and southern California) under three nitrate levels (1, 5, and 10 mu mol/L) and two temperatures (12 degrees C and 18 degrees C) to determine sporophyte production (i.e., recruitment success). For all taxa from all locations, sporophytes were always present in the 12 degrees C treatment and when recruitment failure was observed, it always occurred at 18 degrees C, regardless of nitrate level, indicating that temperature is the driving factor limiting recruitment, not nitrate. Rising ocean temperatures will undoubtedly cause recruitment failure for many kelp species; however, the ability of species to acclimatize or adapt to increased temperatures at the warmer edge of their species range may promote a resiliency of kelp systems to climate change at a global scale.

AB Forest dynamics and tree species composition vary substantially between Paleotropical and Neotropical forests, but these broad biogeographic regions are treated uniformly in many land models. To assess whether these regional differences translate into variation in productivity and carbon (C) storage, we compiled a database of climate, tree stem growth, litterfall, aboveground net primary production (ANPP), and aboveground biomass across tropical rainforest sites spanning 33 countries throughout Central and South America, Asia, and Australasia, but excluding Africa due to a paucity of available data. Though the sum of litterfall and stem growth (ANPP) did not differ between regions, both stem growth and the ratio of stem growth to litterfall were higher in Paleotropical forests compared to Neotropical forests across the full observed range of ANPP. Greater C allocation to woody growth likely explains the much larger aboveground biomass estimates in Paleotropical forests (similar to 29%, or similar to 80 Mg DW/ha, greater than in the Neotropics). Climate was similar in Paleo- and Neotropical forests, thus the observed differences in C likely reflect differences in the evolutionary history of species and forest structure and function between regions. Our analysis suggests that Paleotropical forests, which can be dominated by tall-statured Dipterocarpaceae species, may be disproportionate hotspots for aboveground C storage. Land models typically treat these distinct tropical forests with differential structures as a single functional unit, but our findings suggest that this may overlook critical biogeographic variation in C storage potential among regions.

AB The relative role of density-dependent and density-independent variation in vital rates and population size remains largely unsolved. Despite its importance to the theory and application of population ecology, and to conservation biology, quantifying the role and strength of density dependence is particularly challenging. We present a hierarchical formulation of the temporal symmetry approach, also known as the Pradel model, that permits estimation of the strength of density dependence from capture-mark-reencounter data. A measure of relative population size is built in the model and serves to detect density dependence directly on population growth rate. The model is also extended to account for temporal random variability in demographic rates, allowing estimation of the temporal variance of population growth rate unexplained by density dependence. We thus present a model-based approach that enable to test and quantify the effect of density-dependent and density-independent factors affecting population fluctuations in a single modeling framework. More generally, we use this modeling framework along with simulated and empirical data to show the value of including density dependence when modeling individual encounter data without the need for auxiliary data.

AB The extent of young postfire conifer forests is growing throughout western North America as the frequency and size of high-severity fires increase, making it important to understand ecosystem structure and function in early seral forests. Understanding nitrogen (N) dynamics during postfire stand development is especially important because northern conifers are often N limited. We resampled lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) stands that regenerated naturally after the 1988 fires in Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming, USA) to ask (1) How have N pools and fluxes changed over a decade (15 to 25 yr postfire) of very rapid forest growth? (2) At postfire year 25, how do N pools and fluxes vary with lodgepole pine density and productivity? Lodgepole pine foliage, litter (annual litterfall, forest-floor litter), and mineral soils were sampled in 14 plots (0.25 ha) that varied in postfire lodgepole pine density (1,500 to 344,000 stems/ha) and aboveground net primary production (ANPP; 1.4 to 16.1 Mg center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1)). Counter to expectation, foliar N concentrations in lodgepole pine current-year and composite needles (1.33 and 1.11% N, respectively) had not changed over time. Further, all measured ecosystem N pools increased substantially: foliar N increased to 89 kg N/ha (+93%), O-horizon N increased to 39 kg N/ha (+38%), and mineral soil percent total N (0-15 cm) increased to 0.08% (+33%). Inorganic N availability also increased to 0.69 mu g N center dot[g resin](-1)center dot d(-1) (+165%). Thus, soil N did not decline as live biomass N pools increased. Among stands, biomass N pools at postfire year 25 remained strongly influenced by early postfire tree density: foliar and litterfall N concentrations declined with lodgepole pine density and ANPP, but the foliar N pool increased. Lodgepole pine ANPP correlated negatively with annual resin-sorbed N, and we found no indication of widespread N limitation. The large increases in N pools cannot be explained by atmospheric N deposition or presence of known N fixers. These results suggest an unmeasured N source and are consistent with recent reports of N fixation in young lodgepole pine.

AB Intraguild predation (IGP), that is, feeding interaction between two consumers that share the same resource species, is commonly observed in natural food webs. IGP expands vertical niche space and slows down energy flows from lower to higher trophic levels, which potentially affects the diversity and dynamics of food webs. Here, we use food-web models to investigate the effects of IGP on species diversity and ecosystem functioning. We first simulate a five-species food-web module with different strengths of IGP at the herbivore and/or carnivore level. Results show that as the strength of IGP within a trophic level increases, the biomass of its resource level increases because of predation release; this increased biomass in turn alters the energy fluxes and biomass of other trophic levels. These results are then extended by subsequent simulations of more diverse food webs. As the strength of IGP increases, simulated food webs maintain (1) higher species diversity at different trophic levels, (2) higher total biomasses at different trophic levels, and (3) larger energy fluxes across trophic levels. Our results challenge the intuitive hypothesis that food-web structure should maximize the efficiency of energy transfer across trophic levels; instead, they suggest that the assembly of food webs should be governed by a balance between efficiency (of energy transfer) and persistence (i.e., the maintenance of species and biomasses). Our simulations also show that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (e.g., total biomass or primary production) is much stronger in the presence of IGP, reconciling the contrast from recent studies based on food-chain and food-web models. Our findings shed new light on the functional role of IGP and contribute to resolving the debate on structure, diversity and functioning in complex food webs.

AB Emerging infectious diseases increasingly threaten wildlife populations. Most studies focus on managing short-term epidemic properties, such as controlling early outbreaks. Predicting long-term endemic characteristics with limited retrospective data is more challenging. We used individual-based modeling informed by individual variation in pathogen load and transmissibility to predict long-term impacts of a lethal, transmissible cancer on Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) populations. For this, we employed approximate Bayesian computation to identify model scenarios that best matched known epidemiological and demographic system properties derived from 10 yr of data after disease emergence, enabling us to forecast future system dynamics. We show that the dramatic devil population declines observed thus far are likely attributable to transient dynamics (initial dynamics after disease emergence). Only 21% of matching scenarios led to devil extinction within 100 yr following devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) introduction, whereas DFTD faded out in 57% of simulations. In the remaining 22% of simulations, disease and host coexisted for at least 100 yr, usually with long-period oscillations. Our findings show that pathogen extirpation or host-pathogen coexistence are much more likely than the DFTD-induced devil extinction, with crucial management ramifications. Accounting for individual-level disease progression and the long-term outcome of devil-DFTD interactions at the population-level, our findings suggest that immediate management interventions are unlikely to be necessary to ensure the persistence of Tasmanian devil populations. This is because strong population declines of devils after disease emergence do not necessarily translate into long-term population declines at equilibria. Our modeling approach is widely applicable to other host-pathogen systems to predict disease impact beyond transient dynamics.

AB Sodium (Na) has a unique role in food webs as a nutrient primarily limiting for plant consumers, but not other trophic levels. Environmental Na levels vary with proximity to coasts, local geomorphology, climate, and with anthropogenic inputs (e.g., road salt). We tested two key predictions across 54 grasslands in North America: Na shortfall commonly limits herbivore abundance, and the magnitude of this limitation varies inversely with environmental Na supplies. We tested them with a distributed pulse experiment and evaluated the relative importance of Na limitation to other classic drivers of climate, macronutrient levels, and plant productivity. Herbivore abundance increased by 45% with Na addition. Moreover, the magnitude of increase on Na addition plots decreased with increasing levels of plant Na, indicating Na satiation at sites with high Na concentrations in plant tissue. Our results demonstrate that invertebrate primary consumers are often Na limited and track local Na availability, with implications for the geography of invertebrate abundance and herbivory.

AB In some insect nursery pollination mutualisms, plant hosts impose net costs to uncooperative "cheater" symbionts. These "sanctions" promote mutualism stability but their precise adaptive nature remains unclear. In fig-wasp mutualisms host trees (Ficus spp.) are only pollinated by female agaonid wasps whose larvae only use galled fig flowers as food. In actively pollinated systems, if wasps fail to pollinate, sanctions can result via fig abortion, killing all wasp offspring, or by increased offspring mortality within un-aborted figs. These sanctions result from selective investment to pollinated inflorescences, a mechanism present in almost all angiosperms. To more fully understand how selective investment functions as sanctions requires the measurement of variation in their costs and benefits to both hosts and symbionts. Gynodioecious fig-tree-fig-wasp mutualisms are particularly suitable for this because pollen and wasps are produced only in the figs of "male" trees and seeds only in the figs of "female" trees. Male and female trees thus incur different net costs of pollen absence, and costs of sanctions to pollen-free "cheater" wasps only occur in male trees. We used the actively pollinated host tree Ficus hispida and introduced into male and female figs either 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 all pollen-laden "cooperative" (P+) or all pollen-free "cheater" (P-) wasps. Abortion in both male and female trees was highest in P- figs, with P- fig abortion higher in females (similar to 90%) than in males (similar to 40%). Fig abortion was negatively associated with foundress number mainly in P+ figs; in P- figs abortion was only weakly associated with the number of "cheater" wasps, especially in female figs. In un-aborted male figs, wasp offspring mortality was higher in P- figs than in P+ figs, and in P- figs correlated positively with foundress (cheater) number. Increased offspring mortality was biased against female wasp offspring and likely resulted from reduced larval nutrition in unpollinated flowers. Variation in selective investment to P- figs thus reflects costs and benefits of pollen absence/presence to hosts, variation that translates directly to net costs to cheater wasps.

AB Research on regime shifts has focused primarily on how changes in the intensity and duration of press disturbances precipitate natural systems into undesirable, alternative states. By contrast, the role of recurrent pulse perturbations, such as extreme climatic events, has been largely neglected, hindering our understanding of how historical processes regulate the onset of a regime shift. We performed field manipulations to evaluate whether combinations of extreme events of temperature and sediment deposition that differed in their degree of temporal clustering generated alternative states in rocky intertidal epilithic microphytobenthos (biofilms) on rocky shores. The likelihood of biofilms to shift from a vegetated to a bare state depended on the degree of temporal clustering of events, with biofilm biomass showing both states under a regime of non-clustered (60 d apart) perturbations while collapsing in the clustered (15 d apart) scenario. Our results indicate that time since the last perturbation can be an important predictor of collapse in systems exhibiting alternative states and that consideration of historical effects in studies of regime shifts may largely improve our understanding of ecosystem dynamics under climate change.

ID INFORMATION; MODEL
AB Spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models have emerged as one solution to the problem of estimating the population density of mobile and cryptic animals. Spatial models embody assumptions regarding the spatial distribution of individuals and the spatial detection process. The detection process is modeled in SECR as a radial decline in detection probability with distance from the activity center of each individual. This would seem to require that home ranges are circular. The robustness of SECR when home ranges are not circular has been the subject of conflicting statements. Ivan et al. previously compared the SECR density estimator to a telemetry-scaled non-spatial estimator. I suggest that the apparent non-robustness of SECR in their study was a simulation artefact. New simulations of elliptical home ranges establish that the SECR density estimator is largely robust to non-circularity when detectors are spread in two dimensions, but may be very biased if the detector array is linear and home ranges align with the array. Transformation to isotropy reduces bias from designs of intermediate dimension, such as hollow square arrays. Possible alignment of home ranges should be considered when designing detector arrays.

AB In semiarid regions, vegetation constraints on plant growth responses to precipitation (PPT) are hypothesized to place an upper limit on net primary productivity (NPP), leading to predictions of future shifts from currently defined linear to saturating NPP-PPT relationships as increases in both dry and wet PPT extremes occur. We experimentally tested this prediction by imposing a replicated gradient of growing season PPT (GSP, n = 11 levels, n = 4 replicates), ranging from the driest to wettest conditions in the 75-yr climate record, within a semiarid grassland. We focused on responses of two key ecosystem processes: aboveground NPP (ANPP) and soil respiration (R-s). ANPP and R-s both exhibited greater relative responses to wet vs. dry GSP extremes, with a linear relationship consistently best explaining the response of both processes to GSP. However, this responsiveness to GSP peaked at moderate levels of extremity for both processes, and declined at the most extreme GSP levels, suggesting that greater sensitivity of ANPP and R-s to wet vs. dry conditions may diminish under increased magnitudes of GSP extremes. Underlying these responses was rapid plant compositional change driven by increased forb production and cover as GSP transitioned to extreme wet conditions. This compositional shift increased the magnitude of ANPP responses to wet GSP extremes, as well as the slope and variability explained in the ANPP-GSP relationship. Our findings suggest that rapid plant compositional change may act as a mediator of semiarid ecosystem responses to predicted changes in GSP extremes.

AB The risk of ecosystem function degradation with biodiversity loss has emerged as a major scientific concern in recent years. Possible relationships between taxonomic diversity and magnitude and stability of ecosystem processes build upon species' functional characteristics, which determine both susceptibility to environmental change and contribution to ecosystem properties. The functional diversity within communities thus provides a potential buffer against environmental disturbance, especially for properties emerging from interactions among species. In complex plant-pollinator networks, distantly related taxa spanning a great trait diversity shape network architecture. Here, we address the question of whether network properties are maintained after habitat loss by complementary contributions of phylogenetically distant pollinator taxa. We quantified contributions of wild bees and hoverflies to network structure (connectance, network specialization, specialization asymmetry) in 32 calcareous grassland fragments varying in size. Although hoverflies are often regarded less susceptible to environmental change than wild bees, species richness of both taxa was similarly affected by habitat loss. The associated loss of 80% of interactions resulted in small and tightly connected networks, which was more strongly attributed to wild bee loss than hoverfly loss. Networks in small fragments were less specialized due to equivalent losses of species and interactions in both pollinators and plants. Because wild bee and hoverfly loss contributed similarly to declining network specialization, we conclude that trait diversity among distantly related pollinators does not necessarily provide insurance against functional homogenization during community disassembly following habitat loss.

AB Sea urchin grazing can result in regime shift from productive kelp beds to sea urchin barren grounds that represent an alternative and stable reef state. Here we examine the stability of urchin barrens by defining the demographics of the Australian urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma during regime shift to, and maintenance of, barrens. Inverse-logistic modeling of calibrated in situ annual growth increments for five urchin populations, two from kelp beds and three from barrens, demonstrate slowing of urchin growth as availability and consumption of standing and/or drift kelp declines. Population age structures were predicted from observed sizes over four years (2012-2015, n = 5,864 individuals), which indicated stable age distributions for populations both maintaining barrens and actively grazing among kelp beds. Younger age distributions occurred on barrens whereas more mature populations existed within kelp beds, indicating that high recruitment facilitates maintenance of barrens while overgrazing appeared more reliant on adult urchins grazing from the edges of kelp beds, as opposed to juvenile recruitment among kelp. Leslie-matrix projections indicated potential for unchecked population growth for all study populations, but which varied depending on whether local or regional recruitment rates were modeled. Ultimately, strong density dependence was observed to check population growth; with high-recruitment/high-density populations offset by reduced growth rates and decreased longevity. Increasing disease rates among older urchins in high-density populations were consistent with observed density-dependent mortality, while tethering of healthy urchins revealed highest predation on small urchins within kelp beds, suggesting some remnant resilience of declining kelp habitat. Results demonstrate that the greatest opportunity for urchin population control is when reefs exist in the kelp bed state, at which point urchin populations are prone to negative feedback. Conversely, control of urchins on barrens is demonstrably difficult given positive density-dependent feedbacks that act to stabilize population size and which evidently underpin the hysteresis effect governing the persistence of this alternative stable state.

AB Alpine biomes are climate change hotspots, and treeline dynamics in particular have received much attention as visible evidence of climate-induced shifts in species distributions. Comparatively little is known, however, about the effects of climate change on alpine shrubline dynamics. Here, we reconstruct decadally resolved shrub recruitment history (age structure) through the combination of field surveys and dendroecology methods at the world's highest juniper (Juniperus pingii var. wilsonii) shrublines on the south-central Tibetan Plateau. A total of 1,899 shrubs were surveyed at 12 plots located in four regions along an east-to-west declining precipitation gradient. We detected synchronous recruitment with 9 out of 12 plots showing a gradual increase from 1600 to 1900, a peak at 1900-1940, and a subsequent decrease from the 1930s onward. Shrub recruitment was significantly and positively correlated with reconstructed summer temperature from 1600 to 1940, whereas it was negatively associated with temperature in recent decades (1930-2000). Recruitment was also positively correlated with precipitation, except in the 1780-1830 period, when a trend toward wetter climate conditions began. Warming-induced drought limitation has likely reduced the recruitment potential of alpine juniper shrubs in recent decades. Ongoing warming without a simultaneous increase in precipitation is expected to further impair recruitment at the world's highest juniper shrublines and alter the dynamics and competitive balance between woody plant species throughout these alpine biomes.

AB The effects of environmental seasonality on food web structure have been notoriously understudied in empirical ecology. Here, we focus on seasonal changes in one key attribute of a food web, consumer trophic position. We ask whether fishes inhabiting tropical river-floodplain ecosystems behave as seasonal omnivores, by shifting their trophic positions in relation to the annual flood pulse, or whether they feed at the same trophic position all year, as much empirical work implicitly assumes. Using dietary data from the Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia, and a literature review, we find evidence that some fishes, especially small piscivores, increased consumption of invertebrates and/or plant material during the wet season, as predicted. However, nitrogen stable isotope (delta N-15) data for 26 Tonle Sap fishes, spanning a broader range of functional groups, uncovered high variation in seasonal trophic position responses among species (0 to +/- 0.52 trophic positions). Based on these findings, species respond to the flood pulse differently. Diverse behavioral responses to seasonality, underpinned by spatiotemporal variation at multiple scales, could be central for rerouting matter and energy flow in these dynamic ecosystems. Seasonally flexible foraging behaviors warrant further study given their potential influence on food web dynamics in a range of fluctuating environments.

AB Asymmetric interactions among conspecifics can have diverse effects on population dynamics including stabilization, generation of cycles, and induction of chaotic fluctuations. A difficult challenge, however, is establishing the link between the impact of asymmetric interactions on life history and the consequences for population dynamics. The smaller tea tortrix, Adoxophyes honmai, is a good example. Larval instars differ dramatically in size and have a tendency for cannibalism, which suggests the potential for strong asymmetric interactions among instars. Yet whether these asymmetries have any role in generating the distinct single-generation cycles observed in the field and laboratory is unclear. Here we report on the development of a new experimental approach to characterize the impact of asymmetric interactions on life history that can be directly embedded into stage-structured population models. The experiments use donor-replacement protocols in which focal individuals are challenged to complete their life cycles in competitive environments where the instar and density of the competitors are held constant. The experimentally derived interaction surface contains all the information about stage-specific interactions and provides a straightforward framework for evaluating alternative ways of abstracting the interactions into traditional models of asymmetric competition. Working with the smaller tea tortrix, we found strong evidence of asymmetric interactions and identified critical "tipping points" in the competitive environment that strongly affected survival but not development. We incorporated the experimentally derived interaction surface into a stage-structured population model and found that despite the strong impact that asymmetric interactions have on tea tortrix life history, they do not scale-up to impact the predicted asymptotic population dynamics. Comparing these dynamics with two abstracted models of stage-structured interactions revealed that while the quantitative details of the emergent dynamics depends on the shape of the interaction surface, the qualitative features, such as the emergence of single-generation cycles and rapid synchronization of development among individuals, are pleasingly robust.

AB Multiple abrupt and sometimes near-synchronous declines in tree populations have been detected in the temperate forests of eastern North America and Europe during the Holocene. Traditional approaches to understanding these declines focus on searching for climatic or other broad-scale extrinsic drivers. These approaches include multi-proxy studies that match reconstructed changes in tree abundance to reconstructed changes in precipitation or temperature. Although these correlative approaches are informative, they neglect the potential role of intrinsic processes, such as competition and dispersal, in shaping tree community dynamics. We developed a simple process-based community model that includes competition among tree species, density-dependent survival, and dispersal to investigate how these processes might generate abrupt changes in tree abundances even when extrinsic climatic factors do not themselves change abruptly. Specifically, a self-reinforcing (i.e., positive) feedback between abundance and survival can produce abrupt changes in tree abundance in the absence of long-term climatic changes. Furthermore, spatially correlated, short-term environmental variation and seed dispersal can increase the synchrony of abrupt changes. Using the well-studied, late-Holocene crash of Tsuga canadensis (eastern hemlock) populations as an empirical case study, we find that our model generates abrupt and quasi-synchronized crashes qualitatively similar to the observed hemlock patterns. Other tree taxa vary in the frequency and clustering of abrupt change and the proportion of increases and decreases. This complexity argues for caution in interpreting abrupt changes in species abundances as indicative of abrupt climatic changes. Nonetheless, some taxa show patterns that the model cannot produce: observed abrupt declines in hemlock abundance are more synchronized than abrupt increases, whereas the degree of synchronization is the same for abrupt decreases and increases in the model. Our results show that intrinsic processes can be significant contributing factors in abrupt tree population changes and highlight the diagnostic value of analyzing entire time series rather than single events when testing hypotheses about abrupt changes. Thus, intrinsic processes should be considered along with extrinsic drivers when seeking to explain rapid changes in community composition.

AB The diversity-invasibility hypothesis and ecological theory predict that high-diversity communities should be less easily invaded than species-poor communities, but empirical evidence does not consistently support this prediction. While fine-scale experiments tend to yield the predicted negative association between diversity and invasibility, broad-scale observational surveys generally report a positive correlation. This conflicting pattern between experiments and observational studies is referred to as the invasion paradox and is thought to arise because different processes control species composition at different spatial scales. Here, we test empirically the extent to which the strength and direction of published diversity-invasibility relationships depend on spatial scale and on the metrics used to measure invasibility. Using a meta-analytic framework, we explicitly separate the two components of spatial scale: grain and extent, by focusing on fine-grain studies that vary in extent. We find evidence of multiple drivers of the paradox. When we consider only fine-grain studies, we still observe conflicting patterns between experiments and observational studies. In contrast, when we examine studies that are conducted at both a fine grain and fine extent, there is broad overlap in effect sizes between experiments and observation, suggesting that comparing studies with similar extents resolves the paradox at local scales. However, we uncover systematic differences in the metrics used to measure invasibility between experiments, which use predominantly invader performance, and observational studies, which use mainly invader richness. When we consider studies with the same metric (i.e., invader performance), the contrasting associations between study types also disappear. It is not possible, at present, to fully disentangle the effect of spatial extent and metric on the paradox because both variables are systematically associated in different directions with study type. There is therefore an urgent need to conduct experiments and observational studies that incorporate the full range of variability in spatial extent and invasibility metric.

AB Large-scale observational data from citizen science efforts are becoming increasingly common in ecology, and researchers often choose between these and data from intensive local-scale studies for their analyses. This choice has potential trade-offs related to spatial scale, observer variance, and interannual variability. Here we explored this issue with phenology by comparing models built using data from the large-scale, citizen science USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) effort with models built using data from more intensive studies at Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites. We built statistical and process based phenology models for species common to each data set. From these models, we compared parameter estimates, estimates of phenological events, and out-of-sample errors between models derived from both USA-NPN and LTER data. We found that model parameter estimates for the same species were most similar between the two data sets when using simple models, but parameter estimates varied widely as model complexity increased. Despite this, estimates for the date of phenological events and out-of-sample errors were similar, regardless of the model chosen. Predictions for USA-NPN data had the lowest error when using models built from the USA-NPN data, while LTER predictions were best made using LTER-derived models, confirming that models perform best when applied at the same scale they were built. This difference in the cross-scale model comparison is likely due to variation in phenological requirements within species. Models using the USA-NPN data set can integrate parameters over a large spatial scale while those using an LTER data set can only estimate parameters for a single location. Accordingly, the choice of data set depends on the research question. Inferences about species-specific phenological requirements are best made with LTER data, and if USA-NPN or similar data are all that is available, then analyses should be limited to simple models. Large-scale predictive modeling is best done with the larger-scale USA-NPN data, which has high spatial representation and a large regional species pool. LTER data sets, on the other hand, have high site fidelity and thus characterize inter-annual variability extremely well. Future research aimed at forecasting phenology events for particular species over larger scales should develop models that integrate the strengths of both data sets.

AB Most studies consider aboveground plant species richness as a representative biodiversity measure. This approach inevitably assumes that the partitioning of total plant species richness into above- and belowground components is constant or at least consistent within and across vegetation types. However, with studies considering belowground plant richness still scarce and completely absent along vegetation gradients, this assumption lacks experimental support. Novel DNA sequencing techniques allow economical, high-throughput species identification of belowground environmental samples, enabling the measurement of the contributions of both above- and belowground plant components to total plant richness. We investigated above- and belowground plant species richness in four vegetation types (birch forest, heath, low alpine tundra, high alpine tundra) at the scale of herbaceous plant neighborhoods (dm) using 454 sequencing of the chloroplast trnL (UAA) intron to determine the plant species richness of environmental root samples and combined it with aboveground data from vegetation surveys to obtain total plant species richness. We correlated the measured plant species richness components with each other and with their respective plant biomass components within and across vegetation types. Total plant species richness exceeded aboveground richness twice on average and by as much as three times in low alpine tundra, indicating that a significant fraction of belowground plant richness cannot be recorded aboveground. More importantly, no consistent relationship among richness components (above- and belowground) was found within or across vegetation types, indicating that aboveground richness alone cannot predict total plant richness in contrasting vegetation types. Finally, no consistent relationship between plant richness and the corresponding biomass component was found. Our results clearly show that aboveground plant richness alone is a poor estimator of total plant species richness within and across different vegetation types. Consequently, it is crucial to account for belowground plant richness in future plant ecological studies in order to validate currently accepted plant richness patterns, as well as to measure potential changes in plant community composition in a changing environment.

AB The abundance and distribution of species across the landscape depend on the interaction between local, spatial, and stochastic processes. However, empirical syntheses relating these processes to spatiotemporal patterns of structure in metacommunities remain elusive. One important reason for this lack of synthesis is that the relative importance of the core assembly processes (dispersal, selection, and drift) critically depends on the spatial grain and extent over which communities are studied. To illustrate this, we simulated different aspects of community assembly on heterogeneous landscapes, including the strength of response to environmental heterogeneity (inherent to niche theory) vs. dispersal and stochastic drift (inherent to neutral theory). We show that increasing spatial extent leads to increasing importance of niche selection, whereas increasing spatial grain leads to decreasing importance of niche selection. The strength of these scaling effects depended on environment configuration, dispersal capacity, and niche breadth. By mapping the variation observed from the scaling effects in simulations, we could recreate the entire range of variation observed within and among empirical studies. This means that variation in the relative importance of assembly processes among empirical studies is largely scale dependent and cannot be directly compared. The scaling coefficient of the relative contribution of assembly processes, however, can be interpreted as a scale-integrative estimate to compare assembly processes across different regions and ecosystems. This emphasizes the necessity to consider spatial scaling as an explicit component of studies intended to infer the importance of community assembly processes.

AB Disturbance such as wildfire may create opportunities for plant communities to reorganize in response to climate change. The interaction between climate change and disturbance may be particularly important in forests, where many of the foundational plant species (trees) are long-lived and where poor initial tree establishment can result in conversion to shrub- or graminoid-dominated systems. The response of post-disturbance vegetation establishment to post-disturbance weather conditions, particularly to extreme weather, could therefore provide useful information about how forest communities will respond to climate change. We examined the effect of post-fire weather conditions on post-fire tree, shrub, and graminoid recruitment in fire-adapted forests in northern California, USA, by surveying regenerating vegetation in severely burned areas 4-5 yr after 14 different wildfires that burned between 2004 and 2012. This time period (2004-2016) encompassed a wide range of post-fire weather conditions, including a period of extreme drought. For the most common tree species, we observed little evidence of disturbance-mediated community reorganization or range shifts but instead either (1) low sensitivity of recruitment to post-fire weather or (2) weak but widespread decreases in recruitment under unusually dry post-fire conditions, depending on the species. The occurrence of a single strong drought year following fire was more important than a series of moderately dry years in explaining tree recruitment declines. Overall, however, post-fire tree recruitment patterns were explained more strongly by long-term climate and topography and local adult tree species abundance than by post-fire weather conditions. This observation suggests that surviving adult trees can contribute to a "biological inertia" that restricts the extent to which tree community composition will track changes in climate through post-disturbance recruitment. In contrast to our observations in trees, we observed substantial increases in shrub and graminoid establishment under post-fire drought, suggesting that shifts in dominance between functional groups may become more likely in a future with more frequent and intense drought.

AB An enduring challenge for ecology is identifying the drivers of ecosystem and population stability. In a spatially explicit context, key features to consider are landscape spatial structure, local interactions, and dispersal. Substantial work has been done on each of these features as a driver of stability, but little is known on the interplay between them. Missing has been a more integrative approach, able to map and identify different dynamical regimes, predicting a system's response to perturbations. Here we first consider a simple scenario, i.e., the recovery of a homogeneous metapopulation from a single localized pulse disturbance. The analysis of this scenario reveals three fundamental recovery regimes: Isolated Regime when dispersal is not significant, Rescue Regime when dispersal mediates recovery, and Mixing Regime when perturbations spread throughout the system. Despite its simplicity, our approach leads to remarkably general predictions. These include the qualitatively different outcomes of various scenarios of habitat fragmentation, the surprising benefits of local extinctions on population persistence at the transition between regimes, and the productivity shifts of metacommunities in a changing environment. This study thus provides context to known results and insight into future directions of research.

AB In ecological systems, extremes can happen in time, such as population crashes, or in space, such as rapid range contractions. However, current methods for joint inference about temporal and spatial dynamics (e.g., spatiotemporal modeling with Gaussian random fields) may perform poorly when underlying processes include extreme events. Here we introduce a model that allows for extremes to occur simultaneously in time and space. Our model is a Bayesian predictive-process GLMM (generalized linear mixed-effects model) that uses a multivariate-t distribution to describe spatial random effects. The approach is easily implemented with our flexible R package glmmfields. First, using simulated data, we demonstrate the ability to recapture spatiotemporal extremes, and explore the consequences of fitting models that ignore such extremes. Second, we predict tree mortality from mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks in the U.S. Pacific Northwest over the last 16 yr. We show that our approach provides more accurate and precise predictions compared to traditional spatiotemporal models when extremes are present. Our R package makes these models accessible to a wide range of ecologists and scientists in other disciplines interested in fitting spatiotemporal GLMMs, with and without extremes.

AB Parasites, such as bacterial viruses (phages), can have large effects on host populations both at the ecological and evolutionary levels. In the case of cyanobacteria, phages can reduce primary production and infected hosts release intracellular nutrients influencing planktonic food web structure, community dynamics, and biogeochemical cycles. Cyanophages may be of great importance in aquatic food webs during large cyanobacterial blooms unless the host population becomes resistant to phage infection. The consequences on plankton community dynamics of the evolution of phage resistance in bloom forming cyanobacterial populations are still poorly studied. Here, we examined the effect of different frequencies of a phage-resistant genotype within a filamentous nitrogen-fixing Nodularia spumigena population on an experimental plankton community. Three Nodularia populations with different initial frequencies (0%, 5%, and 50%) of phage-resistant genotypes were inoculated in separate treatments with the phage 2AV2, the green alga Chlorella vulgaris, and the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis, which formed the experimental plankton community subjected to either nitrogen-limited or nitrogen-rich conditions. We found that the frequency of the phage-resistant Nodularia genotype determined experimental community dynamics. Cyanobacterial populations with a high frequency (50%) of the phage-resistant genotype dominated the cultures despite the presence of phages, retaining most of the intracellular nitrogen in the plankton community. In contrast, populations with low frequencies (0% and 5%) of the phage-resistant genotype were lysed and reduced to extinction by the phage, transferring the intracellular nitrogen held by Nodularia to Chlorella and rotifers, and allowing Chlorella to dominate the communities and rotifers to survive. This study shows that even though phages represent minuscule biomass, they can have key effects on community composition and eco-evolutionary feedbacks in plankton communities.

AB Primates play an important role in ecosystem functioning and offer critical insights into human evolution, biology, behavior, and emerging infectious diseases. There are 26 primate species in the Atlantic Forests of South America, 19 of them endemic. We compiled a dataset of 5,472 georeferenced locations of 26 native and 1 introduced primate species, as hybrids in the genera Callithrix and Alouatta. The dataset includes 700 primate communities, 8,121 single species occurrences and 714 estimates of primate population sizes, covering most natural forest types of the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Forest of Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina and some other biomes. On average, primate communities of the Atlantic Forest harbor 2 +/- 1 species (range = 1-6). However, about 40% of primate communities contain only one species. Alouatta guariba (N = 2,188 records) and Sapajus nigritus (N = 1,127) were the species with the most records. Callicebus barbarabrownae (N = 35), Leontopithecus caissara (N = 38), and Sapajus libidinosus (N = 41) were the species with the least records. Recorded primate densities varied from 0.004 individuals/km(2) (Alouatta guariba at Fragmento do Bugre, Parana, Brazil) to 400 individuals/km(2) (Alouatta caraya in Santiago, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil). Our dataset reflects disparity between the numerous primate census conducted in the Atlantic Forest, in contrast to the scarcity of estimates of population sizes and densities. With these data, researchers can develop different macroecological and regional level studies, focusing on communities, populations, species co-occurrence and distribution patterns. Moreover, the data can also be used to assess the consequences of fragmentation, defaunation, and disease outbreaks on different ecological processes, such as trophic cascades, species invasion or extinction, and community dynamics. There are no copyright restrictions. Please cite this Data Paper when the data are used in publications. We also request that researchers and teachers inform us of how they are using the data.

AB We propose an operational definition of soil "fertility" that is applicable to plant community ecology and develop a method of measuring and quantifying it, using structural equations modeling, that is generalizable to soils in different regions whose fertility has different causes. To do this, we used structural equation modeling (SEM). The measurement submodel predicts the latent "generalized fertility," F-G, of a soil using four indicator variables: the relative growth rates of Festuca rubra, Trifolium pratense, Triticum aestivum, and Arabidopsis thaliana. The direct causes of F-G in this study were the supply rates of NO3-, P, and K as well as three indirect causes consisting of three physical soil properties, but these can change between studies. The model was calibrated using 76 grassland soils from southern Quebec, Canada and independently tested using aboveground net primary productivity (NPP) of the natural vegetation over two growing seasons. Both the measurement submodel and the full SEM fit the data well. The F-G values predicted 51% of the variance in NPP and were a better predictor than any other single variable, including the actual nutrient flux rates. Furthermore, this model can be applied to grassland soils anywhere because of its modular nature in which the causes and effects of soil fertility are clearly separated.

AB The Metabolic Theory of Ecology (MTE) posits that metabolic rate controls ecological processes, such as the rate of resource uptake, from the individual- to the ecosystem-scale. Metabolic rate has been found empirically to be an exponential function of whole organism body mass. We test a fundamental assumption of MTE, whether resource uptake scales to metabolism, by examining detritivores accessing a single common resource pool, an ideal study case. We used an existing empirical model of ingestion for aquatic deposit feeders adjusted for temperature to test whether ingestion by abyssal deposit feeders conforms to MTE-predicted feeding rates. We estimated the sediment deposit-feeding rates of large invertebrates from two abyssal study sites using time-lapse photography, and related those rates to body mass, environmental temperature, and sediment organic matter content using this framework. Ingestion was significantly related to individual wet mass, with a mass-scaling coefficient of 0.81, with 95% confidence intervals that encompass the MTE-predicted value of 0.75, and the same pattern determined in other aquatic systems. Our results also provide insight into the potential mechanism through which this fundamental assumption operates. After temperature correction, both deep- and shallow-water taxa might be summarized into a single mass-scaled ingestion rate.

AB A plant's induction of secondary defenses helps to decrease herbivore damage by changing resource quality. While these chemical or physical defenses may directly decrease herbivory, they can also have indirect consequences. In a tritrophic system consisting of a plant, an insect herbivore, and an insect pathogen, plant based trait-mediated indirect effects (TMIEs) can alter host-pathogen interactions and, thereby, indirectly affect disease transmission. In a series of field experiments, individual soybean plants (Glycine max) were sprayed with either a jasmonic acid (JA) solution to trigger induction of plant defenses or a similar control compound. Fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) larvae along with varying amounts of a lethal baculovirus were placed on the plants to measure transmission. Induction of plant defenses decreased viral transmission due to increased population heterogeneity arising from changes in individual susceptibility. The change in susceptibility via TMIEs was driven by a decrease in feeding rates and an increase viral dose needed to infect larvae. While the induction against herbivore attack may decrease herbivory, it can also decrease the efficacy of the herbivore's pathogen potentially to the plant's detriment. While TMIEs have been well-recognized for being driven by top-down forces, bottom-up interactions can dictate community dynamics and, here, epizootic severity.

AB Flower signaling and orientation are key characteristics that determine a flower's pollinator guild. However, many flowers actively move during their daily cycle, changing both their detectability and accessibility to pollinators. The flowers of the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata orientate their corolla upward at sunset and downward after sunrise. Here, we investigated the effect of different flower orientations on a major pollinator of N. attenuata, the hawkmoth Manduca sexta. We found that although flower orientation influenced the flight altitude of the moth in respect to the flower, it did not alter the moth's final flower choice. These behavioral observations were consistent with the finding that orientation did not systematically change the spatial distribution of floral volatiles, which are major attractants for the moths. Moreover, hawkmoths invested the same amount of time into probing flowers at different orientations, even though they were only able to feed and gather pollen from horizontally and upward-oriented flowers, but not from downward-facing flowers. The orientation of the flower was hence crucial for a successful interaction between N. attenuata and its hawkmoth pollinator. Additionally, we also investigated potential adverse effects of exposing flowers at different orientations to natural daylight levels, finding that anther temperature of upward-oriented flowers was more than 7 degrees C higher than for downward-oriented flowers. This increase in temperature likely caused the significantly reduced germination success that was observed for pollen grains from upward-oriented flowers in comparison to those of downward and horizontally oriented flowers. These results highlight the importance of flower reorientation to balance pollen protection and a successful interaction of the plant with its insect pollinators by maintaining the association between flower volatiles and flower accessibility to the pollinator.

AB Prolonged droughts exacerbated by climate change have been widely documented to interact with consumers to decimate vegetation in many ecosystems. Although climate change is increasing within-year variation in precipitation and temperature, how weather fluctuations affect the impact of consumers on vegetation processes remains poorly understood. In a salt marsh that has recently experienced drought-associated vegetation die-off, we investigated how top-down control of plant recovery by a prominent salt marsh grazer varies with weather. Our results showed that grazing-driven plant mortality varied strongly with weather in spring, with intense grazing occurring during cool, wet days immediately following rain. Intense grazing on cool, wet days across the generally dry spring season had a strong impact that eliminated plant seedlings that could otherwise have become tolerant of grazing in the following summer, thereby restricting vegetation recovery and contributing to the persistence of an unvegetated salt barren state. Thus, weather fluctuations can modulate the impact of consumers on vegetation recovery, a fundamental process underlying the fate of ecosystems after disturbances. A multi-timescale perspective on top-down control that combines the impact of short-term fluctuations in weather and that of long-term variation in mean climate can not only help understand ecosystem dynamics in an increasingly variable climate, but may also inform conservation strategies or recovery plans for ecosystems that are already lost to climate change.

AB Like many species, movement patterns of southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) are being influenced by long-term environmental change. These seals migrate up to 4,000 km from their breeding colonies, foraging for months in a variety of Southern Ocean habitats. Understanding how movement patterns vary with environmental features and how these relationships differ among individuals employing different foraging strategies can provide insight into foraging performance at a population level. We apply new fast-estimation tools to fit mixed effects within a random walk movement model, rapidly inferring among-individual variability in southern elephant seal environment-movement relationships. We found that seals making foraging trips to the sea ice on or near the Antarctic continental shelf consistently reduced speed and directionality (move persistence) with increasing sea-ice coverage but had variable responses to chlorophyll a concentration, whereas seals foraging in the open ocean reduced move persistence in regions where circumpolar deep water shoaled. Given future climate scenarios, open-ocean foragers may encounter more productive habitat but sea-ice foragers may see reduced habitat availability. Our approach is scalable to large telemetry data sets and allows flexible combinations of mixed effects to be evaluated via model selection, thereby illuminating the ecological context of animal movements that underlie habitat usage.

AB Population viability analysis (PVA) uses concepts from theoretical ecology to provide a powerful tool for quantitative estimates of population dynamics and extinction risks. However, conventional statistical PVA requires long-term data from every population of interest, whereas many species of concern exist in multiple isolated populations that are only monitored occasionally. We present a hierarchical multi-population viability analysis model that increases inference power from sparse data by sharing information among populations to assess extinction risks while accounting for incomplete detection and sampling biases with explicit observation and sampling sub-models. We present a case study in which we customized this model for historical population monitoring data (1985-2015) from federally threatened Lahontan cutthroat trout populations in the Great Basin, USA. Data were counts of fish captured during backpack electrofishing surveys from locations associated with 155 isolated populations. Some surveys (25%) included multi-pass removal sampling, which provided valuable information about capture efficiency. GIS and remote sensing were used to estimate August stream temperatures, peak flows, and riparian vegetation condition in each population each year. Field data were used to derive an annual index of nonnative trout densities. Results indicated that population growth rates were higher in colder streams and that nonnative trout reduced carrying capacities of native trout. Extinction risks increased with more environmental stochasticity and were also related to population extent, water temperatures, and nonnative densities. We developed a graphical user interface to interact with the fitted model results and to simulate future habitat scenarios and management actions to assess their influence on extinction risks in each population. Hierarchical multi-population viability analysis bridges the gap between site-level field observations and population-level processes, making effective use of existing datasets to support management decisions with robust estimates of population dynamics, extinction risks, and uncertainties.

AB The seasonal cycle varies geographically and organisms are under selection to express life cycles that optimally exploit their spatiotemporal habitats. In insects, this often means producing an annual number of generations (voltinism) appropriate to the local season length. Variation in voltinism may arise from variation in environmental factors (e.g., temperature or photoperiod) acting on a single reaction norm shared across populations, but it may also result from local adaptation of reaction norms. However, such local adaptation is poorly explored at short geographic distances, especially within latitudes. Using a combination of common-garden rearing and life cycle modeling, we have investigated the causal factors behind voltinism variation in Swedish populations of the butterfly Pararge aegeria, focusing on a set of populations that lie within a single degree of latitude but nonetheless differ in season length and voltinism. Despite considerable differences in ambient temperature between populations, modeling suggested that the key determinant of local voltinism was in fact interpopulation differences in photoperiodic response. These include differences in the induction thresholds for winter diapause, as well as differences in photoperiodic regulation of larval development, a widespread but poorly studied phenomenon. Our results demonstrate previously neglected ways that photoperiodism may mediate insect phenological responses to temperature, and emphasize the importance of local adaptation in shaping phenological patterns in general, as well as for predicting the responses of populations to changes in climate.

AB The two dominant approaches for the analysis of species-habitat associations in animals have been shown to reach divergent conclusions. Models fitted from the viewpoint of an individual (step selection functions), once scaled up, do not agree with models fitted from a population viewpoint (resource selection functions [RSFs]). We explain this fundamental incompatibility, and propose a solution by introducing to the animal movement field a novel use for the well-known family of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. By design, the step selection rules of MCMC lead to a steady-state distribution that coincides with a given underlying function: the target distribution. We therefore propose an analogy between the movements of an animal and the movements of an MCMC sampler, to guarantee convergence of the step selection rules to the parameters underlying the population's utilization distribution. We introduce a rejection-free MCMC algorithm, the local Gibbs sampler, that better resembles real animal movement, and discuss the wide range of biological assumptions that it can accommodate. We illustrate our method with simulations on a known utilization distribution, and show theoretically and empirically that locations simulated from the local Gibbs sampler give rise to the correct RSF. Using simulated data, we demonstrate how this framework can be used to estimate resource selection and movement parameters.

AB Support for the "biotic resistance hypothesis," that species-rich communities are more successful at resisting invasion by exotic species than are species-poor communities, has long been debated. It has been argued that native-exotic richness relationships (NERR) are negative at small spatial scales and positive at large scales, but evidence for the role of spatial scale on NERR has been contradictory. However, no formal quantitative synthesis has previously examined whether NERR is scale-dependent across multiple studies, and previous studies on NERR have not distinguished spatial grain and extent, which may drive very different ecological processes. We used a global systematic review and hierarchical mixed-effects meta-analysis to provide a comprehensive quantitative assessment of the patterns of NERR over a range of spatial grain sizes and spatial extents, based on 204 individual cases of observational (non-experimental) NERRs from 101 publications. We show that NERR was indeed highly scale dependent across studies and increased with the log of grain size. However, mean NERR was not negative at any grain size, although there was high heterogeneity at small grain sizes. We found no clear patterns of NERR across different spatial extents, suggesting that extent plays a less important role in determining NERR than does grain, although there was a complex interaction between extent and grain size. Almost all studies on NERR were conducted in North America, western Europe, and a few other regions, with little information on tropical or Arctic regions. We did find that NERR increased northward in temperate regions and also varied with longitude. We discuss possible explanations for the patterns we found, and caution that our results do not show that invasive species are benign or have no negative consequences for biodiversity preservation. This study represents the first global quantitative analysis of scale-based NERR, and casts doubt on the existence of an "invasion paradox" of negative NERR at small scales and positive correlations at large scales in non-experimental studies.

AB Along elevational gradients, species richness often peaks at intermediate elevations and not the base. Here we refine and test eight hypotheses to evaluate causes of a richness peak in trees of the eastern Himalaya. In the field, we enumerated trees in 50 plots of size 0.1 ha each at eight zones along an elevational gradient and compared richness patterns with interpolation of elevational ranges of species from a thorough review of literature, including floras from the plains of India. The maximum number of species peaks at similar elevations in the two data sets (at 500 m in the field sampling and between 500 m and 1,000 m in range interpolation); concordance between the methods implies that statistical artefacts are unlikely to explain the peak in the data. We reject most hypotheses (e.g., area, speciation rate, mixing of distinct floras). We find support for a model in which climate (actual evapotranspiration [AET] or its correlates) sets both the number of species and each species optimum, coupled with a geometric constraint. We consider that AET declines with elevation, but an abrupt change in the association of AET with geographical distance into the plains means that the location of highest AET, at the base of the mountain, receives range overlaps from fewer species than the location just above the base. We formalize this explanation with a mathematical model to show how this can generate the observed low-elevation richness peak.

AB Habitat conversion and fragmentation threaten biodiversity and disrupt species interactions. While parasites are recognized as ecologically important, the impacts of fragmentation on parasitism are poorly understood relative to other species interactions. This lack of understanding is in part due to confounding landscape factors that accompany fragmentation. Fragmentation experiments provide the opportunity to fill this knowledge gap by mechanistically testing how fragmentation affects parasitism while controlling landscape factors. In a large-scale, long-term experiment, we asked how fragmentation affects a host-parasite interaction between a skink and a parasitic nematode, which is trophically transmitted via a terrestrial amphipod intermediate host. We expected that previously observed amphipod declines resulting from fragmentation would result in decreased transmission of nematodes to skinks. In agreement, we found that nematodes were absent among skinks in the cleared matrix and that infections in fragments were about one quarter of those in continuous forest. Amphipods found in gut contents of skinks and collected from pitfall traps mirrored this pattern. A structural equation model supported the expectation that fragmentation disrupted this interaction by altering the abundance of amphipods and suggested that other variables are likely also important in mediating this effect. These findings advance understanding of how landscape change affects parasitism.

AB Moonlight mediates trophic interactions and shapes the evolution of life-history strategies for nocturnal organisms. Reproductive cycles and important life-history transitions for many marine organisms coincide with moon phases, but few studies consider the effects of moonlight on pelagic larvae at sea. We evaluated effects of moonlight on growth of pelagic larvae of a temperate reef fish using "master chronologies" of larval growth constructed from age-independent daily increment widths recorded in otoliths of 321 individuals. We found that daily growth rates of fish larvae were enhanced by lunar illumination after controlling for the positive influence of temperature and the negative influence of cloud cover. Collectively, these results indicate that moonlight enhances growth rates of larval fish. This pattern is likely the result of moonlight's combined effects on foraging efficiency and suppression of diel migrations of mesopelagic predators, and has the potential to drive evolution of marine life histories.

AB Species composition and community structure in Neotropical forests have been severely affected by increases in climate change and disturbance. Among the most conspicuous changes is the proliferation of lianas. These increases have affected not only the carbon storage capacity of forests but also tree dynamics by reducing tree growth and increasing mortality. Despite the importance of lianas in Neotropical forests, most of the studies on lianas have focused on adult stages, ignoring dynamics at the seedlings stage. Here, we asked whether observed increases in liana abundance are associated with a demographic advantage that emerges early in liana ontogeny and with decreased precipitation and increased disturbance. To test this, we compared patterns of growth and survival between liana seedlings and tree seedlings using a long-term data set of seedling plots from a subtropical wet forest in Puerto Rico, USA. Then, we examined the effect of precipitation and land use history on these demographic variables. We found evidence for liana seedling survival advantage over trees, but no growth advantages. This survival advantage exhibited significant temporal variation linked with patterns of rainfall, as well as differences associated with land-use history in the study area. Furthermore, we found that neighborhood density has a negative effect on liana survival and growth. Our results indicate that liana proliferation is likely related to a survival advantage that emerges in early stages and is influenced by climatic conditions and past disturbance. Predicted climatic changes in rainfall patterns, including more frequent and severe droughts, together with increases in disturbance, could have a significant effect on seedling tropical communities by favoring lianas.

AB This dataset provides the Global Naturalized Alien Flora (GloNAF) database, version 1.2. GloNAF represents a data compendium on the occurrence and identity of naturalized alien vascular plant taxa across geographic regions (e.g. countries, states, provinces, districts, islands) around the globe. The dataset includes 13,939 taxa and covers 1,029 regions (including 381 islands). The dataset is based on 210 data sources. For each taxon-by-region combination, we provide information on whether the taxon is considered to be naturalized in the specific region (i.e. has established self-sustaining populations in the wild). Non-native taxa are marked as "alien", when it is not clear whether they are naturalized. To facilitate alignment with other plant databases, we provide for each taxon the name as given in the original data source and the standardized taxon and family names used by The Plant List Version 1.1 (). We provide an ESRI shapefile including polygons for each region and information on whether it is an island or a mainland region, the country and the Taxonomic Databases Working Group (TDWG) regions it is part of (TDWG levels 1-4). We also provide several variables that can be used to filter the data according to quality and completeness of alien taxon lists, which vary among the combinations of regions and data sources. A previous version of the GloNAF dataset (version 1.1) has already been used in several studies on, for example, historical spatial flows of taxa between continents and geographical patterns and determinants of naturalization across different taxonomic groups. We intend the updated and expanded GloNAF version presented here to be a global resource useful for studying plant invasions and changes in biodiversity from regional to global scales. We release these data into the public domain under a Creative Commons Zero license waiver (). When you use the data in your publication, we request that you cite this data paper. If GloNAF is a major part of the data analyzed in your study, you should consider inviting the GloNAF core team (see Metadata S1: Originators in the Overall project description) as collaborators. If you plan to use the GloNAF dataset, we encourage you to contact the GloNAF core team to check whether there have been recent updates of the dataset, and whether similar analyses are already ongoing.

AB Plant enemies that attack chemically similar host species are thought to mediate competitive exclusion of chemically similar plants and select for chemical divergence among closely related species. This hypothesis predicts that plant defenses should diverge rapidly, minimizing phylogenetic signal. To evaluate this prediction, we quantified metabolomic similarity for 203 tree species that represent >89% of all individuals in large forest plots in Maryland and Panama. We constructed molecular networks based on mass spectrometry of all 203 species, quantified metabolomic similarity for all pairwise combinations of species, and used phylogenetically independent contrasts to evaluate how pairwise metabolomic similarity varies phylogenetically. Leaf metabolomes exhibited clear phylogenetic signal for the temperate plot, which is inconsistent with the prediction. In contrast, leaf metabolomes lacked phylogenetic signal for the tropical plot, with particularly low metabolomic similarity among congeners. In addition, community-wide variation in metabolomes was much greater for the tropical community, with single tropical genera supporting greater metabolomic variation than the entire temperate community. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that stronger plant-enemy interactions lead to more rapid divergence and greater metabolomic variation in tropical than temperate plants. Additional community-level foliar metabolomes will be required from tropical and temperate forests to evaluate this hypothesis.

AB Box Understanding how increasing human domination of the biosphere affects life on earth is a critical research challenge. This task is facilitated by the increasing availability of open-source data repositories, which allow ecologists to address scientific questions at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. Large datasets are mostly observational, so they may have limited ability to uncover causal relations among variables. Experiments are better suited at attributing causation, but they are often limited in scope. We propose hybrid datasets, resulting from the integration of observational with experimental data, as an approach to leverage the scope and ability to attribute causality in ecological studies. We show how the analysis of hybrid datasets with emerging techniques in time series analysis (Convergent Cross-mapping) and macroecology (Joint Species Distribution Models) can generate novel insights into causal effects of abiotic and biotic processes that would be difficult to achieve otherwise. We illustrate these principles with two case studies in marine ecosystems and discuss the potential to generalize across environments, species and ecological processes. If used wisely, the analysis of hybrid datasets may become the standard approach for research goals that seek causal explanations for large-scale ecological phenomena.

AB The fourth-corner analysis aims to quantify and test for relationships between species traits and site-specific environmental variables, mediated by site-specific species abundances. Since there is no common unit of observation, the significance of the relationships is tested using a double permutation procedure (site based and species based). This method implies that all species and sites are independent of each other. However, this fundamental hypothesis might be flawed because of phylogenetic relatedness between species and spatial autocorrelation in the environmental data. Here, using a simulation-based experiment, we demonstrate how the presence of spatial and phylogenetic autocorrelations can, in some circumstances, lead to inflated type I error rates, suggesting that significant associations can be misidentified. As an alternative, we propose a new randomization approach designed to avoid this issue, based on Moran's spectral randomization. In this approach, standard permutations are replaced by constrained randomizations so that the distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis is built with additional constraints to preserve the phylogenetic and spatial structures of the observed data. The inclusion of this new randomization approach provides total control over type I error rates and should be used in real studies where spatial and phylogenetic autocorrelations often occur.

AB Environmental variation can generate life-long similarities among individuals born in the same breeding event, so-called cohort effects. Studies of cohort effects have to account for the potentially confounding effects of current conditions (observation year) and age of individuals. However, estimation of such models is hampered by inherent collinearity, as age is the difference between observation year (period) and cohort year. The difficulties of separating linear trends in any of the three variables in Age-Period-Cohort (APC) models are the subject of ongoing debate in social sciences and medicine but have remained unnoticed in ecology. After reviewing the use of APC models, we investigate the consequences of model specification on the estimation of cohort effects, using both simulated data and empirical data from a long-term individual-based study of reindeer in Svalbard. We demonstrate that APC models are highly sensitive to the model's treatment of age, period and cohort, which may generate spurious temporal trends in cohort effects. Avoiding grouping ages and using environmental covariates believed to be drivers of temporal variation reduces the APC identification problem. Nonetheless, ecologists should use caution, given that the specification issues in APC models may have substantial impacts on estimated effect sizes and therefore conclusions.

AB Herbivore-plant interactions should be studied using a tri-trophic approach, but we lack a quantitative measure of the combined effect of top-down and bottom-up forces on herbivore fitness. We propose the combination of the bi-trophic fitness slopes as a tri-trophic fitness measure. We use the relationship between fitness associated with top-down and bottom-up forces and the frequency of host plant use to calculate the top-down and bottom-up fitness slopes, which we then combine to obtain three possible directions of tri-trophic slopes. A positive tri-trophic slope indicates that herbivores have overall greater tri-trophic fitness on the more frequently used hosts. A null tri-trophic fitness slope indicates that herbivores have similar fitness on all host plants. A negative tri-trophic slope indicates that herbivores have generally lower fitness on the more frequently used hosts. We tested the explanation power of our method using data from the literature that tested herbivore host shifts and experimentally using a generalist herbivore with variable diet breadth across populations. We found that in host shifts, herbivores have higher tri-trophic fitness on the novel host, while in generalist populations, herbivores use most frequently the best host available. We present applications in other research areas and consider the limitations of our approach. Our approach is a first step towards a comprehensive model of multiple selective forces acting on the evolution of interactions.

AB Understanding the interactive effects of species invasions and climate change is essential for predicting future shifts in biodiversity. Because multiple stressors can interact in synergistic or antagonistic ways, it is notoriously difficult to anticipate their combined effects on species assemblages. However, some hypotheses predict that plant invasions will become increasingly problematic as climate change improves conditions for invaders or lowers the biotic resistance of native communities. In a 4-yr field experiment, we quantified the individual and interactive effects of invasion by a globally problematic C-4 grass, Imperata cylindrica, and chronic simulated drought imposed by rainout shelters on the whole plant communities of regenerating longleaf pine forest. Invasion both inhibited plant colonization and enhanced plot-level extinctions, resulting in a severe (60%) loss of plant diversity across all functional groups, including perennial grasses and forbs, annual forbs, and woody species and dramatic shifts in community composition. Experimental drought reduced diversity by 20%, and caused a shift in the dominant functional groups, but had no significant effect on cover of the invader. The invader partially ameliorated water stress in the drought treatment such that invaded plots had higher soil moisture than uninvaded plots. Consequently, the combined effects of invasion and drought were lower than expected from an additive model of multiple stressors. These findings, which may have broader implications for how other C-4 grass invaders will interact with drought to shift native community dynamics, challenge the perception that climate change will exacerbate invasions. In revealing that invasive species pose a major threat to the diversity and structure of native communities despite their moderating effects on abiotic stress, this work also highlights that management of aggressive invaders may be critical to preserving biodiversity regardless of future climate.

AB Experimental tests of community assembly mechanisms for host-associated microbiomes in nature are lacking. Asymptomatic foliar fungal endophytes are a major component of the plant microbiome and are increasingly recognized for their impacts on plant performance, including pathogen defense, hormonal manipulation, and drought tolerance. However, it remains unclear whether fungal endophytes preferentially colonize certain host ecotypes or genotypes, reflecting some degree of biotic adaptation in the symbioses, or whether colonization is simply a function of spore type and abundance within the local environment. Whether host ecotype, local environment, or some combination of both controls the pattern of microbiome formation across hosts represents a new dimension to the age-old debate of nature versus nurture. Here, we used a reciprocal transplant design to explore the extent of host specificity and biotic adaptation in the plant microbiome, as evidenced by differential colonization of host genetic types by endophytes. Specifically, replicate plants from three locally-adapted ecotypes of the native grass Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) were transplanted at three geographically distinct field sites (one home and two away) in the Midwestern US. At the end of the growing season, plant leaves were harvested and the fungal microbiome characterized using culture-dependent sequencing techniques. Our results demonstrated that fungal endophyte community structure was determined by local environment (i.e., site), but not by host ecotype. Fungal richness and diversity also strongly differed by site, with lower fungal diversity at a riparian field site, whereas host ecotype had no effect. By contrast, there were significant differences in plant phenotypes across all ecotypes and sites, indicating ecotypic differentiation of host phenotype. Overall, our results indicate that environmental factors are the primary drivers of community structure in the switchgrass fungal microbiome.

AB Accounting for the variation that occurs within species in food webs can theoretically result in significant changes in both network structure and dynamics. However, there has been little work exploring their role with empirical data. In particular, the variation associated with species' life cycles, which is prevalent and represents both trait variation and taxonomic identity, has received little attention. Here, we characterize the structural consequences of life stage variation in five food webs, including a newly compiled web from the Arabian Gulf. We show that making life stage variation explicit in food webs results in larger food webs that possess consistent structural changes that are separate from the changes in structure that come simply from increasing the number of nodes in the webs. Furthermore, we show that the magnitude of these changes is related to ontogenetic specialism, the degree of overlap in the ecological niches of life stages. These results demonstrate the capacity of intraspecific variation to affect ecological networks and indicate the potential usefulness of stage-structured food webs, which capture size and taxonomic information, to represent variation below the species level.

AB On St. Paul Island, a remnant of the Bering Land Bridge, woolly mammoths persisted until 5,600 yr BP with no known predators or competitors, providing a natural system for studying hypothesized environmental drivers of extinction. These include overheating due to rising temperatures, starvation, and drought. Here, we test these hypotheses using Niche Mapper and LPJ-GUESS to mechanistically estimate mammoth metabolic rates and dietary and freshwater requirements and, from these, estimate variations in island carrying capacity on St. Paul for the last 17,000 yr. Population carrying capacity may have been several hundred individuals at the time of initial isolation from the mainland. Adult mammoths could have fasted for two to three months, indicating a necessary ability to access snow-buried forage. During the Holocene, vegetation net primary productivity increased, but shrinking island area overrode increased net primary productivity (NPP), lowering carrying capacity to similar to 100 individuals. NPP and freshwater availability alternated as critical limiting factors for this island population during the environmental changes of the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Only two or three individuals could have been sustained by the freshwater surplus in crater lakes (up to 18 individuals under the most optimistic parameter sensitivity experiments), suggesting that the St. Paul mammoth population was highly dependent on coastal freshwater sources. The simulations are consistent with the available proxy data, while highlighting the need to retrieve new paleohydrological proxy records from the coastal lagoons to test model predictions. More broadly, these findings reinforce the vulnerability of island megaherbivore populations to resource limitation and extinction.

AB Plants are able to adjust their anti-herbivore defenses in response to the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by herbivore-damaged neighbors, and some of these changes increase resistance against subsequent herbivory. This phenomenon of plant-plant communication is thought to be widespread, but recent investigations have cautioned that it can be context dependent, including variation in the strength of communication based on the identity of plants and their associated herbivores. Here, we performed three greenhouse experiments using multiple male and female genotypes of the dioecious woody shrub Baccharis salicifolia and its specialist aphid Uroleucon macolai to test for specificity of plant-plant communication with respect to plant sex and genotype. Moreover, we evaluated plant sexual dimorphism and genotypic variation in VOC emissions (i.e., the "speaking" side of the interaction) and response of plants to VOC exposure (i.e., the "listening" side of the interaction) in order to identify the chemical mechanisms underlying such specificity. We did not find genotypic specificity of communication; emitter plants damaged by U. macolai significantly reduced subsequent U. macolai performance on receivers, but these effects were indistinguishable for communication within vs. among genotypes. In contrast, we found sex specificity of communication; male emitter plants reduced subsequent U. macolai performance on male and female receiver plants equally, while female emitter plants only did so for female receivers. We found sexual (but not genotypic) dimorphism in speaking but not listening; of the seven compounds induced by U. macolai feeding (speaking), pinocarvone was approximately fivefold greater in female than in male plants, while exposure of plants to pinocarvone emissions (listening) reduced U. macolai performance equally in both male and female plants. Together, our study demonstrates novel evidence for sexually dimorphic specificity of plant-plant communication and the chemical mechanism underlying this effect.

AB Predicting biotic responses to environmental change requires understanding the joint effects of abiotic conditions and biotic interactions on community dynamics. One major challenge is to separate the potentially confounding effects of abiotic environmental variation and local biotic interactions on individual performance. The stress gradient hypothesis (SGH) addresses this issue directly by predicting that the effects of biotic interactions on performance become more positive as the abiotic environment becomes more stressful. It is unclear, however, how the predictions of the SGH apply to plants of differing functional strategies in diverse communities. We asked (1) how the effect of crowding on performance (growth and survival) of trees varies across a precipitation gradient, and (2) how functional strategies (as measured by two key traits: wood density and leaf mass per area, LMA) mediate average demographic rates and responses to crowding across the gradient. We built trait-based neighborhood models of growth and survival across a regional precipitation gradient where increasing precipitation is associated with reduced abiotic stress. In total, our dataset comprised similar to 170,000 individual trees belonging to 252 species. The effect of crowding on tree performance varied across the gradient; crowding negatively affected growth across plots and positively affected survival in the wettest plot. Functional traits mediated average demographic rates across the gradient, but we did not find clear evidence that the strength of these responses depends on species' traits. Our study lends support to the SGH and demonstrates how a trait-based perspective can advance these concepts by linking the diversity of species interactions with functional variation across abiotic gradients.

AB Invasive ecosystem engineers both positively and negatively affect their recipient ecosystems by generating novel habitats. Many studies have focused on alterations to ecosystem properties and to native species diversity and abundance caused by invasive engineers. However, relatively few studies have documented the extent to which behaviors of native species are affected. The red seaweed Gracilaria vermiculophylla (Rhodophyta) invaded estuaries of the southeastern United States within the last few decades and now provides abundant aboveground vegetative cover on intertidal mudflats that were historically devoid of seaweeds. We hypothesized that G. vermiculophylla would affect the foraging behavior of native shorebirds positively for birds that target seaweed-associated invertebrates or negatively for birds that target prey on or within the sediment now covered with seaweed. Visual surveys of mudflats >1 ha in size revealed that more shorebirds occurred on mudflats with G. vermiculophylla relative to mudflats without G. vermiculophylla. This increased density was consistent across 7 of 8 species, with the one exception being the semipalmated plover Charadrius semipalmatus. A regression-based analysis indicated that while algal presence predicted shorebird density, densities of some bird species depended on sediment composition and infaunal invertebrate densities. At smaller spatial scales (200 m(2) and <1 m(2)), experimental removals and additions of G. vermiculophylla and focal observations showed strong variation in behavioral response to G. vermiculophylla among bird species. Birds preferentially foraged in bare mud (e.g., C. semipalmatus), in G. vermiculophylla (e.g., Arenaria interpres), or displayed no preference for either habitat (e.g., Tringa semipalmata). Thus, while the presence of the invasive ecosystem engineer on a mudflat appeared to attract greater numbers of these predators, shorebird species differed in their behavioral responses at the smaller spatial scales that affect their foraging. Our research illuminates the need to account for species identity, individual behavior, and scale when predicting the impacts of invasive species on native communities.

AB Communities comprising alien species with different residence times are natural experiments allowing the assessment of drivers of community assembly over time. Stochastic processes (such as dispersal and fluctuating environments) should be the dominant factors structuring communities of exotic species with short residence times. In contrast, communities should become more similar, or systematically diverge, if they contain exotics with increasing resident times, due to the increasing importance of deterministic processes (such as environmental filtering). We use zeta diversity (the number of species shared by multiple assemblages) to explore the relationship between the turnover of native species and two categories of alien species with different residence times (archaeophytes [introduced between 4000 BC and 1500 AD] and neophytes [introduced after 1500 AD]) in a network of nature reserves in central Europe. By considering multiple assemblages simultaneously, zeta diversity allows us to determine the contribution of rare and widespread species to turnover. Specifically, we explore the relative effects of assembly processes representing isolation by distance, environmental filtering, and environmental stochasticity (fluctuating environments) on zeta diversity using Multi-Site Generalized Dissimilarity Modelling (MS-GDM). Four clusters of results emerged. First, stochastic processes for structuring plant assemblages decreased in importance with increasing residence time. Environmental stochasticity only affected species composition for neophytes, offering possibilities to predict the spread debt of recent invasions. Second, native species turnover was well explained by environmental filtering and isolation by distance, although these factors did not explain the turnover of archaeophytes and neophytes. Third, native and alien species compositions were only correlated for rare species, whereas turnover in widespread alien species was surprisingly unrelated to the composition of widespread native species. Site-specific approaches would therefore be more appropriate for the monitoring and management of rare alien species, whereas species-specific approaches would suit widespread species. Finally, the size difference of nature reserves influences not only native species richness, but also their richness-independent turnover. A network of reserves must therefore be designed and managed using a variety of approaches to enhance native diversity, while controlling alien species with different residence times and degrees of commonness.

AB Closely related, ecologically similar species are often separated at small geographic scales while being broadly sympatric. Both adaptation to abiotic environmental conditions and a variety of biotic interactions may determine small-scale allopatry. In Northern California's coast range, two monkeyflower species, Mimulus guttatus and Mimulus nudatus, can co-occur within local sites but rarely overlap at fine spatial scales, even though they are often separated by less than 1 m. M. guttatus naturally grows in wetter areas and is often submerged for up to four months of the year, while M. nudatus naturally occupies drier sites. We used a combination of observational data, reciprocal transplant, and laboratory experiments to test a series of biotic and abiotic hypotheses for the observed distribution pattern. Although M. guttatus can tolerate dry hillside conditions like those in which M. nudatus occurs, M. nudatus is unable to survive submerged for more than a week, limiting its distribution from seasonal streams inundated for months and dominated by M. guttatus. While herbivores did not differentially damage species, transplants were more likely to be damaged in M. guttatus' seep habitat and M. nudatus was less tolerant to herbivory. Individuals of each species transplanted into populations of heterospecific congeners produced large proportions (up to 80%) of inviable seeds resulting from increased hybridization rates in close sympatry. Mimulus nudatus' inability to tolerate submergence and herbivory establishes some degree of habitat association, and then, hybrid seed inviability reduces the ability of the locally rarer species to persist within the congener's microhabitat and maintains habitat segregation. Together these data show that both environmental filtering and biotic interactions shape the fine-scale distribution of close relatives.

AB The spatial distribution of species is not random; instead, individuals tend to gather, resulting in a non-random pattern. Previous studies used the independent negative binomial distribution (NBD) to model the distributional aggregation of a single species, in which the independence of the distribution of individuals of a species in different quadrats had been assumed. This way of analyzing aggregation will result in the scale-dependent estimation of the aggregation or shape parameter. However, because non-random (and therefore non-independent) distribution of individuals of a species in a finite area can be caused by either correlated or clumped distribution of individuals of a species between neighboring sites, an alternative model would assume that the distribution of individuals of a species over different sampling areas is multinomial. Here, we showed that, by assuming that regional species abundance followed a NBD while using a multinomial distribution to assign individuals of species in different non-overlapped sampling quadrats that are from a partition of the entire region (quantifying positive correlation or synchrony), the estimation of the shape parameter in this probabilistic model, which is the negative multinomial distribution (NMD), was scale-invariant (i.e., the estimated shape parameter is identical across different partitions of the study region). Accordingly, the estimation of the shape parameter was related to regional species distribution alone. This implied that, the shape parameter at the community level, using the NMD model, reflected the evenness of interspecific abundance. As a comparison, if the distribution of individuals of a single species followed independent NBDs as studied previously, the shape parameter would measure the evenness of intraspecific abundance (quantifying single-species' distributional aggregation). Moreover, our study highlighted the necessity for adjusting the model for the effects of unsampled species when studying community-level distributional patterns. Collectively, as long as a target area is partitioned into non-overlapping quadrats (no matter how their sizes vary), the proposed NMD model in this study, along with the independent NBDs model, can be jointly formulated as a framework to reconcile the scale-dependent debate on the shape parameter, unifying the relationship between inter- or intraspecific abundance and distributional patterns.

AB The concept of microsites for recruitment is central to plant ecology, but it is unclear whether these sites are abstract constructs or real entities. I hypothesize that, in generally microsite-limited communities, microsites comprise a limiting physical resource for which different species compete. I tested this hypothesis on winter-annual communities on biocrust in the semiarid Northern Negev of Israel, in which most species are microsite-limited, while the dominant grass (Stipa capensis) has overcome this limitation by efficient microsite acquisition and a lack of secondary seed dormancy. I tested whether the dominant suppresses the subordinate species, collectively, during recruitment, rather than during growth. To this end, I conducted a field experiment with three blocks of six plots (6 m x 6 m) with two treatments - mowing in spring 2006 (intershrub, intershrub + shrub patches, and none) and shrub-patch removal (0% or 50% of the patches). I collected data from four seed traps per plot before spring 2007 and from five plant samples per plot at the end of spring. Mowing significantly reduced both seed and plant density of the dominant species, reflecting seed-limited recruitment, and increased subordinate plant density by competitive release. Multiple regressions of per-plant and per-gram effects and responses showed that competition was a direct effect of the dominant's density. Total and per-group biomass was proportional to density, implying density-independent per capita growth. Subordinate species number also increased with their density, due to the sample-size effect. These findings indicate that the seed-limited dominant diffusely suppresses the subordinates during recruitment, supporting the microsite competition hypothesis. The shift from growth resources to microsites extends the role of inter-specific competition along productivity and disturbance gradients, and highlights the asymmetric relationship between the two kinds of competition, as microsite competition is only observable if initial abundances are not overshadowed by density-dependent growth and mortality. The findings also demonstrate that (1) lacking secondary seed dormancy is an evolutionarily stable strategy in dryland annuals, alongside seed dormancy in microsite-limited species, and (2) biomass removal (e.g., by herbivory) increases small-scale biodiversity, enhancing the sustainability of dryland grazing, but without compensatory growth.

AB Many wildlife populations are either naturally, or as a result of human land use, patchily distributed in space. The degree of fragmentation-specifically the remaining patch sizes and habitat configuration-is an important part of population dynamics. Demographic stochasticity is also likely to play an important role in patchy habitats that host small local populations. We develop a simulation model to evaluate the significance of demographic stochasticity and the role fragmentation plays in the determination of population dynamics and the risk of extinction of populations on habitat patches. Our model is formulated as a Markov-chain stochastic process on a finite, spatially explicit array of patches in which probability of successful dispersal is a function of interpatch distance. Unlike past work, we explicitly model local population dynamics and examine how these scale up to the entire population. As a test case, we apply the model to the American pika (Ochotona princeps) population living on the ore dumps in the ghost mining town of Bodie, California. This population has been studied nearly continuously for over four decades and has been of conservation concern as the southern half of the population declined precipitously beginning in 1989. Our model suggests that both the specific configuration of habitat and landscape heterogeneity are necessary and sufficient predictors of the eventual extinction of the southern constellation of patches. This example has important implications, as it suggests that fragmentation alone can lead to regional extinctions within metapopulations.

AB Disentangling the influence of demographic parameters and the role of density dependence on species' population dynamics is a challenge, especially when fractions of the population are unobservable. Additionally, due to the difficulty of gathering data at large spatial scales, most studies ignore the global dynamic of a species, which would integrate local heterogeneity dynamics and remove the noise of dispersal. We developed an integrated population model (IPM) at a global scale to disentangle the main demographic drivers of population dynamics in a long-lived species. We used 28 yr of Audouin's Gull demographic data encompassing 69 local patches (comprising 90% of the world population). Importantly, we took into account the unobservable fraction of non-breeders and also assessed the strength of density dependence for this fraction of the population. As predicted by life histories of long-lived organisms, temporal random variation in survival was highest for immature individuals (1.326, 95% credible interval [CRI] 1.290-1.940) and lowest for adults (0.499, 95% CRI 0.487-0.720). Large temporal fluctuations in the probability of taking a reproductive sabbatical would partly explain the consistency in adult survival, with individuals most likely refraining from breeding when environmental conditions were harsh. Immature survival and fertility were the main drivers of population dynamics during the study period (r(2) = 0.83, 0.77-0.87 and 0.73, 0.63-0.79, respectively). We found strong evidence of density dependence, not only due to the number of breeders (r(2) = -0.34, -0.43 to -0.24) but also due to individuals on sabbatical (r(2) = -0.18, -0.33 to -0.01). From a conservation point of view, the species shows a 5% annual global decrease during the last 10 years, and we propose an update of its conservation status. Even though population dynamics of long-lived organisms are very sensitive to changes in adult survival, we show here that, in the absence of strong environmental perturbations affecting this vital rate, fluctuations in population density are mainly driven by variations in survival of immature individuals and fertility. Integrated models based on long-term monitoring at a global scale may enhance our ecological and evolutionary understanding of how demographic drivers influence population dynamics.

AB Box Plants and animals host many microbial symbionts, including both pathogens and mutualists. However, most experimental studies include only one symbiont, and few examine interactions of more than two microbes with their host. Here, we examined whether coinfection with two pathogens causes a synergistic reduction in the benefits that hosts receive from a microbial mutualist. We also measured the effects of a microbial mutualist on the within- and between-host competition between coinfecting pathogens. We manipulated the presence of Clover yellow vein virus (ClYVV), Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), rhizobia bacteria, and nitrogen fertilizer in common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris). We found asymmetric, context-dependent interactions among the three microbial symbionts and their host. Coinfection with both viruses led to greater than additive negative effects on the amount of nitrogen that plants received from rhizobia. Rhizobia colonization decreased immune signaling in singly infected plants, but not in coinfected plants. Compared to single ClYVV infection, ClYVV reached higher concentrations within hosts coinfected with BCMV, but only in the presence of rhizobia. Coinfection increased BCMV vertical transmission rates for plants without supplemental nitrogen, but overall vertical transmission opportunities were not affected due to reduced seed production. Examining interactions between multiple microbes sharing a host can reveal important insights about nutrient cycling, disease severity, and pathogen epidemiology.

AB Soil nutrients influence the distribution of tree species in lowland tropical forests, but their effect on productivity, especially at local scales, remains unclear. We used tree census, canopy occupancy, and soil data from the Barro Colorado Island (BCI; Panama) 50-ha forest dynamics plot to investigate the influence of soil nutrients and potential toxins on aboveground tree productivity. Growth was calculated as the increase in diameter of 150,000 individual stems >= 1 cm diameter at breast height, representing 207 species. The effects of soil variables and other strong predictors of growth (e.g., light) were estimated using hierarchical, linear, mixed-effects models. Growth was weakly positively associated with phosphorus (P), particularly for understory tree species that are typically considered to be limited by light. In contrast, growth was strongly negatively related to manganese (Mn) and aluminum (Al), although the latter effect was confounded by strong correlations between Al and other soil variables. The negative response to increasing Mn (and Al) suggests a toxicity effect due to solubilization and uptake of amorphous pools of metal oxides in the soil. These results show that P limits tropical tree growth at local scale on BCI, but that toxic metals represent an even greater constraint on productivity.

AB Understanding how variation in hosts, parasites, and the environment shapes patterns of disease is key to predicting ecological and evolutionary outcomes of epidemics. Yet in spatially structured populations, variation in host resistance may be spatially confounded with variation in parasite dispersal and environmental factors that affect disease processes. To tease apart these disease drivers, we paired surveys of natural epidemics with experiments manipulating spatial variation in host susceptibility to infection. We mapped epidemics of the wind-dispersed powdery mildew pathogen Podosphaera plantaginis in five populations of its plant host, Plantago lanceolata. At 15 replicate sites within each population, we deployed groups of healthy potted 'sentinel' plants from five allopatric host lines. By tracking which sentinels became infected in the field and measuring pathogen connectivity and microclimate at those sites, we could test how variation in these factors affected disease when spatial variation in host resistance and soil conditions was minimized. We found that the prevalence and severity of sentinel infection varied over small spatial scales in the field populations, largely due to heterogeneity in pathogen prevalence on wild plants and unmeasured environmental factors. Microclimate was critical for disease spread only at the onset of epidemics, where humidity increased infection risk. Sentinels were more likely to become infected than initially healthy wild plants at a given field site. However, in a follow-up laboratory inoculation study we detected no significant differences between wild and sentinel plant lines in their qualitative susceptibility to pathogen isolates from the field populations, suggesting that primarily non-genetic differences between sentinel and wild hosts drove their differential infection rates in the field. Our study leverages a multi-faceted experimental approach to disentangle important biotic and abiotic drivers of disease patterns within wild populations.

AB The use of database technologies as a tool for implementing data for quantitative ecological studies and biodiversity conservation planning has recently attracted the attention of the biological community. Despite the fact that the number of biodiversity data sets is quickly rising, online databases of small mammals are still scarce, especially for Mediterranean ecosystems. We implemented the first standardized and accessible georeferenced European database of small mammal occurrences, abundances, and functional traits. Data derived from owl pellets was obtained from different sources, including original field surveys, publications, gray literature, existing databases, and museum collections. The OpenMICE database covers the years 1972 to 2017 and includes nearly 50,000 individuals from 23 species (13 Rodentia and 10 Eulipotyphla) at 190 sites in south-central Italy. Our specific goals in compiling this data set were as follows: (1) to make data that is usually accessible to a restricted audience widely available; (2) to identify the gaps in knowledge about small mammal communities and guide future sampling and conservation efforts; and (3) to gain a first insight into small mammal diversity and abundance in the study area. The potential applications of our spatial relational database are many, from individual-based to community-based models as potential indicators of environmental changes at different geographical scales. Given the long-term support for data storage, the OpenMICE database could be further expanded to include other geographical contexts and implemented with new information and traits. We would appreciate that researchers cite this paper if using all or part of the data set. We also request that researchers and teachers inform us of how they are using the data. We intend to keep it up to date as novel studies become available (see Data Availability).

AB Butterflies are one of the best-known insect groups, and they have been the subject of numerous studies in ecology and evolution, especially in the tropics. Much attention has been given to the fruit-feeding butterfly guild in biodiversity conservation studies, due to the relative ease with which taxa may be identified and specimens sampled using bait traps. However, there remain many uncertainties about the macroecological and biogeographical patterns of butterflies in tropical ecosystems. In the present study, we gathered information about fruit-feeding butterfly species in local communities from the Atlantic Forests of South America. The ATLANTIC BUTTERFLIES data set, which is part of ATLANTIC SERIES data papers, results from a compilation of 145 unpublished inventories and 64 other references, including articles, theses, and book chapters published from 1949 to 2018. In total, the data set contains 7,062 records (presence) of 279 species of fruit-feeding butterflies identified with taxonomic certainty, from 122 study locations. The Satyrini is the tribe with highest number of species (45%) and records (30%), followed by Brassolini, with 13% of species and 12.5% of records. The 10 most common species correspond to 14.2% of all records. This data set represents a major effort to compile inventories of fruit-feeding butterfly communities, filling a knowledge gap about the diversity and distribution of these butterflies in the Atlantic Forest. We hope that the present data set can provide guidelines for future studies and planning of new inventories of fruit-feeding butterflies in this biome. The information presented here also has potential use in studies across a great variety of spatial scales, from local and landscape levels to macroecological research and biogeographical research. We expect that such studies be very important for the better implementation of conservation initiatives, and for understanding the multiple ecological processes that involve fruit-feeding butterflies as biological indicators. No copyright restrictions apply to the use of this data set. Please cite this Data paper when using the current data in publications or teaching events.

AB A data set of common forest metrics was prepared using inventory data from Ecological Reserves in Maine, northeastern USA. An Ecological Reserve is generally defined as an area where timber harvesting does not occur and natural disturbance events are allowed to proceed without significant human influence. Beginning in the early 2000s, permanent, long term monitoring plots were established in Reserves across Maine. To date, 50 Reserves occupying approximately 70,820 ha with a total of 1,103 monitoring plots comprise Maine's Ecological Reserve System. A goal of the Ecological Reserve Monitoring program is to remeasure plots every 10 years and about half of the plots have been remeasured since the initial inventory. Stand metrics were calculated for both monitoring rounds and include: live tree basal area, live tree density, large (diameter at breast height, dbh >= 40 cm) and very large (dbh >= 51 cm) live tree density, standing dead tree density, large (dbh >= 40 cm) and very large (dbh >= 51 cm) standing dead tree density, total and large (diameter at transect intersect >= 40 cm) downed coarse woody debris volume, as well as various stand dynamic metrics. For comparison, the same metrics were computed for managed forests in Maine using permanent plot data from the US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program. Information on Ecological Reserve monitoring plots includes Ecological Reserve name, forest-type group, geographic location, elevation, slope, aspect, and harvest history. This data should prove invaluable for assessing and evaluating long-term changes in Ecological Reserves across the broad ecological/climate zones that are present in Maine.

AB Species-level dispersal information can give mechanistic insights into how spatial processes impact plant communities. Unfortunately, field-based estimates of the dispersal abilities of multiple members of a community are often lacking for many plant systems. Here, we provide a simple method for measuring dispersal ability for large numbers of grassland plant species based on functional traits. Using this method, we estimated the dispersal ability of 50 co-occurring grassland species using the Wald Analytical Long-distance Dispersal (WALD) model. Grassland plants species are often used for developing community theory, yet species-level estimates of their dispersal abilities are comparatively rare. We use these dispersal measurements to examine the relationship between species dispersal abilities and successional dynamics using data from a 90-yr old field chronosequence. We find that our estimated dispersal measurements matched field-based establishment observations well, and estimated species colonization, competitive, and establishment abilities. We hope that this method for measuring dispersal ability of multiple species within a community, and its demonstrated ability to generate predictions for spatial ecology, will encourage more studies of the explicit role of dispersal in plant community ecology.

AB The cross-scale resilience model suggests that system-level ecological resilience emerges from the distribution of species' functions within and across the spatial and temporal scales of a system. It has provided a quantitative method for calculating the resilience of a given system and so has been a valuable contribution to a largely qualitative field. As it is currently laid out, the model accounts for the spatial and temporal scales at which environmental resources and species are present and the functional roles species play but does not inform us about how much resource is present or how much function is provided. In short, it does not account for abundance in the distribution of species and their functional roles within and across the scales of a system. We detail the ways in which we would expect species' abundance to be relevant to the cross-scale resilience model based on the extensive abundance literature in ecology. We also put forward a series of testable hypotheses that would improve our ability to anticipate and quantify how resilience is generated, and how ecosystems will (or will not) buffer recent rapid global changes. This stream of research may provide an improved foundation for the quantitative evaluation of ecological resilience.

AB As they return to spawn and die in their natal streams, anadromous, semelparous fishes such as Pacific salmon import marine-derived nutrients to otherwise nutrient-poor freshwater and riparian ecosystems. Diverse organisms exploit this resource, and previous studies have indicated that riparian tree growth may be enhanced by such marine-derived nutrients. However, these studies were largely inferential and did not account for all factors affecting tree growth. As an experimental test of the contribution of carcasses to tree growth, for 20 yr, we systematically deposited all sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) carcasses (217,055 individual salmon) in the riparian zone on one bank of a 2-km-long stream in southwestern Alaska, reducing carcass accumulation on one bank and enhancing it on the other. After accounting for partial consumption and movement of carcasses by brown bears (Ursus arctos) and variation in salmon abundance and body size, we estimated that 267,620 kg of salmon were deposited on the enhanced bank and 45,200 kg on the depleted bank over the 20 yr, for a 5.9-fold difference in total mass. In 2016, we sampled needles of 84 white spruce trees (Picea glauca) the dominant riparian tree species, for foliar nitrogen (N) content and stable isotope ratios (delta N-15), and took core samples for annual growth increments. Stable isotope analysis indicated that marine-derived N was incorporated into the new growth of the trees on the enhanced bank. Analysis of tree cores indicated that in the two decades prior to our enhancement experiment, trees on the south-facing (subsequently the depleted) bank grew faster than those on the north-facing (later enhanced) bank. This difference was reduced significantly during the two decades of fertilization, indicating an effect of the carcass transfer experiment against the background of other factors affecting tree growth.

AB Disturbances often cause the disproportionate loss of foundation species but understanding how the frequency and severity of disturbance to such organisms influence biological communities remains unresolved. This gap in knowledge exists in part because of the rarity of ecologically meaningful studies capable of disentangling different elements of disturbance. Hence, we carried out a long-term (9 yr), large-scale (2,000 m(2) plots), spatially replicated (4 sites) field experiment in which we manipulated disturbance to a globally distributed marine foundation species, the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, and tracked community responses over time. To distinguish the effects of disturbance frequency and severity on the biodiversity and composition of temperate rocky reef communities, we simulated the repeated loss of giant kelp from destructive winter waves across a background of natural variation in disturbance. By following the response of over 200 taxa from the surrounding community, we discovered that the frequency of disturbance to giant kelp changed the biomass, diversity, and composition of community guilds in a manner commensurate with their dependence on the physical (i.e., benthic light and space), trophic (i.e., living and detrital biomass), and habitat (i.e., biogenic structure) resources mediated by this foundation species. Annual winter disturbance to giant kelp reduced living and detrital giant kelp biomass by 57% and 40%, respectively, enhanced bottom light by 22%, and halved the seafloor area covered by giant kelp holdfasts. Concomitantly, the biomass of understory algae and epilithic sessile invertebrates more than doubled, while the biomass of rock-boring clams, mobile invertebrates, and fishes decreased 30-61%. Frequent loss of giant kelp boosted understory algal richness by 82% and lowered sessile invertebrate richness by 13% but did not affect the biodiversity of mobile fauna. In contrast to changes driven by disturbance frequency, interannual variation in the severity of disturbance to giant kelp had weaker, less consistent effects, causing only modest changes in assemblages of sessile invertebrates, mobile invertebrate herbivores, and fishes. Our results broaden the foundation species concept by demonstrating that repeated disturbance to a dominant habitat-forming species can outweigh the influence of less frequent but severe disturbances for the surrounding community.

AB More than 200 years ago, Alexander von Humboldt reported that tropical plant species richness decreased with increasing elevation and decreasing temperature. Surprisingly, coordinated patterns in plant, bacterial, and fungal diversity on tropical mountains have not yet been observed, despite the central role of soil microorganisms in terrestrial biogeochemistry and ecology. We studied an Andean transect traversing 3.5 km in elevation to test whether the species diversity and composition of tropical forest plants, soil bacteria, and fungi follow similar biogeographical patterns with shared environmental drivers. We found coordinated changes with elevation in all three groups: species richness declined as elevation increased, and the compositional dissimilarity among communities increased with increased separation in elevation, although changes in plant diversity were larger than in bacteria and fungi. Temperature was the dominant driver of these diversity gradients, with weak influences of edaphic properties, including soil pH. The gradients in microbial diversity were strongly correlated with the activities of enzymes involved in organic matter cycling, and were accompanied by a transition in microbial traits towards slower-growing, oligotrophic taxa at higher elevations. We provide the first evidence of coordinated temperature-driven patterns in the diversity and distribution of three major biotic groups in tropical ecosystems: soil bacteria, fungi, and plants. These findings suggest that interrelated and fundamental patterns of plant and microbial communities with shared environmental drivers occur across landscape scales. These patterns are revealed where soil pH is relatively constant, and have implications for tropical forest communities under future climate change.

AB Consensus has emerged in the literature that increased biodiversity enhances the capacity of ecosystems to perform multiple functions. However, most biodiversity/ecosystem function studies focus on a single ecosystem, or on landscapes of homogenous ecosystems. Here, we investigate how increased landscape-level environmental dissimilarity may affect the relationship between different metrics of diversity (alpha, beta, or gamma) and ecosystem function. We produced a suite of simulated landscapes, each of which contained four experimental outdoor aquatic mesocosms. Differences in temperature and nutrient conditions of the mesocosms allowed us to simulate landscapes containing a range of within-landscape environmental heterogeneities. We found that the variation in ecosystem functions was primarily controlled by environmental conditions, with diversity metrics accounting for a smaller (but significant) amount of variation in function. When landscapes were more homogeneous, alpha, beta, and gamma diversity was not associated with differences in primary production, and only gamma was associated with changes in decomposition. In these homogeneous landscapes, differences in these two ecosystem functions were most strongly related to nutrient and temperature conditions in the ecosystems. However, as landscape-level environmental dissimilarity increased, the relationship between alpha, beta, or gamma and ecosystem functions strengthened, with beta being a greater predictor of variation in decomposition at the highest levels of environmental dissimilarity than alpha or gamma. We propose that when all ecosystems in a landscape have similar environmental conditions, species sorting is likely to generate a single community composition that is well suited to those environmental conditions, beta is low, and the efficiency of diversity-ecosystem function couplings is similar across communities. Under this low beta, the effect of abiotic conditions on ecosystem function will be most apparent. However, when environmental conditions vary among ecosystems, species sorting pressures are different among ecosystems, producing different communities among locations in a landscape. These conditions lead to stronger relationships between beta and the magnitude of ecosystem functions. Our results illustrate that abiotic conditions and the homogeneity of communities influence ecosystem function expressed at the landscape scale.

AB Free-living heterotrophic nitrogen fixation (FNF) is a widespread nitrogen input pathway in terrestrial ecosystems. However, questions remain over the relative influence of co-occurring controls on patterns of heterotrophic FNF activity, especially across generalized stages of primary succession, from biomass accumulation to retrogressive phases. Here, we experimentally test two alternative hypotheses regarding FNF rates during ecosystem development: (H1) site (i.e., changes in soil fertility during succession) is the primary driver of leaf-litter FNF rates, vs. (H2) leaf-litter chemistry is the primary determinant of FNF activity across a broad range of ecosystem conditions. We evaluated these hypotheses across a well-studied soil chronosequence in California (i.e., the Ecological Staircase), which spans similar to 1 million years of ecosystem development and displays extreme ranges in plant-soil nutrient conditions, culminating in the nutrient depleted and stunted Pygmy forest. Across this successional gradient, we implemented a reciprocal leaf-litter transplant and a common garden litter bag decomposition experiment with senesced needles of Pinus muricata. Our results support H1: rates of FNF were similar for all leaf-litter types decomposed at the same site regardless of initial leaf-litter C and nutrient contents. FNF rates sharply declined from the maximal to retrogressive stage of succession. Trends in P dynamics during decomposition suggest an important role of P in regulating FNF. For example, P. muricata litter collected from the infertile Pygmy site displayed substantially higher FNF rates when decomposed at the fertile site, in part by immobilizing significant quantities of P from the soil at the fertile site. Conversely, P. muricata litter collected from the fertile site decomposed more slowly at the Pygmy site, with concomitant declines in FNF rates that matched those of Pygmy site litter decomposed in situ. These results are consistent with the idea that, over millennia, long-term declines in P availability feedback to constrain FNF rates, in part explaining the emergence of extremely nutrient-poor and retrograded ecosystems.

AB Intensifying drought is increasingly linked to global forest diebacks. Improved understanding of drought impacts on individual trees has provided limited insight into drought vulnerability in part because tree moisture access and depletion is difficult to quantify. In forests, moisture reservoir depletion occurs through water use by the trees themselves. Here, we show that drought impacts on tree fitness and demographic performance can be predicted by tracking the moisture reservoir available to trees as a mass balance, estimated in a hierarchical state-space framework. We apply this model to multiple seasonal droughts with tree transpiration measurements to demonstrate how species and size differences modulate moisture availability across landscapes. The depletion of individual moisture reservoirs can be tracked over the course of droughts and linked to biomass growth and reproductive output. This mass balance approach can predict individual moisture deficit, tree demographic performance, and drought vulnerability throughout forest stands based on measurements from a sample of trees.

AB Self-facilitation allows populations to persist under disturbance by ameliorating experienced stress. In coastal ecosystems, eutrophication and declines of large predatory fish are two common disturbances that can synergistically impact habitat-forming plants by benefitting ephemeral algae. In theory, density-dependent intraspecific plant facilitation could weaken such effects by ameliorating the amount of experienced stress. Here, we tested whether and how shoot density of a common aquatic plant (Myriophyllum spicatum) alters the response of individual plants to eutrophication and exclusion of large predatory fish, using a 12-week cage experiment in the field. Results showed that high plant density benefitted individual plant performance, but only when the two stressors were combined. Epiphytic algal biomass per plant more than doubled in cages that excluded large predatory fish, indicative of a trophic cascade. Moreover, in this treatment, individual shoot biomass, as well as number of branches, increased with density when nutrients were added, but decreased with density at ambient nutrient levels. In contrast, in open cages that large predatory fish could access, epiphytic algal biomass was low and individual plant biomass and number of branches were unaffected by plant density and eutrophication. Plant performance generally decreased under fertilization, suggesting stressful conditions. Together, these results suggest that intraspecific plant facilitation occurred only when large fish exclusion (causing high epiphyte load) was accompanied by fertilization, and that intraspecific competition instead prevailed when no nutrients were added. As coastal ecosystems are increasingly exposed to multiple and often interacting stressors such as eutrophication and declines of large predatory fish, maintaining high plant density is important for ecosystem-based management.

AB Biomass production efficiency (BPE), the ratio of biomass production to photosynthesis, varies greatly among ecosystems and typically increases with increasing nutrient availability. Reduced carbon partitioning to mycorrhizal fungi (i.e., per unit photosynthesis) is the hypothesized underlying mechanism, as mycorrhizal abundance and plant dependence on these symbionts typically decrease with increasing nutrient availability. In a mesocosm experiment with Zea mays, we investigated the effect of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) addition and of mycorrhizal inoculation on BPE. Photosynthesis and respiration were measured at mesocosm scale and at leaf scale. The growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) was assessed with ingrowth bags while also making use of the difference in delta C-13 between C-4 plants and C-3 soil. Mesocosms without AMF, that is, with pasteurized soil, were used to further explore the role of AMF. Plant growth, photosynthesis, and BPE were positively affected by P, but not by N addition. AMF biomass also was slightly higher under P addition, but carbon partitioning to AMF was significantly lower than without P addition. Interestingly, in the absence of AMF, plants that did not receive P died prematurely. Our study confirmed the hypothesis that BPE increases with increasing nutrient availability, and that carbon partitioning to AMF plays a key role in this nutrient effect. The comparison of inoculated vs. pasteurized mesocosms further suggested a lower carbon cost of nutrient uptake via AMF than via other mechanisms under nutrient rich conditions.

AB Hotspots of disease transmission can strongly influence pathogen spread. Bee pathogens may be transmitted via shared floral use, but the role of plant species and floral trait variation in shaping transmission dynamics is almost entirely unexplored. Given the importance of pathogens for the decline of several bee species, understanding whether and how plant species and floral traits affect transmission could give us important tools for predicting which plant species may be hotspots for disease spread. We assessed variation in transmission via susceptibility (probability of infection) and mean intensity (cell count of infected bees) of the trypanosomatid gut pathogen Crithidia bombi to uninfected Bombus impatiens workers foraging on 14 plant species, and assessed the role of floral traits, bee size and foraging behavior on transmission. We also conducted a manipulative experiment to determine how the number of open flowers affected transmission on three plant species, Penstemon digitalis, Monarda didyma, and Lythrum salicaria. Plant species differed fourfold in the overall mean abundance of Crithidia in foraging bumble bees (mean including infected and uninfected bees). Across plant species, bee susceptibility and mean intensity increased with the number of reproductive structures per inflorescence (buds, flowers and fruits); smaller bees and those that foraged longer were also more susceptible. Trait-based models were as good or better than species-based models at predicting susceptibility and mean intensity based on AIC values. Surprisingly, floral size and morphology did not significantly predict transmission across species. In the manipulative experiment, more open flowers increased mean pathogen abundance fourfold in Monarda, but had no effect in the other two plant species. Our results suggest that variation among plant species, through their influence on pathogen transmission, may shape bee disease dynamics. Given widespread investment in pollinator-friendly plantings to support pollinators, understanding how plant species affect disease transmission is important for recommending plant species that optimize pollinator health.

AB Climate-driven global change is shifting the distribution and abundance of foundation species that form the base of ecosystems. The corresponding responses of inhabitant species to shifts in habitat-forming species are poorly understood, however we expect community responses to depend on how species perceive habitat patches and sort among them, particularly along range edges. We used the poleward shift of a mangrove-marsh ecotone to evaluate sorting of marine macrofauna (small fish and decapod crustaceans) among vegetation patches at a series of nested scales. Within the mangrove-marsh ecotone, we deployed retrievable panels of artificial vegetation structures mimicking a marsh grass and two mangrove species in patches dominated by each of these three foundation species. Over six months, we observed macrofaunal sorting by physical structure, isolated on panels, and by patch type, which included stand-level attributes such as production, shading, and chemical cues. We found multiscale partitioning of macrofaunal community composition by site (kilometer scale), vegetation type, and patch type with stand attributes (meters), and physical structure (centimeters). Differences in community composition between vegetation types at each scale indicated that mangroves and marsh grass differ as habitat for marine fauna and that wetland inhabitants can distinguish and sort among fine-grain habitat patches that co-occur within the ecotone. Such differences suggest that shifts in wetland vegetation are consequential for the protection and management of coastal populations. Studies that determine which habitat attributes shape inhabitant fauna associations can help reveal not just the spatial grain at which inhabitants associate with emerging frontier habitat but also how the redistribution of foundation species shapes the pace and resolution of broader community change.

AB Animals can be important vectors for the movement of resources across ecosystem boundaries. Animals add resources to ecosystems primarily through egestion, excretion, and carcasses, and the stoichiometry and bioavailability of these inputs likely interact with characteristics of the recipient ecosystem to determine their effects on ecosystem function. We studied the influence of hippopotamus excretion/egestion and wildebeest carcasses, and their interactions with discharge, in the Mara River, Kenya. We measured nutrient dissolution and decomposition rates of wildlife inputs, the influence of inputs on nutrient concentrations and nutrient limitation in the river and the influence of inputs on biofilm growth and function in both experimental streams and along a gradient of inputs in the river. We found that hippopotamus excretion/egestion increases ammonium and coarse particulate organic matter in the river, and wildebeest carcasses increase ammonium, soluble reactive phosphorus, and total phosphorus. Concentrations of dissolved carbon and nutrients in the water column increased along a gradient of wildlife inputs and during low discharge, although concentrations of particulate carbon decreased during low discharge due to deposition on the river bottom. Autotrophs were nitrogen limited and heterotrophs were carbon limited and nitrogen and phosphorus colimited upstream of animal inputs but there was no nutrient limitation downstream of inputs. In experimental streams, hippo and wildebeest inputs together increased biofilm gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R). These results differed in the river, where low concentrations of hippo inputs increased gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R) of biofilms, but high concentrations of hippo inputs in conjunction with wildebeest inputs decreased GPP. Our research shows that inputs from large wildlife alleviate nutrient limitation and stimulate ecosystem metabolism in the Mara River and that the extent to which these inputs subsidize the ecosystem is mediated by the quantity and quality of inputs and discharge of the river ecosystem. Thus, animal inputs provide an important ecological subsidy to this river, and animal inputs were likely important in many other rivers prior to the widespread extirpation of large wildlife.

AB The predator satiation hypothesis posits that masting helps plants escape seed predation through starvation of predators in lean years, followed by satiation of predators in mast years. Importantly, successful satiation requires sufficiently delayed bottom-up effects of seed availability on seed consumers. However, some seed consumers may be capable of quick aggregative and reproductive responses to masting, which may jeopardize positive density dependence of seed survival. We used a 17-yr data set on seed production and insect (Curculio weevils) infestation of three North American oaks species (northern red Quercus rubra, white Q. alba, and chestnut oak Q. montana) to test predictions of the predation satiation hypothesis. Furthermore, we tested for the unlagged numerical response of Curculio to acorn production. We found that masting results in a bottom-up effect on the insect population; both through increased reproductive output and aggregation at seed-rich trees. Consequently, mast seeding in two out of three studied oaks (white and chestnut oak) did not help to escape insect seed predation, whereas, in the red oak, the escape depended on the synchronization of mast crops within the population. Bottom-up effects of masting on seed consumer populations are assumed to be delayed, and therefore to have negligible effects on seed survival in mast years. Our research suggests that insect populations may be able to mount rapid reproductive and aggregative responses when seed availability increases, possibly hindering satiation effects of masting. Many insect species are able to quickly benefit from pulsed resources, making mechanisms described here potentially relevant in many other systems.

AB One of the hypothesized benefits of seed dispersal is to escape density- and distance-responsive, host-specific, natural enemies near maternal plants where conspecific seed and seedling densities are high. Such high conspecific neighbor densities typically result in lower offspring growth and survival (i.e., negative density-dependent effects), yet many dispersal modes result in clumped seed distributions. New World leaf-nosed bats transport fruits to their feeding roosts and deposit seeds, thereby creating high-density seed/seedling patches beneath feeding roosts in heterospecific trees away from maternal trees, which seemingly nullifies a key benefit of seed dispersal. Such dispersal may still be adaptive if negative density-dependent effects are reduced under feeding roosts or if the benefit of being dispersed away from maternal trees outweighs negative effects of conspecific seed/seedling density below roosts. We mapped the entire post-germination population of a bat-dispersed tree species Calophyllum longifolium (Calophyllaceae) in a 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama in each of three successive years. We tested two hypotheses: (1) distance-dependent effects are stronger than density-dependent effects on seedling performance because seedlings far from conspecific adults are more likely to escape natural enemies even when at high densities and (2) negative density-dependent effects will be reduced far from vs. near conspecific adults. Density and distance were naturally decoupled, as expected. However, in contrast to our expectation, we found positive density effects on seedling survival and density-dependent effects did not differ with distance from conspecific adults. Both density and distance had positive effects on seedling survival when considered together, while only year had a significant effect on seedling growth. Thus, both being dispersed under bat feeding roosts and escaping the vicinity of conspecific adults were beneficial for C. longifolium seedling survival, supporting the directed dispersal and escape hypotheses, respectively. Despite resulting in high densities of conspecific seedlings, favorable habitat under bat feeding roosts and lack of negative density-dependent effects appear to provide evolutionary advantages in C. longifolium.

AB Effects of species diversity on population and community stability (or more precisely, the effects of species richness on temporal variability) have been studied for several decades, but there have been no large-scale tests in natural communities of predictions from theory. We used 91 data sets including plants, fish, small mammals, zooplankton, birds, and insects, to examine the relationship between species richness and temporal variability in populations and communities. Seventy-eight of 91 data sets showed a negative relationship between species richness and population variability; 46 of these relationships were statistically significant. Only five of the 13 positive richness-population variability relationships were statistically significant. Similarly, 51 of 91 data sets showed a negative relationship between species richness and community variability; of these, 26 were statistically significant. Seven of the 40 positive richness-community-variability relationships were statistically significant. We were able to test transferability (i.e., the predictive ability of models for sites that are spatially distinct from sites that were used to build the models) for 69 of 91 data sets; 35 and 31 data sets were transferable at the population and community levels, respectively. Only four were positive at the population level, and two at the community level. We conclude that there is compelling evidence of a negative relationship between species richness and temporal variability for about one-half of the ecological communities we examined. However, species richness explained relatively little of the variability in population or community abundances and resulted in small improvements in predictive ability.

AB Density dependence (DD) controls community recovery following widespread mortality, yet this principle rarely has been applied to coral assemblages. The reefs of Mo'orea, French Polynesia, provide the opportunity to study DD of coral population growth, because coral assemblages in this location responded to declines in abundance with high recruitment and an increase in cover during which recruitment of pocilloporid corals was inversely associated with density. This study tests for DD in this system, first, by describing the context within which it operates: coral cover changed from 46% in 2005, to <1% in 2010 following an outbreak of a corallivorous sea star and a cyclone, and then increased to 74% by 2017, in large part through inverse density-associated pocilloporid recruitment. Second, a test for DD of recruitment was conducted by decreasing Pocillopora spp. cover from 33% to 19%: one year later, the density of Pocillopora spp. recruits was 1.65-fold higher in the low vs. high cover treatment. Finally, the effects of DD were investigated by comparing simulated and empirical distributions of pocilloporid colonies: as predicted by DD, small colonies were randomly distributed, while large colonies were uniformly distributed. Together these results demonstrate DD of population regulation for Pocillopora spp. corals, thus revealing the potential importance of this ecological principle in determining the resilience of coral assemblages.

AB Mortality from collision with vehicles is the most visible impact of road traffic on wildlife. Mortality due to roads (hereafter road-kill) can affect the dynamic of populations of many species and can, therefore, increase the risk of local decline or extinction. This is especially true in Brazil, where plans for road network upgrading and expansion overlaps biodiversity hotspot areas, which are of high importance for global conservation. Researchers, conservationists and road planners face the challenge to define a national strategy for road mitigation and wildlife conservation. The main goal of this dataset is a compilation of geo-referenced road-kill data from published and unpublished road surveys. This is the first Data Paper in the BRAZIL series (see ATLANTIC, NEOTROPICAL, and BRAZIL collections of Data Papers published in Ecology), which aims make public road-kill data for species in the Brazilian Regions. The dataset encompasses road-kill records from 45 personal communications and 26 studies published in peer-reviewed journals, theses and reports. The road-kill dataset comprises 21,512 records, 83% of which are identified to the species level (n = 450 species). The dataset includes records of 31 amphibian species, 90 reptile species, 229 bird species, and 99 mammal species. One species is classified as Endangered, eight as Vulnerable and twelve as Near Threatened. The species with the highest number of records are: Didelphis albiventris (n = 1,549), Volatinia jacarina (n = 1,238), Cerdocyon thous (n = 1,135), Helicops infrataeniatus (n = 802), and Rhinella icterica (n = 692). Most of the records came from southern Brazil. However, observations of the road-kill incidence for non-Least Concern species are more spread across the country. This dataset can be used to identify which taxa seems to be vulnerable to traffic, analyze temporal and spatial patterns of road-kill at local, regional and national scales and also used to understand the effects of road-kill on population persistence. It may also contribute to studies that aims to understand the influence of landscape and environmental influences on road-kills, improve our knowledge on road-related strategies on biodiversity conservation and be used as complementary information on large-scale and macroecological studies. No copyright or proprietary restrictions are associated with the use of this data set other than citation of this Data Paper.

AB Intraspecific trait variation is receiving renewed interest as a factor affecting the structure of multi-species communities within and across trophic levels. One pervasive form of intraspecific trait variation is sexual dimorphism in animals and plants, which might exert large effects particularly on the communities of host-associated organisms, but the extent of these effects is not well understood. We investigated whether host-associated microbial communities developed differently in the floral nectar of female and male individuals of the dioecious shrubs, Eurya emarginata and E. japonica. We found that nectar-colonizing microbes such as bacteria and fungi were more than twice as prevalent and, overall, more than 10 times as abundant in male flowers as in female flowers. Microbial species composition also differed between flower sexes. To examine potential mechanisms behind these differences, we manipulated the frequency of flower visitation by animals and the order of arrival of microbial species to nectar. Animal visitation frequency affected microbial communities more greatly in male flowers, while arrival order affected them more in female flowers. These sex-specific effects appeared attributable to differences in how animals and microbes altered the chemical characteristics of nectar that limited microbial growth. Taken together, our results provide evidence that sexual dimorphism can have large effects on the structure of host-associated communities.

AB Theoretical studies of marine protected areas (MPAs) suggest that more mobile species should exhibit reduced local effects (defined as the ratio of the density inside vs. outside of the MPA). However, empirical studies have not supported the expected negative relationship between the local effect and mobility. We propose that differential, habitat-dependent movement (i.e., a higher movement rate in the fishing grounds than in the MPA) might explain the disparity between theoretical expectations and empirical results. We evaluate this hypothesis by building two-patch box and stepping-stone models and show that increasing disparity in the habitat-specific movement rates shifts the relationship between the local effect and mobility from negative (the previous theoretical results) to neutral or positive (the empirical pattern). This shift from negative to positive occurs when differential movement offsets recruitment and mortality differences between the two habitats. Thus, local effects of MPAs might be caused by behavioral responses via differential movement rather than by, or in addition to, reductions in mortality. In addition, the benefits of MPAs, in terms of regional abundance and fishing yields, can be altered by the magnitude of differential movement. Thus, our study points to a need for empirical investigations that disentangle the interactions among mobility, differential movement, and protection.
