AB Comparisons between closely related radiations in different environments provide a unique window into understanding how abiotic and biotic factors shape evolutionary pathways. Anolis lizards have radiated extensively in the West Indies, as well as mainland Central and South America. In the Caribbean, similar communities of anole species specialized for different habitats (ecomorphs) have evolved independently on each Greater Antillean island. We examined ecological and morphological data on 49 Anolis species (33 Caribbean, 16 mainland) to investigate whether the same set of ecomorphs has arisen in mainland regions. More generally, we investigated whether the relationship between ecology and morphology was similar among anoles in the two regions.
   Radiations in the two regions are very different. The majority of mainland anole species exhibit morphological characteristics unlike any Caribbean ecomorph. Furthermore, relationships between ecology and morphology are very different between the two sets of anole species. Among mainland anole species, toepad size is positively correlated with perch height, whereas tail length is negatively related to perch diameter. In contrast, among Caribbean anole species, both forelimb length and body mass are positively associated with perch diameter, and both tail length and hindlimb length are negatively related to perch diameter. Biomechanical considerations provide a functional basis for some of these correlations, but much variation remains to be explained. These findings demonstrate that factors that caused anole species to converge repeatedly in the West Indies are not present in mainland regions, and that environmental factors can strongly influence the shape of evolutionary radiations.

AB For organisms with indeterminate growth, life history theory predicts that in environments where organisms experience high survival rates or gain fecundity with age or size, natural selection favors delayed maturity. In semelparous perennial plants the onset of reproduction is regulated by a threshold size for flowering. We tested this prediction by comparing sand dune populations of the facultative biennial herb Cynoglossum officinale. We collected data on flowering probability, survival, and growth rate in relation to plant size in two habitat types, open areas and poplar thickets, in Meijendel, The Netherlands, and in Holkham, England. Survival of established rosettes was highest in Holkham and lowest in open areas in Meijendel. Relative growth rates in Holkham were about three times as high as those in Meijendel. These findings agreed with the differences in threshold sizes found among the sites: the Holkham field population harbored higher threshold sizes than the Meijendel sites. We used the field data to compare optimal threshold sizes for flowering predicted by three existing models, All three models gave the same rank order for threshold sizes as found in the field: Meijendel open < Meijendel poplar thicket < Holkham. One model, which maximized population growth rate lambda, predicted optimal threshold sizes that agreed very well with threshold sizes found in the field. The predictions of the two other models, both maximizing R-0, were consistently lower than the threshold sizes observed in Meijendel, while their predictions for Holkham were too high.

AB The tremendous increase in precipitation associated with the 1992-1993 El Nino profoundly affected terrestrial communities on arid islands in the Midriff region of the Gulf of California. In 1992, winter precipitation was 5.4 times the historical mean, and winter precipitation over the entire El Nino was the highest two-year amount ever recorded. Increased precipitation led to an explosion of annual plant growth on the previously barren (0-4% cover) islands: plant cover increased 10-160 times over what it had been. With the resumption of arid conditions in 1994, live plant cover returned to the low levels seen before the onset of El Nino.
   Insect abundance tracked this pulse in plant productivity and approximately doubled in 1992 and 1993 compared to 1991 levels. In 1994, the crash of annual plants caused insect densities to drop to the lowest levels recorded during the 5-yr study. El Nino also affected the composition of the insect assemblage. In the dry years 1990-1991, the assemblage was dominated by insects feeding on products originating in the ocean: detritivores/scavengers on shore drift of marine algae and carcasses, avian parasites, and detritivores of bird products. Herbivores were extremely rare. The heavy plant growth in 1992 stimulated large (40-190 times pre-El Nino levels) increases in herbivores.
   The great increases in land plant biomass and insect abundance are indicative of an important change in the dynamics of this system. Previously, most material flowing through the food webs of these islands originated directly or indirectly in the ocean. In contrast, during this El Nino, most material originated via productivity by terrestrial plants. Thus, wet El Ninos represent an agent that switches the system from one dependent primarily on allochthonous input to a system driven to a greater extent by in situ productivity. The influence of this pulse of terrestrial productivity extends beyond the El Nino years: the persistence and slow release of plant and detrital biomass reserves may also greatly affect dynamics for years after the El Nino event has passed. We suggest that large-scale climatic events such as El Nino may be long-lasting determinants of community dynamics rather than occasional disturbance events.

AB The long-term (5-yr) responses of plant absolute abundance and species diversity to N, P, and N+P fertilization were investigated in two sedge-dominated alpine plant communities that differed in soil resource availability but not in macroclimate: a resource-poor dry meadow and a more resource-rich wet meadow. Prior to analysis, species were grouped into functional groups based on growth form, potential developmental constraints, and presence or absence of mutualisms. Absolute abundance changes of functional groups were more pronounced in the dry-meadow community than in the wet-meadow community. In the dry meadow, mycorrhizal forbs increased with N+P fertilization, nonmycorrhizal forbs increased with P and N+P, and N-2-fixing forbs increased with P alone. Grasses increased with N and N+P, whereas sedges, the dominant functional group, were unaffected by fertilization. In the wet meadow, the dominant sedges exhibited abundance increases in response to N, whereas grasses increased with P and N+P. Wet-meadow forb abundance was not significantly influenced by fertilization. Shifts in relative abundances of species resulted in an increase in species diversity following N+P fertilization in the dry meadow, and a decrease in species diversity following N+P fertilization in the wet meadow. This study, therefore, allowed a direct comparison of diversity responses between communities that differed primarily in soil resource availability, substantiating the theory that plant species diversity is greatest under intermediate levels of fertility.

AB Spatial variability that occurs at large scales has long been used by ecologists as a tool to examine the controls over ecosystem structure and function. Correlations of control variables such as climatic factors and response variables such as vegetation and soil carbon storage across broad regions have played a crucial role in predicting the response of ecosystems to global climate change. Despite the importance of these large-scale space-for-time substitutions, there are substantial limitations. One of these limitations is that many of the possible control factors covary with one another, and only some of the important control factors actually exist in large-scale databases. Thus, the true proximal controls may be difficult to identify. A second limitation is that models of spatial variability may not be appropriately applied to temporal variability.
   In this paper, we utilize a new approach to determine the extent to which N availability may constrain aboveground primary productivity in the Central Grassland region of the U.S. The strong relationship between average annual primary production and average annual precipitation found in spatial patterns in ecosystems globally has often been interpreted as evidence of a fundamental water limitation. However, temporal variation in annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) indicates that other factors constrain production. We generated a spatial and temporal database for annual aboveground net primary production and annual net N mineralization by linking a database of input variables (precipitation, temperature, and soils) with predictive models. We generated independent data sets of aboveground net primary production and net N mineralization by using regression models to predict aboveground net primary production, and the Century model to simulate net N mineralization. Our analyses indicate that net primary production and net N mineralization both increase with mean annual precipitation; thus, it is not possible to separate the extent to which ANPP is controlled by water or N availability. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) increased with increasing precipitation across the region. Aboveground net primary production decreased with increasing temperature across the region, while N mineralization increased slightly, leading to decreasing (NUE) with increasing temperature. At high precipitation levels, aboveground net primary production increased and N mineralization decreased slightly with increasing soil fineness. Nitrogen use efficiency generally increased with increasing pools of soil organic matter, likely because in grasslands, the proportion of recalcitrant organic matter increases with the total organic matter pools.
   A comparison of interannual variation in net N mineralization with average spatial variation indicated a high degree of inertia in the response of N availability to precipitation levels. Our simulation results as well as field results of Lauenroth and Sala (1992) raise important questions about the applicability of space-for-time substitutions when dealing with ecosystem function. The structure of the systems appears to provide important constraints on the temporal variability that are not evident in an analysis of spatial variability.

AB Local assemblages of rodents in northern shortgrass prairie may reflect either predatory or competitive effects of northern grasshopper mice (Onychomys leucogaster) on other species such as deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). In an effort to distinguish these two types of effects, during the summer of 1994 I compared abundances, patterns of microhabitat use, and diets of P. maniculatus on four areas of shrub-dominated prairie in north-central Colorado to these characteristics on four similar sites where O. leucogaster was removed. The abundance of P. maniculatus decreased during the study on both control and removal sites, but The decline was greater on controls, where numbers of O. leucogaster increased. Declines in the abundance of P. maniculatus on individual study plots were correlated with abundances and recolonization rates of O. leucogaster. Only 6% of P. maniculatus present on controls during pre-removal trapping were captured 7 wk later, compared to 32% of those initially present on removal sites. Furthermore, changes in the number of P. maniculatus were inversely related to the amount of shrub cover on sites, suggesting that shrubs may have provided refuge from O. leucogaster, which rarely uses these microhabitats. Analyses of microhabitat use support this assertion; individual P. maniculatus increased their use of shrubs on control sites when O. leucogaster was abundant, but there were no shifts in microhabitat use on removal sites. The proportions of arthropods in the diets of the two species were similar prior to Onychomys removals, and although P. maniculatus consumed fewer arthropods as the experiment progressed, diets did not differ between control and removal sites. In addition, Ord's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ordii) increased slightly in number following removals, and western harvest mice (Reithrodontomys megalotis) colonized two removal sites. These results suggest that predatory or aggressive interference by O. leucogaster, rather than exploitative competition, was responsible for the observed changes in abundance and microhabitat use. Risk of aggression or predatory interference therefore may influence the local abundance and distribution of P. maniculatus and other small rodents on areas of shortgrass prairie where habitat characteristics permit coexistence.

AB Patterns of resource availability mold many ecological processes, but we know little about the availability of resources to consumers in nature, even for well-studied systems such as the granivorous animals of North American deserts. What we do know about seed resources in deserts is based primarily on seeds extracted from soil samples, but this might present a distorted view of resource availability if animals mostly harvest newly produced seeds before they enter the soil seed bank. In order to assess how large the distortion might be, we simultaneously monitored the seed bank and ''seed rain'' over a 19-mo period in the eastern Mojave Desert of California. The seed bank averaged approximate to 106 000 seeds/m(2) and 38 g/m(2), much higher than values reported for other North American desert sites. This corresponds roughly to the seed production of a single year, since daily seed rain averaged 262 seeds/m(2) and 0.26 g/m(2). However, input from the seed rain did not accumulate in the soil. Instead, the seed bank decreased by a daily average of 114 seeds/m(2) and 0.007 g/m(2) during our study. This suggests that virtually all seeds germinate, die, or are harvested by granivores soon after being dispersed. Large seeds comprised a greater fraction of the seed rain than of the seed bank, suggesting that such seeds are differentially depleted, probably by granivores, before they enter the soil. Because seed drop was seasonal, temporal variation comprised a significant component of among-sample variance in the seed rain. Temporal variance in the seed bank was much smaller, presumably because granivores harvested most of the seed rain. Conversely, spatial variance was a significant component for the seed bank, but not the seed rain, perhaps as a result of spatial patterns of seed harvest or seed caching by granivores. By virtue of these variance patterns, as well as other attributes, seeds in the soil present different challenges to granivores than do newly produced seeds. Our understanding of desert granivore foraging and community ecology, and of granivore-seed interactions, depends critically on choosing the appropriate measure of seed availability to granivores.

AB This paper addresses the following question: how does one relate the biological and behavioral characteristics of animals to habitat characteristics of the locations at which they are found? Ecologists often assemble data on species composition at different localities, habitat descriptions of these localities, and biological or behavioral traits of the species. These data tables are usually analysed two by two: species composition against habitat characteristics, or against behavioral data, using such methods as canonical analysis. We propose a solution to the problem of estimating the parameters describing the relationship between habitat characteristics and biology or behavior, and of testing the statistical significance of these parameters; this problem is referred to as the fourth-corner problem, from its matrix formulation. In other words, the fourth-corner method offers a way of analysing the relationships between the supplementary variables associated with the rows and columns of a binary (presence or absence) data table. The test case that motivated this study concerns a coral reef fish assemblage (280 species). Biological and behavioral characteristics of the species were used as supplementary variables for the rows, and characteristics of the environment for the columns. Parameters of the association between habitat characteristics (distance from beach, water depth, and substrate variables) and biological and behavioral traits of the species (feeding habits, ecological niche categories, size classes, egg types, activity rhythms) were estimated and tested for significance using permutations. Permutations can be performed in different ways, corresponding to different ecological hypotheses. Results were compared to predictions made independently by reef fish ecologists, in order to assess the method as well as the pertinence of the variables subjected to the analysis. The new method is shown to be applicable to a wide class of ecological problems.

AB Because ecotones often represent the physiological or competitive limit-of-distribution of species, they serve to define a species' local distribution. We take a relatively new approach to gradient analysis to quantify the changes in forest dominance (basal area of dominant tree species) and environmental factors (elevation, slope, aspect, intercepted photosynthetically active radiation [PAR], summer soil moisture, and soil depth and texture) across current lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) ecotones in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, USA. Based on canonical correspondence analysis on data from eight 20 m wide, 140-480 m long vegetation transects, we found that lodgepole pine distribution, is described generally by elevation and moisture gradients, and to a lesser degree by soil characteristics. The first two ordination axes explained 72% of the variance in forest patterns, Environmental factors significantly correlated to the first ordination axis included: elevation, summer soil moisture, and percentage sand in the soil. Environmental factors significantly correlated to the second ordination axis included: growing-season soil moisture, surface rockiness, percentage silt, and percentage clay. However, superimposed on these general environmental gradients are ecotone-specific gradients that cannot be detected by typical gradient analysis approaches using only homogeneous plots. The basal area of lodgepole pine decreased nonlinearly and more sharply toward the ecotones than did the basal area of the neighboring tree species. Stepwise multiple linear regression and path coefficient analysis models showed that the basal area gradients of lodgepole pine into spruce/fir (Picea engelmannii, Abies lasiocarpa) forests correlated with summer soil moisture; lodgepole pine gradients into lower elevation ponderosa pine (Finns ponderosa) forests correlated strongly with intercepted PAR, slope, percentage silt, soil depth, and percentage clay; and lodgepole pine gradients into limber pine (Pinus flexilis) forests correlated largely with elevation, intercepted PAR, percentage sand, and percentage clay. Furthermore, the factors controlling tree species distributions at ecotones are not symmetrical. For example, at the lodgepole pine to limber pine ecotone, different factors or different magnitudes of the same factors determined the upper limit of lodgepole pine and the lower limit of limber pine. We conclude that: (1) different factors control a species' upper and lower elevation limits: (2) unequal competition for resources occurs between tree species where their ranges overlap; and (3) generally, soil differences may not substantially restrain the movement of some forest types into neighboring types.

AB We conducted enclosure experiments over two summers in Tuesday Lake, Michigan, to assess how a gradient of zooplanktivorous fish biomass affected the dynamics of nutrients (nitrogen, N, and phosphorus, P), and their partitioning among ecosystem compartments. In both years, fish (the cyprinid Phoxinus eos) reduced the abundance of large zooplankton species and increased the biomass of phytoplankton as predicted by the top-down control hypothesis.
   Fish had strong effects on the dynamics and fluxes of N and P. Total P concentrations in the water column declined over time in all enclosures, but fish slowed the rate of decline. Thus total water column P increased with increasing fish biomass. Total N increased less strongly with increasing fish biomass, and thus the total N:P ratio decreased with increasing fish biomass. The concentrations of particulate carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in the water column also increased with increased fish biomass. Particulate N:P ratio decreased with increased fish biomass, but effects were weaker compared to effects on total N:P ratios. Nutrient ratios of the zooplankton fraction (particles >63 mu m) showed a response that was transient but consistent with observed trends in zooplankton species composition. In particular, when the large cladocerans Daphnia and Holopedium increased upon exclusion of fish, C:P and N:P ratios of the zooplankton fraction showed distinct declines, corresponding to the relatively high body P contents of these taxa.
   Phosphorus budgets revealed that fish were a net source of P to the water column, because they lost mass during the experiments, even at densities below those in the lake. However, loss of P from fish could not account for the higher total P concentration observed in enclosures with fish compared to fishless enclosures. The absolute amount of P sinking from the water column increased with increasing fish biomass but decreased when expressed as percentage of total P sinking, again suggesting that the presence of fish increases the relative retention of P the water column. The rate of decline in water column total P in the presence of fish was accurately predicted by sedimentation of P from the water column and other fluxes. Our results support the hypothesis that fish can exert major influences on the dynamics, distribution, and ratios of limiting nutrients.

AB Adult passerines commonly lose mass during the course of the breeding cycle. This loss has been ascribed to an energy deficit incurred during nesting, but recently two adaptational hypotheses have been proposed. The first, the wing-loading hypothesis, proposes that adults actively reduce mass in order to increase flight efficiency. The second, the reserve-mobilization hypothesis, proposes that females store reserves during the early stages of the breeding cycle, which they mobilize to sustain them during later stages. We tested these hypotheses by providing food supplements to House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon) breeding on a study area north of Bloomington, Illinois, during the 1990-1992 breeding seasons. Additional food had no effect on mass except late in one season. Females that were given additional food during the late-young stage in 1992 had significantly higher mass than controls, but their mass was not greater than that normally obtained by females not receiving food supplements in other years. We conclude that the results from this experimental study are consistent with the wing-loading hypothesis, and that House Wrens do not lose mass because of an energy deficit or because they mobilize reserves.

AB Introductions of exotic species provide unique opportunities to study the demographic significance of species interactions, but as yet there is little information on how mutualistic interactions affect the invasion process. A shortage of mutualists could potentially limit the rate of population growth for an invading species. The introduced shrub Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom, Leguminosae) is a pest plant on the west coast of North America. It produces flowers that are ''tripped'' open when pollinated and has a nearly obligatory relationship with resident bumble bees and honey bees. Experiments in the state of Washington showed that <1% of untripped flowers produced fruits and that outcross-pollinated flowers yielded fourfold more fruit than self-pollinated flowers, revealing apparent inbreeding depression. Mean pollinator visitation rate, as determined by the proportion of flowers tripped, varied among three years and among four populations but was low (3-30%) in every case. Two urban populations (Magnuson Park and Discovery Park in Seattle) received higher numbers of visits than two native prairie populations (Johnson Prairie and 13th Division Prairie in southwestern Washington). Hand-pollination experiments revealed significant pollinator limitation in all populations in both 1993 and 1994, with the mean increase in fruit production ranging from 280 to 2620%. Prairie populations were more pollinator limited than urban populations. Resources available for per-flower fruit production appeared to be equally available in all populations in 1993 but more available in prairie populations than in urban populations in 1994. The relationship between natural visitation and proportion fruit set per branch was a saturating curve in 1993 but a linear function in 1994 and 1995. Significant correlations were found between pollinator visitation and variation in whole-plant fruit production in all 3 yr. No evidence was found for either (1) reallocation of resources between branches within a season, or (2) a cost of reproduction between seasons in plants receiving supplemental pollen. Demographic analysis showed that a very large cost of reproduction would be required to counterbalance the increase in fecundity achieved with full pollination. Simulations of new populations invading over a short time scale (10-30 yr) demonstrated little effect of pollen limitation in the slow-growing urban populations, but a potentially large effect of increasing pollinator visitation in the rapidly invading prairie populations.

AB The shortgrass steppe of northern Colorado is characterized by patchy plant cover and associated spatial heterogeneity of soil resources. Zones of relatively high soil organic matter (SOM) under plants are maintained by direct litter inputs and physical stabilization of aeolian material. We studied the duration of plant-associated soil enrichment following plant death. We sampled soils between plants, under live plants, and under plants dead for 1, 9, and 36 mo. Live- and dead-plant soils were more enriched in total C and N than bare soils. We found a general pattern following plant death of initial active and total SOM increase due to greater litterfall than decomposition. Next, SOM decreased as substrate supplies declined, and decomposition continued. The temporal pattern depended upon SOM turnover. Though decomposition initially provided resources to maintain enriched plant-associated zones, our results suggest that enriched nutrient-supply zones under dead plants do not persist beyond several months.

AB We examined the influence of secondary metabolites (glycoalkaloids) of Solanum fruits on fruit consumption by seed dispersers and seed predators. Our goal was to determine the degree to which secondary metabolites might explain fruit-frugivore interactions that heretofore have not been explained by other fruit-related variables (e.g., color, nutrient content, seediness, etc.). Using feeding trails with real fruits and artificial fruit pulp media, we tested two sets of hypotheses, one relating to the specificity of secondary metabolites and the other to intra- and interspecific variation in secondary metabolite content. First, the Directed Toxicity Hypothesis was tested against its alternative, the General Toxicity Hypothesis. The Directed Toxicity Hypothesis posits that fruit pulp secondary metabolites are directed primarily toward organisms that destroy seeds following fruit consumption, remaining nontoxic to organisms that disperse seeds. The General Toxicity Hypothesis states that these secondary metabolites are general in their effects. Second, the Removal Rate Hypothesis was tested against its alternative, the Nutrient-Toxin Titration Hypothesis. The Removal Rate Hypothesis posits that profitable fruits, with high natural rates of removal, contain only low levels of secondary metabolites as defenses against seed predators and pathogens. In contrast, the Nutrient-Toxin Titration Hypothesis states that profitable fruits are better able to afford protection by high levels of secondary metabolites because high nutrient levels compensate for deterrent effects of secondary metabolites.
   We compared Solanum carolinense, with high levels of secondary metabolites (glycoalkaloids) in ripe fruit, and S. americanum, with negligible levels, conducting four sets of feeding trials: (1) Real Fruit trials to determine the preferences of our study animals for real fruit of each plant species; (2) Fruit Mimic trials using artificial fruit pulp media to determine the relative effects of nutrient and glycoalkaloid content on fruit preferences; (3) Interaction trials using artificial fruit pulp media to examine relative and interactive effects of the two main glycoalkaloids in our fruits (alpha-solasonine and alpha-solamargine); and (4) Nutrient-Toxin Titration trials using artificial fruit pulp media to determine how much nutrient content might compensate for deterrent effects.
   Both seed predators and seed dispersers preferred the low-glycoalkaloid S. americanum fruits and were deterred by glycoalkaloid levels typical of ripe S. carolinense fruits. Because of the generality of the deterrent effects, we rejected the Directed Toxicity Hypothesis. Additionally, we found no evidence for differences between the two glycoalkaloids in their deterrent effects, and no evidence of synergism between them. Nutrient effects were generally small; we found no evidence that nutrient variation could compensate for the deterrence produced by levels of glycoalkaloids found in ripe S. carolinense fruits. Ripe fruits of the presumably more profitable, preferred S. americanum contain much lower levels of glycoalkaloid. Taken together, our results support the Removal Rate Hypothesis. Secondary metabolites of ripe fleshy fruits are an important determinant of fruit use by frugivores. We suggest that a primary function of these metabolites is defense against pests and pathogens. Thus, these organisms should be considered an important influence on fruit-seed disperser interactions.

AB Generalist mammalian herbivores typically avoid plant species containing high levels of plant secondary compounds because generalists are thought to lack the ability to process large quantities of these chemicals. Here I propose and test two hypotheses: (1) that food-hoarding herbivores behaviorally overcome consumption limits imposed by secondary compounds by storing food until the toxins degrade; and (2) that the presence of secondary compounds in cached plant material facilitates the preservation of these items, as well as other cached items that lack such compounds. To evaluate these hypotheses, I conducted a number of field and laboratory experiments using the North American pika, Ochotona princeps, a generalist herbivore that consumes low-phenolic vegetation in the summer while it simultaneously collects and stores high-phenolic vegetation for subsequent consumption during winter.
   In experiments investigating decomposition of summer and winter diets of pikas, after 10 mo of storage, the winter diet retained 20.5% more biomass, and was higher in energy, lower in fiber, and equal in nitrogen compared to the summer diet. Moreover, a common food item in the winter diet, Acomastylis rossii, which contains high levels of phenolics, was the only plant extract to deter bacterial growth in a bioassay. Acomastylis rossii leaves with experimentally reduced phenolic levels retained significantly less biomass than leaves with natural phenolic concentrations. However, the presence of A. rossii in artificial caches containing a low-phenolic species, Trifolium parryi, did not facilitate the preservation of T. parryi.
   Approximately halfway through the typical storage period, phenolic concentrations of pika winter diet samples in artificial caches decreased to levels readily consumed by pikas in their summer diet. Examination of natural haypiles of pikas before and after storage revealed that pikas do increase their intake of A. rossii from the haypile sometime during the winter. In experiments with captive pikas, pikas preferred A. rossii with experimentally reduced phenolic concentrations over those with natural concentrations. Observations of pikas foraging from natural and artificial haypiles suggested that pikas do not increase their intake of A. rossii from the haypile until phenolics levels decrease. Taken together, the results support both of the hypotheses. Pikas manipulate plant chemistry by storing plants rich in allelochemicals and by delaying consumption of these plants until the toxins decay. Moreover, plants with high levels of secondary compounds exhibit superior preservation qualities so that more biomass and nutrients are retained during storage. As food caching is a common strategy among several animal classes and many foods contain potentially deleterious compounds, the manipulation of food toxins by storage may be a prevalent phenomenon.

AB Guppies (Poecilia reticulata) living in the streams and rivers of Trinidad show significant interpopulation variation in life history traits. Some of the greatest divergence is among guppies that co-occur with different assemblages of predators. Reznick has demonstrated that there is a genetic basis for some, but not all, of these differences. Several features of guppies' biology co-vary with the predatornities including their social and sexual behaviors and the demography of their populations. Here, we test the hypothesis that some of the observed phenotypic variation in life history traits is induced by differences in the social environment of guppies. We tested this by rearing focal individuals in the laboratory in experimental populations composed of wild-caught guppies. The experimental populations were designed to represent two types of guppy communities: (1) Rivulus communities, where guppies co-occur only with a small killifish, Rivulus hartii, that preys on small guppies, and (2) Crenicichla communities, where they co-occur with several larger species of predator including Crenicichla alta, a cichlid that prefers to prey on large guppies. We manipulated both the demography and the origin (predator community) of the guppies comprising the experimental populations. The focal guppies were offspring of guppies from one of the two predator localities. We found that guppies responded to both the demography and origin of the conspecifics with which they were reared. Therefore, phenotypic plasticity in response to social environment is probably contributing to the variation in life history traits that has been observed in the field. Our discovery that there are differences in the responsiveness of guppies from Rivulus and Crenicichla localities to our manipulations of social environment suggests that the patterns of plasticity have themselves evolved.

AB We examined the hypothesis that developmental phase changes from juvenile to mature growth in plants affect the distribution of common herbivores, which in turn affect the rest of the arthropod community. Using naturally occurring clones of cottonwoods, we compared the arthropod communities found in the mature zones of upper tree canopies, in juvenile zones at the base of mature trees, and in juvenile ramets that have suckered from the roots of mature trees. Mature zones were shown to support 23% greater species richness and 108% greater relative abundance than juvenile ramets. Of 17 common arthropod taxa, 8 showed significantly higher abundances on one developmental zone over another; 4 had higher abundances on mature zones, and 4 had higher abundances on juvenile ramets. The juvenile zones of mature trees resembled a transition zone, supporting intermediate species richness and relative abundance. We also detected a significant clone effect on arthropod relative abundance, indicating that plant development varies among clones.
   Because developmental-based resistance directly affects the distributions of the two dominant insect herbivores, we then removed these insects to quantify the indirect impacts of development on the rest of the arthropod community. The gall-forming aphid Pemphigus betae was removed from susceptible mature branches (juvenile branches and ramets are resistant), and the leaf-feeding beetle Chrysomela confluens was removed from susceptible juvenile ramets (mature branches are resistant). We found opposite impacts of removal: aphid removal decreased species richness and abundance in mature zones by 32 and 55%, respectively, while beetle removal increased species richness and abundance on juvenile ramets by 120 and 75%, respectively. These studies suggest that plant development is an important factor that contributes to the structuring of insect communities, and that the indirect impacts of plant development acting through common herbivores may rival direct impacts (e.g., competition and predation) in their overall importance. Furthermore, the habitat mosaic created by developmental processes provides a mechanism for understanding the commonly observed pattern of higher biodiversity in mixed-aged stands of trees and forest edges than in even-aged stands or forest interiors.

AB We studied the effect of habitat fragmentation on the richness, diversity, turnover, and abundance of bleeding bird communities in old, boreal mixed-wood forest by creating isolated and connected forest fragments of 1, 10, 40, and 100 ha. Connected fragments were linked by 100 m wide riparian buffer strips. Each size class within treatments and controls was replicated three times. We sampled the passerine community using point counts before, and in each of two years after, forest harvesting, accumulating 21 340 records representing 59 species. We detected no significant change in species richness as a result of the harvesting, except in the 1-ha connected fragments, where the number of species increased two years after isolation. This increase was accounted for by transient species, suggesting that the adjacent buffer strips were being used as movement corridors. Diversity (log series alpha index) was dependent on area in the isolated fragments only after cutting, having decreased in the smaller areas. Turnover rates in the isolated fragments were significantly higher than in similar connected or control areas, due to species replacement. Crowding occurred in the isolated fragments immediately after cutting, but two years after fragmentation, the responses in abundance of species varied with migratory strategy. Numbers of Neotropical migrants declined in both connected and isolated fragments, and resident species declined in isolated fragments. Most species in these groups require older forest, many favoring interior areas. Abundance df short-distance migrants, most of which are habitat generalists, did not change. Overall, although there was no decrease in species richness from our recently fragmented areas, community structure was altered; maintaining connections between fragments helped to mitigate these effects. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the fragmentation effects we documented is small compared with those observed elsewhere. Birds breeding in the boreal forest, where frequent small-and large-scale natural disturbances have occurred historically, may be more resilient to human-induced habitat changes, such as those caused by forest harvesting. However, these results should be interpreted with caution. First, they are short-term and address only broad-scale community responses based on species richness and relative abundance. Second, the study area was embedded in a landscape where large areas of old, mixed forest are still available, potentially dampening any local-scale impacts of fragmentation.

AB Plants can employ two general strategies to defend themselves against herbivory: they can either reduce the amount of damage they experience (resistance), or they can tolerate herbivore damage. Theoretical considerations suggest that, in many cases, tolerance and resistance are redundant strategies, and may therefore be mutually exclusive adaptations. In this investigation of natural populations of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana we examine whether the pattern of selection acting on resistance and tolerance favors the evolution of one defense strategy, or the other, but not both. We found that the joint pattern of selection acting on tolerance and two resistance traits, trichome density and total glucosinolate concentration, indicated that there were not alternate peaks in the fitness landscape favoring either resistance or tolerance. Rather, selection favored the retention of both tolerance and resistance. One reason for the absence of mutually exclusive alternative resistance/tolerance strategies is the absence of a negative genetic correlation between resistance and tolerance. An unexpected result is the detection of disruptive selection acting on tolerance, which seems to result from a nonlinear relationship between tolerance and its costs.

AB Two very different factors favor generalist herbivores over specialist herbivores: greater resource availability, which should be universally beneficial, and the possibility of mixing foods to improve nutrient balance or to reduce exposure to high levels of particular allelochemicals. In this work, four species of Lepidoptera and three species of Hemiptera were fed single or mixed foods to test the hypothesis that individual generalists would benefit from mixing their diets. In all cases, insects were provided with one of three different host plants, or a mixture of all three. For most species, several different experiments were performed. Survivorship, gain in mass, and fecundity were used as measures of performance. In no case was there evidence that mixtures were better than single foods. It is argued that, in these taxa, the value of being a generalist lies largely with versatility for use of different hosts, rather than for dietary mixing. The contrast with Orthoptera, in which individuals commonly obtain substantial benefit from dietary mixing, is also discussed.

AB Prey availability for site-attached planktivorous fish is delimited not only by the density of their prey, but also by the speed of the waters that carry the prey. The effects of both flow speed and prey density on the feeding rates of coral reef dwelling planktivorous fish were examined under controlled laboratory conditions. Fish placed inside a large recirculating flow chamber exhibited a limited enhancement of feeding rates following the increase of flow speed from 3 to 18 cm/s. Feeding rates peaked between 6 and 12 cm/s and appeared to decline upon subsequent increases in speed. Saturation of feeding rates did not correspond directly with prey flux, as higher rates were achieved at ''higher prey density-lower flow speed'' treatments of equal flux.
   Video analysis of fish movements while foraging, together with experimentation involving fish feeding under restricted spatial conditions, indicated the narrowing of the fishes' reactive volume with increasing flow speed. The dependence of reactive volume size on flow speed was incorporated into the Holling disk equation and shown to reproduce much of the observed trends. Disparities between the observed and predicted dependence of feeding rates on flow speed suggest additional effects of flow speed on search efficiency parameters, such as prey detectability and capture success.

AB Recent increases in woody plant density have occurred in grasslands worldwide, but both the cause and mechanisms involved in these changes have been elusive. Changes in grass biomass mediated by high levels of constant herbivory seem to be the pivotal reason. In this field study in central Texas, USA, effects of aboveground and belowground interference on the growth of seedlings of a deep-rooted, woody heliophyte, Prosopis glandulosa, were tested. The effects of two positions (gap or Bouteloua curtipendula grassland), two levels of aboveground interference (high or low light), and three levels of grass root interference (2, 20, and 40 cm deep root excluders) on P. glandulosa aboveground, belowground, and total dry mass were measured. The exclusion of belowground interference significantly increased aboveground, belowground, and total P. glandulosa dry mass, with the reduction of belowground interference to a depth of 20 cm maximizing P. glandulosa dry mass. Aboveground, belowground, and total dry mass of P. glandulosa were not significantly different when grown in gaps compared to grasslands, nor were there any significant differences when aboveground interference (shade) was imposed. However, the trend was for greater dry mass in gaps and high light. Data indicate that belowground interference from grass roots significantly reduces the dry mass of P. glandulosa, while aboveground interference has a lesser effect.

AB We measured aboveground plant biomass, aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), detritus accumulation, and nitrogen and phosphorus uptake by above-ground vegetation in six Metrosideros polymorpha stands on the windward slopes of Mauna Loa, Hawai'i, USA. Our objective was to quantify the effects of elevation (primarily temperature) on ecosystem properties during primary succession, as a key to understanding ecosystem-climate interactions. Four study sites were on 111- to 136-yr-old lava flows at elevations of 290, 700, 1130, and 1660 m. Two additional sites on 3400-yr-old lava were at 700 and 1660 m elevations. All sites were on solid pahoehoe (smooth or ropy-textured) lava substrates with gentle relief, were free of significant human disturbance, received abundant precipitation, and had similar vegetation composition. Total aboveground biomass, soil organic matter mass, and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) were all greater in the old sites than in young sites. Differences between young and old sites in aboveground live biomass, detrital mass, and ANPP all supported the conclusion that ecosystem development proceeded relatively faster at 700 m elevation than at 1660 m. However, aboveground biomass in the old sites (81 Mg/ha at 1660 m elevation and 123 Mg/ha at 700 m) was low in comparison with other wet tropical forests. Accumulations of N and P in live biomass and detritus followed the same trends as were observed for organic matter. Rates of soil carbon accumulation over the first 3400 yr of succession averaged 2.1 g.m(-2).yr(-1), similar to other reported soil chronosequences. Observed rates of N accumulation ranged from 0.1 to 0.6 g.m(-2).yr(-1) over the first 136 yr of succession. There were no monotonic elevational trends among young sites with respect to live biomass, detritus mass, or total N or P accumulation. Foliar nitrogen concentrations in the young sites were among the lowest reported from any tropical forests and tended to decline with increasing elevation. The growth and biomass of individual plant species varied in distinctive ways along the elevational gradient. Nevertheless, among young sites there was a direct, linear relationship between total ANPP and mean annual temperature of the site, with a similar pattern in the two old sites. For each 1 degrees C increase in mean annual temperature, total ANPP increased by 54 g.m(-2).yr(-1). Community-level ANPP also was directly correlated with rates of N and P uptake by the vegetation, regardless of site age or elevation.

AB The importance of dispersal for population genetics, population dynamics, and conservation biology is well established. We studied natal dispersal of Great Tits between Wytham Wood (high-quality habitat), and hedgerows and small woodlands within 2 km of Wytham Wood (the ''surrounding area''; low-quality habitat). We (1) quantified the exchange of birds between these habitats, and (2) evaluated whether there was phenotypic variation between dispersing and philopatric birds. Only 6% of immigrants in Wytham were born in the surrounding area, and only 5% of emigrant recruits from Wytham bred in the surrounding area. This indicates that most nonphilopatric birds dispersed >2 km, considerably farther than expected. The effect of sex on dispersal depends on the scale on which it is studied: females dispersed longer distances than males, but the exchange of birds between woodlands was not sex biased. The proportion of immigrants among breeding birds was similar for both sexes, confirming the latter result. Dispersing and philopatric birds did not differ in hatch date, but birds that hatched in the surrounding area and dispersed into Wytham had greater nestling mass than those that did not. This effect was not found in Wytham, suggesting that there is an interaction between phenotypic quality and habitat quality with respect to dispersal: birds of high phenotypic quality disperse when they are born in low-quality habitat. As a result, birds breeding in Wytham (high-quality) had greater mass as nestlings than birds breeding in the surrounding area (low-quality). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that conditions during early development have an affect on the quality of the environment in which a bird subsequently reproduces.

AB A demographic model is developed based on interbirth intervals and is applied to estimate the population growth rate of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the Gulf of Maine. Fecundity rates in this model are based on the probabilities of giving birth at time t after a previous birth and on the probabilities of giving birth first at age x. Maximum likelihood methods are used to estimate these probabilities using sighting data collected for individually identified whales. Female survival rates are estimated from these same sighting data using a modified Jolly-Seber method. The youngest age at first parturition is 5 yr, the estimated mean birth interval is 2.38 yr (se = 0.10 yr), the estimated noncalf survival rate is 0.960 (se = 0.008), and the estimated calf survival rate is 0.875 (se = 0.047). The population growth rate (lambda) is estimated to be 1.065; its standard error is estimated as 0.012 using a Monte Carlo approach, which simulated sampling from a hypothetical population of whales. The simulation is also used to investigate the bias in estimating birth intervals by previous methods. The approach developed here is applicable to studies of other populations for which individual interbirth intervals can be measured.

AB The generality of relationships between soil net nitrogen (N) mineralization, aboveground N cycling, and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) for temperate forest ecosystems is unclear. It is also not known whether these variables and their relationships differ between evergreen and deciduous forests, or across soil types. To address these questions we compiled data on annual rates of in situ net N mineralization and ANPP for 16 conifer and 34 hardwood forests, including plantations and natural stands on a range of soils at six locations in Wisconsin and Minnesota, USA. For 31 natural stands, 48 stands with native species (including plantations), and all data, ANPP increased linearly with annual net N mineralization rates. Native evergreen conifer and two deciduous hardwood types (oaks and mesic hardwoods) followed similar patterns in this regression, indicating common functional relationships at the ecosystem level. The relationship of N mineralization and ANPP differed between finer textured Alfisol soils and sandier Entisols, with higher ANPP at any given N mineralization level in Alfisols. A multiple regression of N mineralization on soil texture (percentage silt plus clay), litterfall N, and mean annual temperature explained 81% of the variance in annual N mineralization for natural stands, and a multiple regression of ANPP on soil texture and annual N mineralization rate explained 83% of the variance in ANPP.
   Naturally regenerated forest types differed in mean annual net N mineralization, litterfall N, and ANPP, and all were greater in oaks than in mesic hardwoods or conifers, respectively. However, differences among the 50 stands and six locations were largely a result of differences in soils and stand origin. For all natural hardwood stands, ANPP and N mineralization were greater on fine-textured Alfisols than on sandy Entisols. For evergreen conifers, ANPP and N mineralization were greater in plantations on Alfisols than in natural stands on Histosols, Entisols, or Spodosols. Hardwood and evergreen conifer stands did not differ significantly in ANPP or N mineralization on comparable soils and stand origin: they differed neither as plantations on Alfisols nor as natural stands on Entisols. This suggests that observed average differences among natural forest types in ANPP and N mineralization resulted largely from variation in their distribution on differing soils, and not from feedback effects on N mineralization or differing productivity per available N.
   These data suggest that, at a regional scale, at least half of the variation in ANPP can be attributed to variation in annual N mineralization. Both ANPP and N mineralization differ more strongly with soil type/parent material than with forest type; ANPP at any given level of N mineralization is higher on silty/loamy Alfisols than on sandy Entisols, Histosols, or Spodosols, but not different for coniferous and broad-leaved deciduous species. There is no indication of N saturation of ANPP within the range of natural N availability in these forests.

AB We compare the demography of natural populations of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) coexisting with two different communities of predators. In some populations, guppies co-occur with Rivulus hartii, a small, gape-limited predator; in others, guppies co-occur with larger species of fish that also prey on guppies. We found an association between the demography of the resident guppy population and the species of predator(s) present at a site. Populations of guppies that co-occurred with Rivulus had fewer small, immature guppies and more mid- and large-sized, mature guppies than populations of guppies that lived in the community of larger predators. The sex ratio of adult guppies did not differ between predator localities but it was significantly more variable among sites with the small predator. Ninety percent of all samples had a female-biased sex ratio. Season (wet vs. dry season) did not have a statistically significant influence on sex ratio or on stage or size distributions.
   The observed variation in guppy demography could be simply a result of differences in the prey size preferences of the predators. However, guppies from the two types of localities show considerable differences in life history traits, including age at maturity and fecundity. This variation in traits could be contributing to the differences in demography. Indeed, results from an individual-based computer model suggest that fecundity, offspring size, and individual growth rates were most influential in producing interlocality differences in size distributions and the proportions of the populations that were immature. Mortality rates. and individual growth rates seem to make the greatest contribution to variation in adult sex ratio. Therefore, the observed patterns in the demography of these populations appear to result from complex interactions between the mortality schedules and life history traits of their constituents.

AB The extent to which species richness in local communities is determined by regional and historical processes is not well understood. An increasingly popular way to investigate these large-scale processes is through regressions of local on regional species richness. We sampled local and regional species richness in a broad array of taxa from around the world to address five questions. First, is the relationship between local and regional species richness linear, or does local richness accumulate more slowly at progressively higher regional diversities, suggesting local saturation of species diversity? Second, do these relationships vary with locality size? Third, do taxa and continents differ in the form of relationships between local and regional diversity? Fourth, do relationships between local and regional diversity depart from that expected from a null model in which all individuals of a locality are randomly sampled from a regional pool of species whose abundances have a canonical log-normal distribution? Fifth, using this same null model, how does the expected relationship between local and regional species richness depend on the sampling intensity within localities? We used distribution maps to ensure that diversity was sampled in a consistent manner across diverse taxa. Each region was 500 x 500 km, and localities were 1% and 10% of the region size.
   There was no evidence of local species saturation, as local species richness was strongly and linearly related to regional richness at both spatial scales. Between scales, local diversity accumulated faster as a function of regional diversity at the larger spatial scale. The slope of this relationship between local and regional diversity was the same among taxa across continents, and between Australia and North America across taxa. In other words, at each spatial scale one relationship between local and regional diversity describes most cases very well. The null model showed that approximately linear relationships between local and regional diversity are expected when regional species abundances are log-normal and when the number of individuals sampled within localities is large (roughly 200 times the number of species in the most species-rich region examined). However, empirical slopes were less than expected from the null model, which we interpret as an effect of spatial turnover of species (beta diversity). Since these slopes were nevertheless similar among taxa and between regions, rates of spatial turnover must be approximately the same among these taxa and regions. The log-normal model also showed that nonlinear (concave down) relationships between local and regional diversity are expected under random sampling when sample size is small relative to regional diversity. Therefore, nonlinear relationships are not necessarily indicative of saturation. Our results suggest that at the scales investigated here local communities are unsaturated and that their diversities are strongly limited by species richness of the surrounding regions. Similarity between taxa and continents in the form of the local-regional diversity relationship implies that ''rules'' governing the assembly of local communities may be widely consistent. If so, understanding species diversity in local assemblages will require knowledge of processes acting at larger spatial scales, including determinants of regional species richness and spatial turnover of species.

AB Morphological plasticity is common among clonal organisms, including scleractinian corals, yet the role of phenotypic plasticity in coral ecology and evolution is largely unexplored. Additionally, it is unclear how much variation in plastic responses exists among individuals, populations, and species, and thus how much potential there is for natural selection to act on coral reaction norms. In the branching coral Madracis mirabilis, corallite architecture and density, branch diameter and spacing, and overall aggregate morphology all vary among environments. To examine the role of phenotypic plasticity in generating these patterns, clonal replicates of five genotypes of M. mirabilis were transplanted from each of two source populations into four treatment environments on the north coast of Jamaica. Flow rate, sedimentation, irradiance, water temperature, and salinity all varied among these environments. DNA fingerprinting was used to ensure that the 10 transplanted genotypes were genetically distinct. Six morphological traits (intersepta area, septa length, columella area, corallite area, corallite spacing, and branch tip diameter) were measured after transplantation to determine whether they were altered in response to environmental conditions. Because these traits were correlated, principal components analysis was used to define new, uncorrelated traits for analysis. Four of the five corallite traits and branch diameter were significantly affected by the environment, demonstrating that morphological variation among environments in M. mirabilis is due in large part to phenotypic plasticity. No difference was detected between the two source populations in the magnitude or direction of their plastic responses, but there was substantial variation among genotypes (genotype x environment interaction). Many of the phenotypic changes of both populations resulted in the transplants becoming morphologically similar to resident conspecifics in each treatment environment. Genotypes from both populations were able to maintain similar growth rates under diverse environmental conditions. Such morphological convergence by phenotypic plasticity may expand the ecological range of this species by enabling genotypes to tolerate spatially and temporally variable environments.

AB Tallgrass prairie in the Flint Hills region of Kansas is characterized by considerable topographic relief coupled with variation in soil properties. These topoedaphic gradients, together with variation in fire regimes, result in temporal and landscape-level variability in soil resource availability and plant responses. Nitrogen usually is considered to be the nutrient most limiting to primary productivity in tallgrass prairie, but few studies have addressed how N availability varies seasonally, or across the landscape and with fire frequency. We measured soil inorganic N, in situ net N mineralization, aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), and N mass on plots either fertilized with N in 1993 or in 1994, or unfertilized, in uplands and lowlands of two annually burned and two long-term unburned sites during the 1994 growing season. In addition, our study was conducted in the year following record rainfall, allowing us to assess the potential for high precipitation amounts to affect subsequent N cycling and plant production. Both fire treatment and topography affected soil N availability. In general, N mineralization was greater on unburned than on burned sites and was up to five times greater on uplands than lowlands. Total extractable soil N was highest early in the season and least at midseason, and it also tended to be higher in unburned sites than burned sites on unfertilized plots. Added N increased ANPP, but there were no differences between plots fertilized in 1994 and those fertilized in 1993. In general, patterns of ANPP on control plots were consistent with known production responses to topography and burning (higher in annually burned sites and in lowland sites) but were inversely related or unrelated to patterns of N availability (higher in unburned sites and at upland topographic positions). Potential loss of N by volatilization during spring burning was greater than in years with normal rainfall amounts and represented a significant portion of aboveground plant N mass. Potential N losses did not appear to limit ANPP or N availability in the current growing season. Our results suggest that different factors control soil N mineralization and plant productivity, which explains, in part, why patterns of ANPP are not well correlated with patterns of N availability in tallgrass prairie ecosystems.

AB We reconstructed a 3500-yr history of fluctuations in treeline elevation and tree abundance in the southern Sierra Nevada. Treeline elevation was higher than at present throughout most of the last 3500 yr. Declines in the abundance of live trees and treeline elevation occurred twice during the last 1000 yr: from 950 to 550 yr BP and from 450 to 50 yr BP. The earlier decline coincided with a period of warm temperatures (relative to present) in which at least two severe, multidecadal droughts occurred. This decline was apparently triggered by an increase in the rate of adult mortality in treeline forests. The more recent decline occurred during a period of low temperatures lasting for up to 400 yr and was apparently caused by a sustained failure of regeneration in combination with an increased rate of adult mortality. The apparent past importance of precipitation in controlling the position and structure of the treeline ecotone suggests that climatic controls over treeline may be more complex than previously thought. In the Sierra Nevada, responses of high-elevation forests to future warming may depend strongly on water supply.

AB Food limitation on reproduction during the nestling stage was experimentally tested in a Finnish population of Eurasian Kestrels (Falco tinnunculus). Nests were provided with supplemental food from hatching to fledging for three years (1992, 1993, and 1995), which differed in the natural abundance of voles, the Eurasian Kestrel's major prey. These supplemented nests were compared to nonsupplemented control nests using the following variables: (1) parental effort, (2) parental condition, and (3) fledgling number and quality. Female parents responded to food supplements by decreasing their hunting effort (estimated as the percentage of time spent flight-hunting) and prey delivery rate, whereas the hunting effort and/or prey delivery rate of males did not change. Females at supplemented nests were heavier than those at control nests, but the body mass of males was not affected by feeding. Supplementary food increased the number of fledglings per brood not only in years of low, but also in years of relatively high natural prey density. We conclude that even at high levels of natural food abundance, the reproductive output of kestrels is food-limited during the nestling period. In addition, there appear to be intersexual differences in the adjustment of parental effort. While females adjusted parental effort to male provisioning and offspring requirements, males did not change parental effort within a season, suggesting that male parental effort is fixed at a level where male survival is not jeopardized.

AB To evaluate possible evolutionary links between plant-herbivore and plant-pollinator relationships, defense and reward characteristics and pollination ecology were mapped onto a morphologically estimated phylogeny of 42 species of Dalechampia. This procedure generated detailed hypotheses about the evolution of anti-herbivore defense and pollination systems. These hypotheses were tested using the results of chemical analyses and bioassays of foliar and floral secretions.
   Multiple lines of defense appear to have evolved in sequence in Dalechampia. The first defense system to originate was deployment of triterpene resins to defend the staminate flowers, This feature was a preaptation (preadaptation) that allowed the evolution of a resin-based, pollinator-reward system. Thus pollination by resin-collecting bees originated as a ''transfer exaptation'' (a new function replaced the old). This hypothesis is supported by anti-herbivore activities of floral resins and by chemical similarity of floral defense and reward resins. After the resin defense of flowers was lost by conversion into a reward system, there followed (in evolutionary time) a sequence of defensive innovations. These included nocturnal closure of large, involucral bracts to protect both staminate and pistillate flowers. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the large bracts themselves probably originated as a floral advertisement system, and the bracts assumed a defensive function through ''addition exaptation'' (a new function was added to the old). Additional lines of defense to evolve were deployment of resin to defend the developing ovaries and seeds (an addition exaptation), deployment of sharp, detaching trichomes on enveloping sepals to defend developing seeds (apparent adaptations), closure of involucral bracts around the developing fruits and seeds (an addition exaptation), and deployment of resin to defend the leaves and growing shoot tips (also an addition exaptation). Support for this scenario also derives from the chemical similarities of sepal, foliar, and floral resins, and the anti-herbivore properties of foliar resins. It appears that at least one pollinator-reward system originated by modification of a defense system, and several defense systems originated by modification of pollinator reward and advertisement systems. Thus exaptations have been important in the origin of new defense and pollination systems, and each system has significantly influenced the evolution of the other on several occasions.

AB Theoretical models for the evolution of inducible anti-predator defenses predict that there should be fitness costs associated with the defense, otherwise it should be permanent. Thus, in the absence of predators and with limited resources, defended individuals are expected to be outcompeted by individuals lacking the costly defense. Crucian carp, Carassius carassius, increase in body depth in response to chemical stimuli from piscivorous fish, and the deeper body constitutes a morphological defense against gape-limited piscivores. Here, we have performed a field experiment investigating effects of population density on the relative competitive performance of shallow-bodied and deep-bodied crucian carp. We assigned groups of six individually marked fish (the ''focal'' individuals) of either morph into enclosures with either low or high crucian carp density, and monitored changes in body mass, length, and body depth of these fish for 4 mo. In addition, we determined sex, and final liver and gonadal mass, of all focal fish.
   At high population density, there was a reduction in food resources (zooplankters), which resulted in reduced gonad mass, reduced gonadosomatic indices, and reduced growth in fish of both morphs. Unexpectedly, the relative allocation to livers was higher at high density. There was no difference in body mass gain between morphs at the low density, whereas at the high density shallow-bodied fish gained twice as much body mass as deep-bodied fish. Hence, when predators were absent and food resources were limited, deep-bodied individuals suffered a substantial cost when competing with shallow-bodied conspecifics.
   This study verifies the theoretical prediction that an inducible defense results in fitness costs in the absence of predators. Further, as we found no measurable disadvantage of the deep-bodied morphology at high food availability but a strong disadvantage under intense competition for food, our results also demonstrate the importance of relating defense costs to levels of intraspecific competition.

AB Previous explanations for the evolution of induced resistance of plants to herbivory emphasized arguments based on saving costs when allocations to defense were not needed; these models met with limited empirical support. We offer a novel explanation based on induced resistance providing increased variability in defense. As long as maximal levels of defense are constrained, variability will increase the effectiveness of a given level of investment in defense. We show that variability can decrease herbivore performance if herbivore performance is a concave function of the level of resistance. In particular if herbivores can choose among different plants and plant tissues, then variability created by induced resistance may benefit plants under attack and hence may be favored by selection. The key assumptions of this model are broadly supported by empirical data from many plant-herbivore systems.

AB We examined the effects of three allelochemicals found in tomato (chlorogenic acid, rutin, and tomatine) and two thermal regimes (21 degrees:10 degrees C and 26 degrees:15 degrees C, representing spring and summer, respectively) on the performance of a generalist insect predator (Podisus maculiventris: Pentatomidae) fed prey containing those allelochemicals. The prey were Manduca sexta (Sphingidae) caterpillars, Solanaceae specialists with a preference for tomato. Whether an allelochemical had a negative, neutral, or positive effect on developmental time or mass gained by the predators depended on thermal regime and the combination of allelochemicals in the prey's diet. The effects of multiple allelochemicals were not always additive. For the most part, the allelochemicals had greater negative effects at the warmer thermal regime. Effects of allelochemicals also depended on the stage of the predator. Individually, chlorogenic acid and rutin prolonged developmental time of second-instar nymphs. In contrast, only rutin and tomatine together affected developmental time of fourth-instar nymphs, and this combination of allelochemicals reduced developmental time. Tomatine substantially reduced mass gained by second-instar nymphs but had no effect on mass gained by fourth-instar nymphs. Rutin and tomatine together had no effect on second-instar nymphs but increased the mass of fourth-instar nymphs. There were no allelochemical by temperature interactions for second-instar nymphs, whereas allelochemical by temperature interactions influenced stadium duration, final dry mass, and relative growth rate of fourth-instar nymphs. Rutin and tomatine together eliminated the negative effect of chlorogenic acid on consumption of prey by the fourth-instar nymphs. Chlorogenic acid by itself and rutin and tomatine together increased the efficiency of conversion of ingested prey to nymphal biomass. Comparison with an earlier study revealed that the effects of these thermal and dietary conditions were distinctly different for prey and predators, which suggests that such conditions would promote developmental asynchrony between prey and predator populations.

AB Allocation processes play a central role in life history theories. Yet very few studies have been carried out on the link between foraging and life history in the context of allocation of resources. Here we report a study examining the relationship between foraging and allocation of resources in the Wandering Albatross Diomedea exulans of Crozet Islands. We simultaneously studied individual foraging strategies at sea and differential allocation to reproduction and storage by measuring the energy supplied to chicks and the variation of body mass of the adult. Satellite tracking and continuous monitoring of nest attendance by adults showed that while rearing a chick Wandering Albatrosses have two specific alternative foraging strategies. They either forage in short trips, short in duration and close to the colony over the southeastern slope of the peri-insular shelf, or in long trips far from the colony in the oceanic waters north of Crozet. On average, birds made five successive short trips before making a long trip. Chicks received a meal every 1.8 d and were fed with fresh prey, 72% squid and 24% fish, and a liquid fraction composed of oil and water. During short trips birds appear to rely to a great extent on Moroteuthis ingens, a squid species probably available in large numbers at the southeastern edge of the Crozet shelf. The measure of energy flows indicates that 74% of the energy delivered to the chick comes from short trips, whereas only 33.8% of the total energy is gained at sea during these trips. Males spent a greater proportion of their time foraging in short trips than females, and consequently chicks received 61.3% of their meals from males and 38.7% from females. Adult birds tended to lose mass after short trips and to lose more mass with increased duration of short trips, whereas they gained mass after long trips. They initiated long trips when their body mass was low. Although Wandering Albatrosses are able to provision their chicks at a rapid rate because of the proximity of an abundant resource, birds still have to forage far from the colony to restore their body condition. Estimates of energy yield explain this paradox, as they suggest that the rate at which prey is caught during short trips in shallow waters is half that during long trips in oceanic waters. The significance of the twofold foraging strategy in relation to food availability and foraging efficiency is discussed.

AB Components of diversity in the woody plant community were compared among three sets of sites in the Coast Ranges of Northern California: 24 small patches (0.5-3 ha) of serpentine soil, found in four sets of 5-7 patches; 24 equivalently spaced sampling sites within four large (6-55 km(2)) continuous areas of serpentine; and 24 sites on the nonserpentine soils adjacent to the small patches. On patchy compared with continuous serpentine, alpha diversity (local) was 32% lower, gamma diversity (total) was 17% higher, and beta diversity (differentiation in species composition among sites) was 72% higher. Of the increased beta diversity on patches, most (62%) occurred at the ''local'' scale of patches 50-3200 m apart, and only 10% occurred at the scale of clusters of patches 16-45 km apart. Complementarity, an alternative measure of beta diversity, showed the same patterns. Woody plants on nonserpentine soils showed diversity patterns similar to those on patchy serpentine, i.e., lower alpha and higher beta and gamma diversity relative to continuous serpentine. Nonserpentine plants showed a stronger response to environmental gradients than did serpentine plants. For the woody plant community. on serpentine soils, the natural large-scale patchiness of the habitat leads to lower local diversity but higher differentiation and regional diversity. The increased regional diversity appears to be almost entirely the result of edge effects, rather than of ''patchy coexistence'' as described by metacommunity models.

AB The oceanic eastern tropical Pacific supports a speciose seabird community that feeds in flocks and depends for food on schools of tunas and dolphins, which force prey to the surface. We analyzed data collected throughout an area of 40 x 10(6) km(2) of open ocean over 10 years (1979-1988) during 1136 at-sea days, from 1750 feeding flocks comprising 51 688 birds of 49 species. a PCA identified three distinct hock types based on species composition: ''Sooty Tern Flocks'' (n = 941 flocks) with a large number of Sooty Terns (Sterna fuscata), ''Juan-Wedge Flocks'' (n = 402 flocks) with a large number of Juan Fernandez Petrels (Pterodroma externa) and Wedge-tailed Shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus), and ''Booby Flocks'' (n = 407 flocks) with a large number of Red-footed and Masked Boobies (Sula sula and S. dactylatra, respectively). Flock types exhibited largely disjunct distributions that mirrored patterns in thermocline depth and surface water chlorophyll content. Sooty Tern Flocks occurred in areas with deepest thermocline (77.6 m) and lowest chlorophyll (0.14 mg/m(3)), Juan-Wedge Flocks in areas of intermediate thermocline (68.8 m) and chlorophyll (0.16 mg/m(3)), and Booby Flocks in areas of shallowest thermocline (62.5 m) and highest chlorophyll (0.17 mg/m(3)). These differences were statistically significant. As thermocline depth and surface water chlorophyll are reliable indicators of surface water productivity, we conclude that Sooty Tern Flocks foraged in waters of low productivity, Juan-Wedge Flocks in waters of intermediate productivity, and Booby Flocks in waters of highest productivity.
   Differences in published cost-of-flight values support the hypothesis that energetic constraint determines flock structure at the low-productivity end of the system. Sooty Terns have the lowest flight costs (4.8 W) and feed in waters of lowest productivity. Flight costs are progressively higher for those species feeding in more productive waters (9.9 W for Wedge-tailed Shearwaters, 19.0 W for Red-footed Boobies). Differences in body size support the hypothesis that interference competition determines hock structure at the high-productivity end of the system. The largest species, Masked Boobies (1987 g) and Red-footed Boobies (1003 g), feed in areas of highest productivity; progressively smaller species, Juan Fernandez Petrels (430 g) and Wedge-tailed Shearwaters (388 g), and Sooty Terns (180 g), feed in areas of decreasing productivity. We hypothesize that this community is largely structured by two factors, competition and energetic constraint, that operate at opposite ends of a productivity gradient. As productivity decreases (low prey abundance), flight proficiency is increasingly important because only species with relatively low flight costs will be able to transit between prey patches. As productivity increases (high prey abundance), competitive ability is increasingly important because competitive dominants will exclude other species from feeding flocks. Our hypothesis is in accordance with empirical data and theoretical models designed to explain factors structuring communities for a wide variety of habitats and taxa.

AB Trophic cascades are regarded as important signals for top-down control of food web dynamics. Although there is clear evidence supporting the existence of trophic cascades, the mechanisms driving this important dynamic are less clear. Trophic cascades could arise through direct population-level effects, in which predators prey on herbivores, thereby decreasing the abundance of herbivores that impact plant trophic levels. Trophic cascades could also arise through indirect behavioral-level effects, in which herbivore prey shift their foraging behavior in response to predation risk. Such behavioral shifts can result in reduced feeding time and increased starvation risk, again lowering the impact of herbivores on plants. We evaluated the relative importance of these two mechanisms, using field experiments in an old-field system composed of herbaceous plants, grasshopper herbivores, and spider predators. We created two treatments, Risk spiders that had their chelicerae glued, and Predation spiders that remained unmanipulated. We then systematically evaluated the impacts of these predator manipulations at behavioral, population, and food web scales in experimental mesocosms. At the behavioral level, grasshoppers did not distinguish between Risk spiders and Predation spiders. Grasshoppers exhibited significant shifts in feeding-time budget in the presence of spiders vs. when alone. At the grasshopper population level, Risk spider and Predation spider treatments caused the same level of grasshopper mortality, which was significantly higher than mortality in a control without spiders, indicating that the predation effects were compensatory to risk effects. At the food web level, Risk spider and Predation spider treatments decreased the impact grasshoppers had on grass biomass, supporting the existence of a trophic cascade. Moreover, Risk spider and Predation spider treatments produced statistically similar effects, again indicating that predation effects on trophic dynamics were compensatory to risk effects. We conclude that indirect effects resulting from antipredator behavior can produce trophic-level effects-that are similar in form and strength to those generated by direct predation events.

AB We report on the bird communities of a set of 12 7-yr-old forested landbridge islands in Lago Curl, a 4300 km(2) hydroelectric impoundment in the State of Bolivar, Venezuela. Birds were censused on all islands and at mainland control sites by spot mapping in 1993, and via point counts in 1995. Instead of orderly ''nested sets'' of species on landmasses of graded size, the species composition of small (approximate to 1 ha) and medium (11-12 ha) islands was highly variable. Spot mapping substantiated the occurrence of 58 species of forest-nesting birds, collectively, on the 11 small and medium islands, which supported means of only 9 and 12 resident species, respectively. No species was found on all islands, and only five species were found on as many as 7 of the 11 small and medium islands. The mean number of islands per resident species was 3.0 for the 11 islands. Transients of many species were detected on all islands, but were more frequent on near (less than or equal to 0.5 km from a larger landmass) than on far islands (greater than or equal to 1.0 km from a larger landmass). A large majority of the populations on the 1-ha islands consisted of a single pair, implying that few such populations could have survived since isolation without new colonizations to replenish individuals lost to dispersal and mortality.
   Notwithstanding low species numbers, both census methods indicated that avian densities were approximately twice as high on the 1-ha islands as on the mainland. In contrast, two of three medium-sized islands supported anomalously low densities of approximately one-fifth the mainland level. Both islands retain relict populations of capuchin monkeys (Cebus olivaceus). One hundred percent of artificial nests set out on one of these islands were raided, whereas no more than 30% of nests were lost on any of the other islands or on the mainland. For small and medium islands, we conclude that the founding communities present when the waters of Lago Curl reached their final level have already collapsed and been reconstituted. Species loss on some islands may have been accelerated by relict populations of predators, such as capuchins. Changes in composition thus appear to have been driven by a combination of biological (nest predation) and stochastic processes (high turnover).

AB Herbivores contend with spatial and temporal variation in the quality, quantity, and availability of their food resource. The energy that female moose (Alces alces) store during the summer as body fat is used to meet energy needs in winter. The foraging strategy used by an animal affects its daily and annual energy balance. Consequently, foraging strategies and the distribution of food in the landscape can affect individual fitness and population growth through their effects on the energy balance of reproductive females. Models that unify landscape structure, foraging theory, and animal energy metabolism can be used to investigate the effects of foraging strategies on survival and reproduction. We developed an energy and activity simulation environment (EASE) model that predicts the seasonal changes in energy requirements of a female moose foraging in a spatially explicit landscape with a resolution of 1 m(2). We validated EASE for both moose and deer (Odocoileus spp.) with respect to body mass changes reported for feeding trials, activity times, and browse intake rates. Energy intake and body mass depended on forage abundance, its spatial distribution, and foraging strategy. In simulations with stochasticity imposed on model parameters, mean moose body mass decreased 4 kg in comparison to simulations that were deterministic. Simulated moose body mass was most sensitive to browse digestibility and least sensitive to maximum intake per day in 1-yr simulations. Moose using nonrandom foraging strategies had higher body mass and survival than moose using random foraging strategies. Differences between strategies increased as browse density decreased. Moose that selected foraging locations with higher food density or food items with higher digestibility deposited more fat and protein than less selective moose, leading to increased survival and reproduction.

AB We investigated body temperatures of free-ranging green iguanas (Iguana iguana) on Curacao (Netherlands Antilles), and how metabolic costs and benefits of food processing affect body temperatures. Body temperatures of free-living iguanas were measured by radio telemetry. We also used a model, with activity data and operative temperature from taxidermic mounts as inputs, to estimate body temperature of free-ranging animals. Estimated body temperature was highly correlated with telemetered body temperature (mean difference 0.8 degrees C). Thus, our model for estimating lizard body temperatures may be useful in field studies where telemetry is not possible.
   Data from both telemetry and estimation with the model showed that green iguanas maintained relatively constant body temperatures (minimum 32.9 +/- 1.4 degrees C; maximum 36.6 +/- 2.9 degrees C; mean +/- 1 SD) during the midday period (0945-1545). Temperature measurements of taxidermic mounts and ambient air showed that body temperatures between 29 degrees C and 40.5 degrees C could readily be attained on Curacao. Hence, the range of potential body temperatures was much greater than the range of actually achieved body temperatures.
   Thermoregulatory behavior, food intake, and locomotor activities were recorded along with temperature measurements. Relations between body temperature, daily metabolizable energy intake (MEI), and resting metabolic rate (RMR) were used to examine whether or not observed body temperatures coincide with temperatures at which energy gain from ingested food is high. Our data show that, in these herbivorous reptiles, food intake and digestion explain most of the variation in the observed field body temperatures.

AB The main goal of this study was to evaluate sex expression at geographic and individual levels in Ochradenus baccatus, an Israeli desert shrub. Although this species was formerly thought to be strictly dioecious, in a survey of 24 Ochradenus populations along a latitudinal rainfall gradient, we found sex expression to be extremely variable. While females reproduced only by seeds, males ranged across a continuum from ''pure males'' that produced only pollen to ''inconstant males,'' which produced seeds in addition to pollen. For sexual dimorphism to evolve from cosexuality, it is believed that the sex morphs must be compensated for their loss of one sex function (e.g., pollen production) by an increase in the remaining sex function (i.e., seed production). In our study we found that females produced 9-20 times as many seeds as males, and we showed in a controlled laboratory experiment that their offspring had higher germination and seedling growth rates. Pure males invested more biomass in stamens than did inconstant males.
   Previously published models concerned with the evolution of sexual dimorphisms have predicted that: (1) the frequency of inconstant males should be inversely related to the frequency of females, and (2) if the degree of male inconstancy is influenced by environmental factors, then seed production in males should decline along with habitat quality. We found support for both of these predictions. Although the sex ratio did not differ significantly from 1:1 in 19 of the 24 populations surveyed, the frequency of male inconstancy did vary geographically. The fraction of males that produced fruit in a population declined on a north-south gradient that reflected a three-fold decline in rainfall. Among populations, the frequency of females was negatively correlated with the frequency of inconstant males. We postulate that the advantages of conditional fruit production in males (i.e., ability to produce seeds during periods of unpredictable pollinator service) will result in gynodioecy and male inconstancy remaining a stable feature of populations of O. baccatus.

AB Defoliation can affect plant competition in at least two ways. Both negative effects on the performance of defoliated plants and positive effects due to neighbor defoliation can potentially alter competitive relations between plants. Furthermore, if there is a trade-off between defense investment and growth or competitive ability, then selective herbivory may contribute to coexistence of defended and undefended plants.
   We tested these ideas in an experiment using two types of European white birch (Betula pendula). We compared growth (height) in two types that are known to differ with respect to palatability to small mammalian herbivores. The plants were grown from seeds in a greenhouse for three years and were potted either singly or in pairs. The pairs consisted either of two plants of the same type (pure pairs) or of one plant of each type (mixed pairs). In the second year, we defoliated randomly preselected plants twice. The experiment was concluded at mid-season in the third year.
   Both competition and defoliation (of the target plant) negatively affected growth. Competition reduced growth by 19-36%, the palatable type consistently being more affected than the unpalatable type. The negative effects of defoliation were about the same (9-13%) for both types. When grown singly, the palatable type grew taller (13%) than did the unpalatable type. The unpalatable type was the stronger competitor of the two types. As compared with plants grown singly, palatable plants grown in pure pairs were on average 24% shorter, while those grown in mixed pairs were 36% shorter. The corresponding data for the unpalatable type were 19% and 20%. The effects of neighbor defoliation differed between the types. The only significant effect of neighbor defoliation was that in palatable plants grown in mixed pairs neighbor defoliation compensated fully for the competitive effects, i.e., they were not significantly different from undefoliated plants grown singly. There were no significant effects of neighbor defoliation-neither on palatable plants grown in pure pairs, nor on unpalatable plants. Consequently, the effects of defoliation may not only depend on the presence of neighbors, but also on the composition of the neighborhood.

AB We studied the effects of CO2 elevation on leaf and canopy photosynthesis and optimal leaf area index (LAI) for stands of the annual species Abutilon theophrasti and Ambrosia artemisiifolia. Leaf photosynthesis was modeled as a function of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and nitrogen content per unit leaf area (N-L). There was a curvilinear relationship between the light-saturated rates of leaf photosynthesis (P-max) and N-L. CO2 elevation significantly increased P-max as a function of N, in both species. Dark respiration (R-d) was linearly correlated with N-L. CO2 elevation slightly but significantly increased R-d in Abutilon, while it had no significant effect on R-d in Ambrosia. The initial slope of a light-response curve was determined from quantum yield (phi(abs)) multiplied by leaf absorptance and then calibrated against N-L. Daily canopy photosynthesis, calculated by integration of leaf photosynthesis with the actual distribution of leaf area, leaf N, and PPFD within a canopy, showed fairly good agreement with the canopy photosynthesis estimated from growth analysis. CO2 elevation increased canopy photosynthesis by 30-50%. Based on the leaf photosynthesis model for Abutilon, we calculated daily canopy photosynthesis for a given LAI and N availability, in which N was assumed to be distributed optimally within a leaf canopy to maximize daily canopy photosynthesis. An optimal LAI to maximize daily canopy photosynthesis was obtained for each level of N availability and this optimum increased with increasing N availability. Contrary to the often predicted increase in LAI with CO2 elevation, the optimum LAI did not increase at high CO2 when N availability was limited. Two factors were suggested to be involved in counteracting the increase in LAI in a high-CO2 world. One is the higher phi(abs) of plants grown in elevated CO2, which makes leaves in the canopy more N limited, favors higher N-L and thus lowers optimal LAI. The other is the higher R-d in elevated CO2, which leads to higher light compensation points, and lowers optimal LAI.

AB Endophytic fungi and phytophagous insects derive energy from shared host plants, and so are likely to interact with one another. Several authors have proposed that fungal endophytes of woody perennials, like endophytes of grasses, have a mutualistic association with their host and provide enhanced protection from herbivory. However, there have been few tests of this hypothesis, and most studies have focused on correlating the presence of endophytes and herbivores. We investigated a system where an endophyte was known to cause significant mortality on one species of gall-forming insect (Besbicus mirabilis), but not another (Bassettia ligni) that occupies the same plant host. We predicted that gall insects should avoid high-endophyte space and that mortality would be lowest in low-endophyte space if endophytes protect plants from herbivory. We used the spatial location, temporal infection patterns, and within-leaf growth activity of the endophyte as elements of endophyte space.
   Besbicus mirabilis avoided high-endophyte space at the within-leaf scale by occupying part of the leaf where endophyte infection and endophyte-caused mortality were predictably low. However, the within-leaf position was under opposing selection pressure from mortality caused by grazing herbivores and developmental constraints, so the gall did not occupy the region of the leaf where both infection and endophyte-caused mortality were the lowest. B. ligni was spatially correlated within leaves with the presence of the endophyte but suffered almost no endophyte-caused mortality. However, B. ligni occupies the leaf lamina, where the endophyte has no growth activity, in contrast to the leaf midrib, where B. mirabilis galls are found. Further, B. ligni emerges from the gall just as endophyte infection levels reach a peak, so this species temporally avoids prolonged contact with highly infected tissue. However, the between-leaf distributions of both insects were independent of endophyte infection.
   Fungal endophytes influence the spatial patterns of insect distributions, but at different scales. Growth activity of the endophyte may also play a role, and simply examining presence/absence correlations of insects may be misleading.

AB Small fish frequently avoid large fish predators by moving into shallow refuges, but this can increase encounters with terrestrial piscivores. In previous experiments, we documented that juvenile spot (Leiostomus xanthurus) respond to southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma) by moving into shallow water. This might increase their risk of predation by birds. We conducted a pond-scale field experiment to test the hypothesis that predation by birds and flounder will have nonadditive effects on spot survival and size. We expected spot to have lower survival in the presence of both predators than expected based on their additive effects (i.e., facilitation among predators). The experiment was a 2 X 2 factorial with and without flounders and bird access. Flounder significantly reduced spot survival while birds did not, but there was a significant interaction effect. Spot survived better with both predators than expected based on adding separate predator effects. Mean spot growth rate was unaffected by treatment. Spot moved to shallow water in the presence of flounder and aggregated more tightly in the presence of birds. The observed nonadditive effects could have been due to interference between flounder and birds. However, because all the flounder in our experiments survived and their growth was unaffected by birds, we favor the idea that behavioral changes (increased aggregation) by spot to avoid bird predation also further reduced their vulnerability to flounder. Our results suggest that modeling the effects of multiple predators will be more complicated than pimply adding up the effects observed in experiments with single predators.

AB The acanthocephalan parasite Pomphorhynchus laevis is transmitted by crustaceans such as Gammarus pulex to its paratenic or final hosts, fish. The conspicuous orange-yellow parasite is visible through the transparent cuticle of G. pules. Infected gammarids are significantly less photophobic than uninfected ones. When hungry three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), one of the hosts of this parasite, were offered equal numbers of uninfected and infected prey, G. pulex infected with P. laevis were eaten significantly more often. We tested experimentally whether parasite color and parasite-induced changes in host behavior affected the predation rate of G. pulex. Color effects were tested with uninfected G. pulex by painting an orange spot on their cuticle that simulated infection. Behavioral effects were tested with infected G. pulex by covering the place through which the orange parasite was visible with inconspicuous brown paint. We showed for the first time that both parasite color and changed intermediate host behavior promote the transmission of P. laevis to its next host. The evolution of orange parasite color, and why sticklebacks do not avoid infected prey, are discussed.

AB The diversity of plant life forms in tropical forests affords the opportunity for assembly of plant combinations, both natural and managed, that make full use of resources and sustain high productivity. The influence of combining life forms on productivity and resource use was evaluated using three fast-growing tree species (Hyeronima alchorneoides, Cedrela odorata, and Cordia alliodora); each species was grown alone and with two perennial, large-stature, self-supporting monocots (Euterpe oleracea and Heliconia imbricata).
   Aboveground net primary productivity was extremely high in all stands. The monocots did not contribute significantly to the productivity of the Hyeronima polycultures, which was 4.5-8.4 g.m(-2).d(-1) between 18 and 36 mo. In contrast, the monocots accounted for 57% of the productivity (9.7 g.m(-2).d(-1)) of Cedrela polycultures and 67% of the productivity (6.8 g.m(-2).d(-1)) of the Cordia polycultures, by age 3 yr. The leaf area and density of fine roots in the Cedrela and Cordia polycultures were also significantly increased by the presence of the monocots, reaching or surpassing the levels found in the Hyeronima stands.
   The high productivity of Hyeronima, coupled with poor growth of its interplanted monocots, indicated that Hyeronima was able to achieve nearly complete use of resources. Ecosystem productivity and resource capture were increased when the monocots were grown with the other two tree species, and this occurred because of the inability of the tree species to completely utilize available resources, which provided an opportunity for the monocots to flourish in the understory. Monocot productivity in the Cedrela stands was additive to that of the trees, indicating complementary resource use between the monocots and this tree species. In the case of Cordia, tree productivity was slowed by the monocots, but this decline was more than compensated for by the high productivity of the associated monocots.
   Whether in natural forests or human-constructed agroforestry systems, the presence of dominant species that do not fully exploit all available resources allows the coexistence of other species and creates the potential for complementary resource use. The resource use characteristics of such species should be a key consideration in forest restoration efforts and in the design of sustainable land use systems.

AB Several studies have suggested the existence of a positive relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from AVHRR/NOAA satellite data and either biomass or annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) for different geographic areas and ecosystems. We calibrated a 4-yr average of the ingegral of the NDVI (NDVI-I) using spatially aggregated values of ANPP. We also provided an estimate of the energy conversion efficiency coefficient (epsilon) of Monteith's equation. This is the first attempt to calibrate a standard NDVI product for temperate perennial grasslands.
   We found a positive and statistically significant relationship between NDVI-I and ANPP for grassland areas with mean annual precipitation between 280 and 1150 mm, and mean annual temperature between 4 degrees and 20 degrees C. Depending on the method used to estimate the fraction of photosynthetic active radiation, the energy conversion officency coefficient was constant (0.24 g C/MJ), or varied across the precipitation gradient, from 0.10 g C/MJ for the least productive to 0.20 g C/MJ for the most productive sites.

AB We studied the effects of experimentally induced variation in leaf litter chemistry on leaf litter decomposition and leaf litter nutrient release of Carer species from habitats that differ in nutrient availability. Carer diandra, C. rostrata, and C. lasiocarpa are dominant in less productive mesotrophic fens, whereas C. acutiformis is dominant in more productive eutrophic fens. For each species, three types of litter were used: litter collected in the field (FLD); and litter from experimental populations grown at low (LN: 3.3 g N . m(-2). yr(-1)) and high N supply (HN: 20.0 g N . m(-2). yr(-1)). For all the litter chemistry parameters studied there were highly significant interactions between species and litter type. This implies that, due to differential plant-mediated controls on leaf litter chemistry, it is not always possible to predict changes in litter chemistry in response to increased nutrient supply.
   Litter decay was determined in a long-term (3 yr) field experiment using litter bags. The litter types of each species were incubated at their native growing sites. Contrary to what is generally found, the leaf litter decomposition rate of the species growing at the nutrient-poorest site (C. diandra) was higher than that of the species growing at the nutrient richest site (C. acutiformis). Only for C. diandra and C. lasiocarpa was the decomposition rate of the litter from the HN treatment higher than that of the field litter. Thus, increased nutrient supply does not necessarily lead to higher litter decomposition rates. Nutrient controls on litter decay changed with time: initial litter decay (less than or equal to 3 mo) was strongly controlled (high r(2) values) by all P-related litter quality parameters, whereas long-term litter decay (>1 yr) was most strongly related with the phenolics : N ratio, the phenolics : P ratio, the lignin : N ratio, and the C:N ratio. Our data suggest that high levels of atmospheric N deposition, such as in the study area (The Netherlands), may lead to a relative shortage of P in the plant-derived substrates for bacteria and fungi. As a result, P-related litter chemistry parameters exert a strong influence on litter decay.
   Our data did not support the hypothesis that high-nutrient species increase nutrient cycling due to the production of easily decomposable litter with high rates of nutrient release. The leaf litter from Carer acutiformis, the species from the high-productivity fens, decomposed more slowly than that of the other species, immobilized more N and P and had a longer period of net N and P immobilization. However, this species has a higher litter production than the other species and thereby increases the rate of nutrient cycling. At the intraspecific level, increased nutrient supply led to lower amounts of immobilized N and P and faster N and P release from litter in most species, and thereby to a higher rate of nutrient cycling. This positive feedback between nutrient supply rate and the rate of nutrient cycling is reinforced by the increase in litter production in response to increased nutrient supply.

AB The Patagonian steppe is formed by tussock grasses and shrubs in a bare-soil matrix (50% cover), and as in other arid and semiarid systems, vegetation is arranged in patches. Although there is a good understanding of the probabilities of seedling establishment of Bromus pictus in relation to location within these patches, these probabilities account for only a portion of the spatial dynamics of the community. The objective of this paper was to assess the pattern and dynamics of Bromus pictus seed availability in this community, which represent the other portion of the recruitment equation. We first evaluated its seed bank along transects. Plant- or litter-covered areas had 85% of the sampled seeds; however, they accounted for 55% of the area. Bare-soil areas had seeds only if they were located close (less than or equal to 10 cm) to a plant or litter microsite. In a second study, we analysed the movement of seeds using pitfall traps. Traps located near plants captured seed amounts similar to those from traps located in bare-ground areas (far from plants). The contrast between the high number of seeds in transit and the low number of seeds retained by bare-ground microsites illustrates the importance of lateral secondary movement of seeds. We used this information on seed distribution and previous data about establishment probabilities to estimate the spatial pattern of recruitment. Microsites that are vegetated or close to individual plants are expected to recruit the greatest number of individuals. Vegetation patches play an important role in modifying ecological processes in arid and semiarid communities. Our results highlight the importance of seed distribution in the formation and maintenance of these patches.

AB We used stable nitrogen isotopes to describe the pelagic food-web structure of three coastal Baltic Sea areas, each of which was sampled twice. Two of the areas were influenced by N-15-rich nutrient discharges from a sewage treatment plant. Analyses were made of particulate organic matter (<35 mu m, mainly phytoplankton), zooplankton, mysids (Mysis mixta and M., relicta), sprat (Sprattus sprattus), smelt (Osmerus eperlanus), four size classes of herring (Clupea harengus), and pikeperch (Stizostedion lucioperca). Discharges from the sewage treatment plant significantly increased delta(15)N values in the whole food web, from phytoplankton to piscivorous fish. Based on nitrogen isotopic compositions, consistent trophic food-web structures were observed on both occasions and in all three areas. The results indicate that zooplankton and mysids may have more complex diets than assumed before. Apparent trophic fractionation, i.e., differences in delta(15)N between a consumer and its assumed food, averaged 2.4 parts per thousand with a standard error of +/-0.5 parts per thousand. Differences between areas in fish delta(15)N show young-of-the-year herring, sprat, smelt, and pikeperch to be relatively non-migratory.

AB Plant selection, energy intake, and digestibility were studied in nonreproducing Gerbillus henleyi (10 g; n = 9), Gerbillus dasyurus (24 g; n = 6), and Meriones crassus (90 g; n = 9). These gerbils coexist in the Negev Desert Highlands, have similar dietary habits (being primarily granivores), and do not require drinking water, but they differ greatly in body mass. Each species was offered different levels (0% and similar to 40% and 80% of maintenance energy requirements) of millet seeds and ad libitum fresh vegetation consisting of Atriplex halimus, Moricandia nitens, Zygophyllum dumosum, Lycium shawii, Anabasis articulata, and Thymelaea hirsuta, the dominant plants in the area inhabited by the rodents. Drinking water was not available. We hypothesized that: (1) smaller animals would be more dependent than larger animals on highly digestible food items such as seeds, and (2) smaller animals would be more selective than larger animals for highly digestible and energy-rich plant parts.
   The minimum levels of millet seeds needed to maintain body mass were 97%, 94%, and 36% of maintenance energy requirements for G. henleyi, G. dasyurus, and M. crassus, respectively. Therefore, G. henleyi was the most dependent on seeds, and M., crassus the least, supporting hypothesis 1. At similar levels of seeds consumed, apparent digestibilities of dry matter (DMD) and energy of the total diet were highest for G. henleyi. In the absence of seeds, vegetation DMD averaged 88% in G. henleyi and 70% in M. crassus, yet G. henleyi lost body mass, as a percentage, twice as fast as M. crassus. The three rodent species were selective in consuming vegetation and made similar choices. A. halimus and M, nitens were preferred, comprising similar to 48%, 64%, and 67% of total plant dry matter consumption in G. henleyi, G. dasyurus, and M. crassus, respectively. Plant species not selected were relatively low in water and protein contents and were high;n phenolic compounds and condensed tannins compared to preferred species. Gross energy, ash, and fiber levels did not appear to affect selectivity. Selection of plant parts within each plant species, as indicated by the leaf:stem (L:S) ratio, differed among rodent species. The L:S ratio for A. halimus was 4.8, but the L:S ratios ingested were 1.7, 4.0, and 7.4 in G. henleyi, G. dasyurus, and M. crassus, respectively, indicating selection of stems by G. henleyi, selection of leaves by M. crassus, and basically no selection by G. dasyurus. The ratio of seed : green vegetation (S:G) intake was highest in G. henleyi and lowest in M. crassus. A similar inverse relationship between body mass and S:G ratio within seasons was found in other Old World and New World free-living granivorous desert rodents.

AB This paper presents the results of the first attempt to estimate and identify factors influencing individual reproductive success in a fish species, under natural conditions, after the progeny have dispersed from their site of origin. Using family-specific DNA fingerprints, the reproductive success of male smallmouth bass in Lake Opeongo, Ontario was estimated and evaluated at the point when their offspring were fall young-of-the-year (YOY). For the 1992 spring spawning season, we generated family-specific fingerprints using DNA of fry captured from 116 nests in Jones Bay. In the fall of the same year, 283 YOY were captured by electrofishing along the shoreline of the study area. Using DNA obtained from fin tissue, a fingerprint was generated for each fall YOY and compared to the family fingerprints to determine the family of origin. Males were considered successful if at least one of their offspring survived to the fall YOY stage. Although 27.7% of all males who acquired eggs (N = 57) had at least one offspring Surviving to the fall YOY stage, only 5.4% of all spawning males (N = 11) produced 54.7% of the total number of fall YOY captured. If recruitment frequently depends on the success of such a small number of males, then population abundance will be extremely vulnerable to adverse natural and anthropogenic impacts. Because natural resource managers cannot differentiate these few successful males a priori, they cannot differentially protect them from potentially adverse human activities? such as opening the fishing season on a preset date that may fall before the end of brood-guarding in a given year.
   The evaluation of variables that might influence differences in male reproductive success included male length and age, spawning date, number of eggs and fry within a nest, nest depth, and dominant substrate type both within and surrounding the nest. Logistic regression analysis indicated that none of these variables were significant predictors of male reproductive success (P > 0.05). Additionally, linear regression analysis suggested the lack of a relationship between the number of fall YOY produced per male and these variables. However, a goodness-of-fit test to the Poisson distribution indicated that the number of YOY produced per male does not occur at random (P < 0.001), suggesting that reproductive success was influenced by factors not measured in this study.

AB Tree invasion of old fields is an important process affecting landscape heterogeneity and species diversity, as well as the quality of wildlife habitat, in eastern North America. We examined the effects of tree seed and seedling predation by small mammals on the rate, spatial pattern, and species composition of tree invasion in old fields. We performed field experiments inside U-shaped enclosures built at forest-field edges, within which we manipulated the density of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus), which are major seedling predators. Although we did not directly manipulate density of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), which are major seed predators, mouse density was high wherever vole density was low. We introduced cohorts of seeds and seedlings of red maple (Acer rubrum) or sugar maple (Acer saccharum) [as specified in the Methods for each trial], white ash (Fraxinus americana), white pine (Pinus strobus), and tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima), all common early invaders of old fields in our study area. Rates of seedling predation were higher in enclosures with higher density of voles, and voles showed distinct preferences for red maple, white ash, and Ailanthus over white pine. Predation rates on small seedlings were higher than on larger seedlings. Seedlings near the forest edge were killed at a lower rate than those >5 m into the field. Predation rates on seeds were higher in low-vole-density treatments, where mice were more abundant. Mice showed distinct preferences for white pine, avoided Ailanthus, and consumed sugar maple and white ash at intermediate rates. Predation rates on seeds were higher in shrub-dominated than in herbaceous old fields. Overall density of mice increased dramatically between 1994 and 1995, and seed predation rates increased concomitantly. In 1994, seed predation was most intense 5 m and 10 m into the field, and less intense at the forest-field edge and 20 m into the field; although a similar pattern was observed in 1995, the Variation was not statistically significant. We conclude that both of these common small mammal species can have profound effects on survival of tree propagules near forest-field edges, but that their effects are strongly dependent on density. Voles had a strong, negative direct effect on seedling survival, but a positive indirect effect on seed survival by inhibiting seed predation by mice. Voles and mice: (1) showed distinctly different food preferences; (2) had their strongest effects at different positions with respect to the forest-field edge; and (3) had their strongest effects in different old-field types (herbaceous fields for voles, shrub-dominated fields for mice). These two species are not functionally redundant in their effects on old-field succession.

AB We tested the hypothesis that food supplementation for the generalist arthropod predator Tenodera sinensis would alleviate starvation and reduce intraguild predation. Two field experiments showed that mantids had higher growth rates and lower dispersal in the presence of supplemental prey. However, estimated mortality was greater in food-addition plots, so that numbers of mantid nymphs remaining at the end of the experiments were not significantly different from those in control plots. When groups of mantids were raised in the laboratory, mortality declined with increased food, owing to decreased starvation. Cannibalism in these cohorts did not differ between food levels. Therefore, greater mortality at higher food levels probably was not caused by intraspecific interactions. Emigration of cursorial spiders large enough to prey on mantids decreased in the food-addition plots and may have increased intraguild predation on mantids. In any case, elevating prey level apparently does not predictably benefit food-limited generalist predators.

AB DNA-based methods of determining parentage in birds have revealed that apparent reproductive success can be very different from true reproductive success. Our main goal in this study was to provide estimates of true annual and lifetime reproductive success of male Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) to determine the importance of extra-pair mating to reproductive success. Males that were more successful at extra-pair mating, both annually and over their lifetimes, were also more successful on their own territories, so extra-pair success was not achieved at the expense of within-pair success. Relative to within-pair success, extra-pair success accounted for only one-fifth as much variance in total success (annual and lifetime). For some individuals, however, extra-pair success was a substantial part of their total success. Standardized variance in true annual success was 16% higher overall than the variance in apparent success, although the effect was inconsistent from year to year. Standardized variance in lifetime success increased 39% due to extra-pair paternity. Thus, extra-pair mating modestly increased the opportunity for sexual selection. Males with the highest annual success on their own territories mated with more females on their territories, had fewer of those females mating with other males, and lost fewer nests to predation. Annual extra-pair success was highly correlated with the number of extra-pair mates. The number of years a male bred and the number of females with which he mated contributed significantly to the variance in lifetime success, both within pairs and extra-pair. Reproductive success in the first breeding season was significantly positively correlated with lifetime success. Positive correlations between true and apparent reproductive success and between true mating success and harem size suggest that conventional (i.e., nongenetic) estimates of success provide reasonable estimates of population patterns, despite being unreliable for estimating individual success. Many of the ecological factors that affected lifetime success (e.g., territory acquisition, longevity) of males and females appeared similar between our Canadian population and a population in Washington state, USA. However, variance in male success appears to be much higher in Washington, suggesting that exploiting this geographical variation might be a productive way to study sexual selection in this species.

AB The factors that contribute to species establishment and decline determine the rate and pattern of successional change. We tested a commonly held assumption that competitive displacement is responsible for the loss of species during succession. Manipulative field experiments were used to examine the effects of interspecific competition on the population dynamics of Senecio sylvaticus, a winter annual that briefly dominates postharvest sites in the western Cascade Range of Oregon. Senecio increased in density 400-fold from the first to the second growing season after disturbance but decreased precipitously in year 3 to 10% of the density and 0.5% of the biomass per plot of the previous year. Although interspecific competition reduced the cover and biomass of Senecio during its peak year, it had little or no effect on either the population increase or decline; the pattern of change was similar among all treatments. These counterintuitive results underscore the importance of testing, not simply assuming, that interspecific competition is responsible for the replacement of a species during succession.

AB The chlorophyll-to-phaeophytin (D665/D665a) ratio is an index of physiological stress in aquatic bryophytes. In the present study, the usefulness of this index for evaluating water contamination was investigated. Samples of bryophytes and water were collected from 188 stretches of river in northwest Spain. Water quality was characterized by standard procedures. Ecological profile methods were used to investigate (for each species and each water quality variable) whether stress index or frequency of occurrence varied significantly along environmental gradients. Most stress profiles showed significant departures from uniformity, whereas many frequency profiles did not, indicating that the stress index approach is more sensitive to differences in water quality than are approaches based simply on presence/absence data. To further investigate relationships between water quality variables and D665/D665a ratio, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used. The first axis extracted by CCA was clearly closely related to degree of organic pollution. The second axis was most strongly correlated with pH. Taken together, these results suggest that D665/D665a ratio in aquatic bryophytes may be of value as an indicator of river water pollution.

AB The phytoplankton community of eutrophic shallow lakes is often dominated by filamentous cyanobacteria of the family Oscillatoriaceae. In this paper we follow two independent approaches to show that this situation is likely to be one of two alternative stable states of the algal community. First we analyze patterns of cyanobacterial dominance observed in the field, and show that these patterns imply that the algal community is a hysteretic system with two alternative equilibria. Then, we construct a simple competition model to show that hysteresis should in fact be expected from differences in physiology between cyanobacteria and algae. The basic mechanism is that cyanobacteria are the superior competitors under conditions of low light, but also promote such conditions, as they can cause a higher turbidity per unit of phosphorus than other algae. This mechanism of hysteresis offers an explanation for the resistance of cyanobacteria dominance in shallow lakes to restoration efforts by means of nutrient reduction.

AB The ability of small-scale experiments to predict dynamics and patterns observed at larger scales is an important issue in ecology. In this paper, we describe responses of benthic, trout stream communities to replicated, whole-ecosystem perturbations resulting from pathogen-induced reductions in populations of a dominant grazer the caddisfly Glossosoma nigrior. Previous small-scale experiments suggested that Glossosoma had strong competitive effects on other grazers (through exploitation) and small-bodied filter-feeders (through interference). Glossosoma populations collapsed in a number of Michigan trout streams since the late 1980s and have been maintained at low levels by recurrent pathogen outbreaks. Here we address the effects on periphyton, grazers, and filter-feeders of parasite-induced Glossosoma reductions in six streams for which considerable pre-and post-collapse data are available, and we compare the results of this large-scale perturbation to responses predicted from a small-scale experiment that had been previously conducted in one of these streams. Periphyton and most grazers and filter-feeders showed marked increases in abundance following reduction in Glossosoma populations. Several grazers that were rare or absent prior to Glossosoma collapse have established sizable populations, suggesting that they had been excluded by competition with Glossosoma. The small-scale experiment successfully predicted the direction of response of most taxa to whole-stream reductions in Glossosoma abundance, but it tended to underestimate the extent and magnitude of Glossosoma's effects in the community. In these systems, observations at larger spatial and temporal scales have been essential to developing a clearer understanding of the mechanisms structuring communities.

AB Biochemical pathways that produce floral pigments often also produce secondary compounds that are believed to protect plants from natural enemies. Mutations that affect floral pigment patterns are thus also expected to influence the production of compounds conferring resistance to natural enemies, suggesting that the evolution of floral pigment patterns may be guided not just by interactions with pollinators, but also by indirect selection exerted by enemies on resistance. In particular, mutations that block production of floral pigments may be expected either to block production of defensive compounds or, alternatively, to lead to increased production of defenses, depending on the position of the blockage in the pathway. This expectation was examined in the morning glory Ipomoea purpurea by assessing whether white-flowered genotypes are more or less susceptible to attack by natural enemies than pigmented genotypes. No such difference in susceptibility was detected, although resistance to capsule-feeding insects exhibited a pigment genotype X background genotype interaction. While this negative result indicates that natural enemies probably do not influence the evolution of floral pigment pattern in I. purpurea, this remains a possibility in other systems.

AB Inter- and intrastrain competitive interactions and their effects on fitness were quantified for coexisting strains of Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici (Pst) on wheat leaves. Urediniospores of two strains were inoculated onto leaves singly and in a 1:1 mixture over a range of inoculum densities. Per-leaf relationships among inoculum density, uredinial formation, and urediniospore production were quanitified and mathematically modeled. From the single-strain data, values of carrying capacity for uredinia on leaves, infection efficiency of urediniospores, maximum sporulation capacity on leaves, and sporulation efficiency of uredinia were estimated for both strains. From the mixed-strain data, interstrain competitive effects of each strain on the other's uredinial formation and urediniospore production were evaluated. Although one strain had competitive advantages in both uredinial formation and urediniospore production, the other strain was able to dominate in mixture due to its substantially higher carrying capacity, maximum sporulation capacity, and infection efficiency. This illustrates that in coexisting strains or species, competitive advantages do not necessarily translate into an advantage in fitness. The methods of competition analysis have potential applications for the study of pathogen populations, as well as other systems of coexisting organisms.

AB This study examines the influence of fire-induced deforestation in well-drained conifer sites on the development of adjacent, surviving spruce stands in peatlands at the arctic tree line (northern Quebec). Tree-ring and growth-form patterns of cross-dated black spruce (Picea mariana) remains in peat were used to analyze stand responses in two contrasting topographical settings: a moderately protected valley-bottom peatland, and an exposed hilltop peatland. Dense, old-growth spruce populations occupied the studied peatlands between the 11th and 16th centuries, with stunted and erect spruce dominating the hilltop and the valley sites, respectively. Spruce continued to colonize the peatlands as long as the adjacent well-drained sites were occupied by forest trees able to attenuate the damaging effect of winter snow-drifting conditions. The surviving conifer stands exhibited similar growth responses following deforestation of the well-drained sites by wildfire in AD 1567-1568. These responses included dieback of supranival (above snow) stems and death of trees due to drowning in permafrost-induced ponds. The postfire degradation and disappearance of the conifer stands from the peatlands were the ultimate stage of a positive feedback process triggered by a modification of the snow regime at the landscape scale. Deforestation of the well-drained sites led to reduced snow accumulation and enhanced snow-drift exposure, thus inducing permafrost aggradation and drainage impediment in the nearby peatland sites. While the hilltop conifer stand responded immediately to forest exclusion in the nearby sites, ecosystem changes in the valley peatland were delayed until AD 1580-1590, at the beginning of the Little Ice Age. Our results emphasize the sensitivity and connectedness of adjoining ecosystems to fire and frost disturbances in a changing subarctic landscape mosaic.

AB We analyzed the productivity of C-3 and C-4 grasses throughout the Great Plains of the United States in relation to three environmental factors: mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, and soil texture. Productivity data were collected from Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) rangeland survey data. Climate data were interpolated from weather stations throughout the region. Soil texture data were obtained from NRCS State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) databases. A geographic information system was used to integrate the three data sources. With a data set of spatially random points, we performed stepwise multiple regression analyses to derive models of the relative and absolute production of C-3 and C-4 grasses in terms of mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), percentage sand (SAND), and percentage clay (CLAY).
   MAT, MAP, and soil texture explained 67-81% of the variation in relative and absolute production of C-3 and C-4 grasses. Both measures of production of C-3 grasses were negatively related to MAT and SAND, and positively related to CLAY. Relative production of C-3 grasses decreased whereas absolute production of C-3 grasses increased with MAP. Production of C-4 grasses was positively related to MAT, MAP, and SAND, and negatively related to CLAY. MAP was the most explanatory variable in the model for C-4 absolute production. MAT was the most explanatory variable in the three ether models.
   Based on these regression models, C-3 grasses dominate 35% of the Great Plains under current climatic conditions, mainly north of Colorado and Nebraska. Under a 2 degrees C increase in MAT, C-3 grasses recede northward and retain dominance in only 19% of the region. MAT, MAP, and soil texture are important variables in explaining the abundance and distribution of C-3 and C-4 grasses in the Great Plains. Accordingly, these variables will be important under changing CO2 and climatic forcings.

   POPULATION; ENERGETICS; RESPONSES
AB Environmental stress reduces the fitness of organisms, and in this manner may shape species distribution and evolutionary change. Ecologists have long been interested in physiological mechanisms that reduce the effects of stress and result in improved fitness. It has previously been suggested (1) that selection for stress resistance will bring about the evolution of lower standard metabolic rates and (2) that organisms with increased stress resistance will have a lower metabolic rate during stressful conditions, compared to stress-sensitive organisms. We have tested these hypotheses using replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster. Desiccation and starvation-selected populations and their controls, as well as populations selected for postponed senescence and their short-generation controls were examined. The metabolic rate of each selected and control population was measured under three different environmental conditions: (1) desiccation (no food or water), (2) starvation (water present, no food), and (3) food condition (food and water present). The carbohydrate and lipid content of each population were also measured. All selected and control populations lowered their metabolic rates when measured under starving conditions compared to food conditions. The metabolic rates of flies under desiccating conditions did not differ from food conditions regardless of selection treatment. When comparing the mass-specific metabolic rates of stress-selected populations to their controls, stress-selected populations had a significantly lower mass-specific metabolic rate in all cases, regardless of the environmental conditions under which the measurements were made. However, once the mass of nonmetabolizing lipid and carbohydrate was accounted for and metabolic rate was expressed in carbohydrate-lipid free mass, selected populations did not differ significantly in metabolic rate from control populations, regardless of the environmental condition under which the measurements were made. We conclude that in the case of D. melanogaster, resistance to stress does not require the evolution of a lower metabolic rate. Instead, the accumulation of metabolic resources such as carbohydrate and lipid may be important for resistance to specific forms of stress.

ID IPSATIVE MEASURES
AB Ecologists are often restricted to using or choose to use proportional- or percentage-type data with the view that it helps standardize for differences in variable totals among sampling units or individuals. This standardization to compositional data leads to constraints in the covariance and correlation structure that profoundly affect subsequent analysis and interpretation. This is another form of the problem related to the use of ratios in statistical analyses. Using simulated and zooplankton data I demonstrate the effect of using compositional data vs. the original data in correlation, ordination, and cluster analysis, which are common analytical methods in community ecology. Interpretations about the relatedness of various taxa or sites may reverse when using compositions relative to the unstandardized data. In addition, the selection of subcompositions (i.e., one or more variables are excluded when calculating the composition) may have profound and unpredictable consequences for the results. I examine some approaches proposed to deal with such data, e.g., centered log-ratio analysis, and recommend the use of correspondence analysis in multivariate studies to avoid the problems associated with differing solutions.

AB The present study addresses responses of a pasture community to CO2 enrichment in situ. It focused on two levels of organization. We examined changes in both community properties and species-specific responses during long-term exposure to high CO2 concentration. The underlying hypothesis is that CO2 enrichment could change community composition. At the community level, we observed higher species richness and lesser dominance under enriched than ambient CO2. Two species were apparently central in explaining our results, Agropyron repens and Plantago major. The cover of this first species increased only under ambient CO2. Conversely, the cover of the latter species decreased under ambient CO2 but remained stable under enriched CO2. Species were pooled into dicots and monocots to examine space acquisition. Changes in monocot cover through time were more tightly coupled with that of dicots under ambient than high CO2. Enrichment with CO2 appeared to have a positive effect on the early-successional species, preventing the complete dominance by late-successional species. In fact, under elevated CO2 early- and late-successional species were coexisting. Therefore, our results suggest the possibility that succession patterns might be altered by CO2 enrichment apparently because enriched CO2 stimulates the growth of dicots.

AB In tallgrass prairie, periodic spring fires often result in enhanced aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) that exceeds the productivity of either annually burned or unburned sites. This study evaluated two alternate hypotheses for the ''pulse'' in productivity following an infrequent fire: (1) enhanced ANPP results from increased net N mineralization rates due to the removal of surface litter and elevated soil temperatures following fire (the enhanced mineralization hypothesis) or (2) enhanced ANPP results from a transient release from both light and N limitation during a nonequilibrium period as a switch from a transient release from both light and N limitation during a nonequilibrium period as a switch from energy to N limitation occurs (the transient maxima hypothesis). The former hypothesis predicts greater N availability following an infrequent fire, relative to either annually burned or unburned prairie. The latter predicts that N availability following an infrequent fire will decline to intermediate levels, relative to unburned and annually burned prairie, and continue to decline with successive annual fires.
   To test these hypotheses, I measured inorganic soil N, net N mineralization rates, and plant productivity and N content at Konza Prairie in sites with several different burn histories (unburned, annually burned, infrequently burned). Inorganic soil N and cumulative net N mineralization rates were greatest on the unburned sites, lowest in annually burned sites, and intermediate in infrequently burned sites. Net N mineralization rates and plant tissue N content both declined with successive spring burning. These results did not support the enhanced mineralization hypothesis but indicated that enhanced ANPP following an infrequent fire resulted from an accumulation of inorganic and mineralizable N in the absence of fire which, under conditions of adequate light availability, was utilized following a spring fire. This is consistent with the transient maxima hypothesis and suggests that nonequilibrium responses to multiple, variable resources (light, energy, N) are an important aspect of tallgrass prairie ecosystem dynamics.

AB This study examines behavioral and physiological responses of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) adopting alternative life history patterns following a period of reduced growth. We manipulated the growth rates of premigratory and nonmigratory salmon by either reducing food availability or maintaining water at low temperature (4-6 degrees C). A third group of fish was kept at ambient temperatures (12-14 degrees C) and fed ad libitum to provide a control. Fish in both experimental groups exhibited compensatory growth after the manipulation period, even though the manipulations had slowed growth rather than caused mass loss. The timing and duration of compensatory growth were affected by the nature of the constraint and the developmental pathway adopted. Compensatory responses were more persistent and stronger among premigratory fish than among nonmigratory. Fish kept at low temperature did not accelerate growth immediately after transfer to ambient temperatures, but they subsequently grew faster than controls for up to 215 d after the end of the manipulation period. This mitigated the effects of the period of low temperatures, although by the end of the experiment they were still smaller than the controls. Fish on reduced rations showed no such time lag, and they grew significantly faster than controls immediately upon regaining access to full rations. These fish attained the same body size as controls by the end of the experiment (day 215). The manipulations caused fish to reduce their growth in mass more than their rate of skeletal growth, but all fish achieved ''normal'' mass for their length (as compared to controls) within a week of transfer to full feeding or ambient temperature. The main mechanism underlying compensatory growth rates was apparently the increase of intake rates, although this was insufficient to explain the strong compensation shown by temperature-manipulated fish in the presence of larger (and thus competitively superior) individuals. Instead these fish enhanced their growth rate by apparently increasing the duration of the daily feeding period, and avoiding aggressive interactions. We interpret the observed compensation for periods of slowed growth as indicating that growth rate is normally submaximal and can be increased if the animal has fallen below its expected trajectory; thus premigratory fish may have shown a greater compensation because survival rates during migration are strongly size-dependent.

AB Laboratory studies have shown that incubation environments can affect morphological and behavioral phenotypes of hatchling lizards, but the relevance of this result to natural populations remains unclear. We monitored thermal regimes during the incubation period in 19 natural nests of scincid lizards (Bassiana duperreyi) in montane southeastern Australia, and experimentally translocated eggs among nests to remove the confounding of ''nest of origin'' (including genetic) factors with incubation conditions. We removed the eggs from the field shortly before hatching, and assessed the hatchlings' phenotypes (body size, shape, locomotor performance). Most of the effects seen after laboratory incubation were also seen after incubation in natural nests. Hatchling phenotypes were affected by incubation conditions as well as by ''nest of origin'' factors and an interaction between the two. Both the mean and the variance of incubation temperatures affected hatchling phenotypes, with male and female hatchlings differing in their norms of reaction. We found no evidence that a female's choice of nest site depends on the specific norms of reaction of her own offspring. Overall, incubation temperatures induced approximately half as much variance in hatchling phenotypes as did ''nest-of-origin'' effects. We conclude that incubation-induced phenotypic plasticity in hatchling reptiles may be important in the natural environment, as well as in the laboratory.

AB Variations of intrinsic water-use efficiency during the last century were investigated based on analysis of delta(13)C in tree rings of Abies alba from the Jura Mountains (eastern France). To separate the effects related to the age of the tree at the time the tree ring was formed from effects due to environmental changes, analyzed wood samples were extracted from a very large sample set including different tree ages and calendar dates of wood formation.
   For the first 75 yr of the life of Abies alba, delta(13)C of wood holocellulose increases with the age of the tree from -24.4 parts per thousand at age 15 to approximately -22.5 parts per thousand at age 75. Between the ages of 75 and 150 values remain constant at -22.5 parts per thousand. Consequently, the effect of the tree age on isotopic discrimination has to be taken into account in studies on the long-term environmental effects on delta(13)C in tree rings.
   Divergent trends of delta(13)C during the last century were observed between tree rings formed at age 40 and bulk air data. The isotopic discrimination Delta varied insignificantly around a mean of 17.3 parts per thousand between the 1860s and the 1930s. It then decreased to 15.8 parts per thousand from the 1930s to the 1980s. Using these results and classical models of carbon discrimination, we calculated that the intrinsic water-use efficiency (A/g(w), the ratio of CO2 assimilation rate to stomatal conductance for water vapor), integrated over the year, has increased by 30% between the 1930s and the 1980s. These results, obtained at the level of mature trees, are consistent with the physiological effects of increasing CO2 concentrations as observed in controlled experiments on young seedlings. They are consistent with the strong increases in radial growth observed for Abies alba in western Europe over the past decades. However, other long-term environmental changes such as increasing nitrogen deposition could cause similar effects.

AB Models of protandry (1) assume implicitly or explicitly that independent evolution of male and female preadult development times is possible and (2) assume or assert that protandry should increase in populations that are univoltine or at least composed of discrete, nonoverlapping generations. Herein we examine these assumptions in the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii. Heritability and additive generic variance of development time are higher in female than in male W. smithii. Protandry is higher in lines selected for slow development than in lines selected for fast development or in unselected control lines. Protandry is therefore capable of evolving. Contrary to predictions based on sexual selection, southern populations with multiple, overlapping generations are just as protandrous as northern bi- and univoltine populations with discrete generations. Voltinism and developmental synchrony of the population do not appear to have been major selective factors in the evolution of protandry in W. smithii. We propose that protandry can be maintained by natural selection in multivoltine populations with overlapping generations as a consequence of sexually dimorphic fitness criteria. Selection should minimize development time in males but maximize growth rate in females. In W. smithii, females achieve higher growth rate than males but also harbor greater genetic variation for development time, indicating that selection has, indeed, minimized development time to a greater extent in males than in females. We conclude that if both natural and sexual selection are involved in the maintenance of protandry in populations of W. smithii, then their relative importance changes with the degree of generation overlap.

AB Previous tests for aggregation of organisms among sampling units that vary in size and tests for size-based sample-unit selection fail to account for variation in the size of the sample unit. When sample units vary in size, tests that assume equal-sized sample units overestimate the degree of aggregation and have a tendency to find selection for large-sized sample units. Previous tests for selection of large or small leaves by phytophagous insects have been biased toward detecting selection for large leaves when no leaf selection or selection for small leaves may actually be present, and toward detecting aggregation even when populations are Poisson random or repulsed. We derive explicitly the population mean and variance of the number of organisms per sample unit when the size of the sample unit is random, and we outline procedures to estimate the degree of aggregation and test for size-based sample-unit selection using a generalized linear model based on a Poisson null hypothesis of independent random placement.

AB Current models of parasite-host interactions generally emphasize considerations of parasite virulence and parasite transmission rather than host responses to attack. We describe a situation in which parasitism causes a host to change its feeding behavior and this change improves the expected fitness of the host and probably the fitness of its parasites. We have found that a tachinid parasitoid (Thelaira americana) often emerges from its caterpillar host (Platyprepia virginalis) without killing the host. Whether the host caterpillar survives its parasites depends in part on what it has been eating. Unparasitized caterpillars were more likely to survive to adulthood when feeding on lupine, whereas parasitized caterpillars were more likely to survive on poison hemlock. Development time and pupal masses of caterpillars (both parasitized and unparasitized) were not found to be affected by the host plants that they fed on. Survival of fly larvae in caterpillars that we determined were parasitized using ultrasound was not affected by host plant. However, fly pupae that emerged from caterpillars that had been reared on hemlock were heavier than those emerging from lupine-fed caterpillars. This was due primarily to the direct effect of diet on the flies and less so to the indirect benefit to flies whose host caterpillars survived their parasites by feeding on hemlock.
   Parasitized caterpillars were more likely to select hemlock, and unparasitized caterpillars were more likely to select lupine when offered both host plants in field tests. These results were consistent for the two years that the choice experiments were conducted. These results were also consistent with the hypothesis that caterpillars change their food plant choices so as to increase their conditional success.
   Conditional food choices that increase success depending upon parasite load are well accepted for humans, controversial for other primates, and unknown for insects. If caterpillars alter their host plant choices as a result of their parasite load, then this phenomenon could help to explain the evolution of host plant choices that have defied explanation in the past. Such a suggestion assumes that nonlethal parasitism is a common phenomenon. We believe that this may be the case since we did not detect the nonlethal nature of this interaction until we began the unconventional practice of rearing in the field. Other workers have described nonlethal parasitism for several tachinid-host systems, and many families of flies are similar to tachinids except that their hosts are vertebrates; these interactions are nonlethal. Future empirical work, as well as models of parasite-host interactions, should consider the possibility that hosts alter their plant choices depending upon their parasite loads.

AB Plant species composition, species abundances, and species richness were strongly recruitment limited in a 4-yr experiment in which seeds of up to 54 species were added to patches of native grassland. Four field seasons after a one-time addition of seed, many added species were still present and reproducing, with plots seeded at the highest rate having species richness that was 83% greater and total plant cover that was 31% greater than controls. Total plant community cover increased significantly with the number of species added as seed, but total cover of pre-existing species was independent of the number of species added as seed, suggesting that the new species mainly filled previously ''empty'' sites.
   The proportion of added species that became established was negatively correlated with initial species richness of plots, suggesting that species-rich sites were more resistant to invasion. Plot invasibility also depended on the abundances and species richness of plant functional groups in the plots, but was independent of seed size and of total plant cover. The major functional groups of plants differed in their abilities to invade as seed, with perennial grasses being the poorest invaders and herbaceous legumes being the best. Thus, local biotic interactions and recruitment dynamics jointly determined diversity, species composition, and species abundances in these native grassland communities. This supports a metapopulation-like perspective over a purely interspecific-interaction perspective or a purely regional perspective, suggesting that recruitment limitation may be more important, even on a local scale, than often recognized.

AB We tested the hypothesis that an omnivorous land crab determines the dynamics of seedling recruitment in rain forest on Christmas Island, Indian Ocean. The red crab (Gecarcoidea natalis) occurs at densities of similar to 1 crab/m(2) and consumes seeds, seedlings, and leaf litter. A crab-exclusion experiment below closed canopy and in light gaps showed that red crabs markedly reduced seedling recruitment. Overall, seedling emergence was 29-fold and 21-fold greater on the exclusion plots in the understory and in gaps, respectively. In control plots, mean seedling densities never exceeded 15 seedlings/25 m(2) in the understory and 3 seedlings/25 m(2) in gaps. Species richness of seedlings was significantly higher in the absence of crabs, averaging >10 and 12 species per plot in the understory and gaps, respectively. On control plots, mean species richness was less than one species per plot. Two-dimensional ordination (using nonmetric multidimensional scaling) showed that red crabs had a large impact on relative species abundances. Analyses of similarity confirmed that significant differences existed between both treatments and habitats. Seed removal and seedling transplant experiments suggested that most rain forest species are rapidly eaten by red crabs. Seedlings of many of these vulnerable species (e.g., Maclura cochinchinensis, Planchonella nitida, Schefflera elliptica) were abundant on exclusion plots. However, they were rare on control plots, and none persisted for >2 mo. Persistent seedlings were limited to two species (Inocarpus fagifer and Tristiropsis acutangula), both of which were resistant as seeds and seedlings to crab predation. Although red crabs are the major biotic determinants of seedling recruitment, this impact was not reflected in the overhead canopy. Some tree species unable to recruit in the presence of crabs were common as adults. Shifting mosaics in crab densities over space and time may offer the best explanation for recruitment of vulnerable species. Our results show that a dominant consumer has large effects on plant community structure on a remote oceanic island, consistent with the viewpoint that strong control by a single species is more likely in simple communities.

AB Leaf phenology was monitored for 49 woody species (trees and tall shrubs) each month over a 2.5-year period in a humid, wet-dry tropical eucalypt savanna at Solar Village, near Darwin, Australia. In the 10 most common species, which spanned the range of phenological types, phenology was monitored every two weeks. To investigate the relationships between leaf phenology and plant water status, pre-dawn leaf water potential was monitored in eight common species every 4-6 weeks, Four main phenological types were described: (1) evergreen species, which retained full canopy throughout the year; (2) brevi- or partly deciduous species, in which the amount of canopy fell significantly, but briefly, during at least one dry season during the study period, but to levels not below 50% of full canopy; (3) semideciduous species in which canopy fell to below 50% of full canopy in each of the dry seasons; and (4) fully deciduous species, which lost all leaves during the early-mid dry season, and remained leafless for at least one month. Of these 49 species, 24% were evergreen, 20% were brevideciduous, 29% were semideciduous, and 27% were fully deciduous. Leaf fall occurred 1-2 months earlier in the dry season for the fully deciduous species than for the semideciduous species. Leaf fall in all species was coincident with the attainment of seasonal minima in leaf water potential, which were, on average, about -1.5 to -2.0 MPa in the evergreen and semideciduous species, compared with about -0.5 to -1.0 MPa in the fully deciduous species. Leaf flushing occurred throughout the dry season in the two evergreen species, with a major peak in the late dry season. In five semideciduous species and one of the fully deciduous species, leaf flushing commenced in the late dry season prior to the occurrence of any rain. In two fully deciduous species, leaf flushing occurred only after the first storms of the early wet season. There was variation in the timing of flushing, both between species within years and between years for some species. However, all species commenced leaf flushing after water potentials rose, following the attainment of seasonal minima in pre-dawn leaf water potential. Soil moisture at 1 m did not fall below permanent wilting point during the dry season; hence, reserves of soil water at the end of the dry season were sufficient to support the whole-plant rehydration that preceded leaf flushing in the absence of rain. These results are consistent with hypotheses, developed in the neotropics, that leaf phenology in trees from the wet-dry tropics is largely controlled by endogenous mechanisms.

AB Tree ring and growth form sequences of 319 black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] BSP.) stems buried in a treeless peatland at the arctic tree line of northern Quebec were used to reconstruct the development of a woodland in response to climate change and fires during the last 2500 years. A high frequency of diagnostic tree rings (light rings and narrow rings) allowed the cross-dating of 142 individuals and the construction of a master chronology spanning AD 690-1591. Three floating chronologies covering 964 (approximate to 178 BC-AD 785), 349 (approximate to 587-239 BC) and 210 (approximate to 1274-1065 BC) years were also developed. The buried stems were classified as arborescent (75%), small fragments of unknown origin (13%), stumps (11%), and portions of stunted stems (1%). The high frequency of arborescent individuals indicates that the buried spruces were the remains of a former forest. The forest bordered the peatland between 600 BC and AD 1568, and successfully regenerated after two fires around 350 BC and 10 BC. Winter-damaged trees dominated during periods of suppressed growth at AD 760-860 and AD 1025-1400, whereas undamaged trees were more frequent during periods of rapid growth around AD 700-750, 860-1000, 1400-1450, and 1500-1570. Fast growth between AD 860-1000, along with the concurrent establishment of symmetrical trees, suggests well-defined boundaries for the Medieval Warm Period in northeastern Canada. The forest abruptly shifted to an open krummholz (stunted spruce) after the last fire in AD 1568, indicating that a climatic threshold inhibiting postfire regeneration was crossed between the second and the last fires. The maintenance of this old growth forest over 1500 yr, in the absence of external disturbances except climate change, was probably due to the buffering effect of aggregated trees on wind-drifted conditions at the snowpack line. With the exclusion of the forest influence on microclimate and local growth conditions, the AD 1568 fire caused the forest vegetation to shift to krummholz. The amplitude of these ecosystem changes at tree line does not mirror that of climate change. Hence, it is concluded that climate and vegetation reconstructions from proxy indicators cannot portray full ecological impact, because vegetation change at tree line is nonlinear relative to climate change.

AB The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution suggests that reciprocal evolution involves three processes that operate among populations: selection mosaics, coevolutionary hotspots, and trait remixing. These processes, in turn, produce three patterns: population differences in traits favored by an interaction, a combination of trait matches and mismatches among populations, and few species-level coevolved traits (i.e., coevolved traits that have spread to all populations). Here I show how studies of the interactions between the pollinating floral parasite Greya politella and its host plants provide evidence for most of the components of this view of the coevolutionary process, including indications of the ecological conditions that can prevent coevolutionary change. These studies are suggesting that the dynamics of coevolution in these interactions are interpretable only when analyzed over broad geographic scales.

AB Meta-analysis is a statistical technique that allows one to combine the results from multiple studies to glean inferences on the overall importance of various phenomena. This method can prove to be more informative than common ''vote counting,'' in which the number of significant results is compared to the number with nonsignificant results to determine whether the phenomenon of interest is globally important. While the use of metaanalysis is widespread in medicine and the social sciences, only recently has it been applied to ecological questions. We compared the results of parametric confidence limits and homogeneity statistics commonly obtained through meta-analysis to those obtained from resampling methods to ascertain the robustness of standard meta-analytic techniques. We found that confidence limits based on bootstrapping methods were wider than standard confidence limits, implying that resampling estimates are more conservative. In addition, we found that significance tests based on homogeneity statistics differed occasionally from results of randomization tests, implying that inferences based solely on chi-square significance tests may lead to erroneous conclusions. We conclude that resampling methods should be incorporated in meta-analysis studies, to ensure proper evaluation of main effects in ecological studies.

AB The slow-growth-high-mortality hypothesis predicts that prolonged development in herbivorous insects results in greater exposure to natural enemies and a subsequent increase in mortality. We tested this hypothesis using the cabbage butterfly Pieris rapae and its larval parasitoid Cotesia glomerata. We conducted a series of field and laboratory experiments to determine how variation in the larval development of P. rapae within and among four species of host plants (Brassica oleracea, Tropaeolum majus, Lunaria annua, and Cleome spinosa) influenced parasitism rates by C. glomerata. On the same host plant species, fast-developing larvae incurred less parasitism than slow-developing larvae of the same age, because once larvae reached the third instar they became much less vulnerable to attack due to the onset of encapsulation. Thus, the ''window of vulnerability'' was extended for slow-developing larvae. Similarly, the window of vulnerability was prolonged and larvae were susceptible to parasitism for a longer period of time on host plant species on which development was delayed. Also, simply exposing larvae for a longer period of time to parasitoids resulted in increased rates of parasitism. Consequently, the window of vulnerability sets the temporal limits within which parasitoids may act. These findings are all consistent with the slow-growth-high-mortality hypothesis.
   Slow growth, however, did not always translate into increased parasitism. We found no evidence for a positive relationship between host development time and parasitism when the relationship was examined across host plant species. In fact, the parasitism rate was highest on B. oleracea, the plant species on which P. rapae developed most rapidly. The adverse effects of some host plant species on the host-location behavior of parasitoids apparently offset the potential for increased risk of parasitism due to delayed larval development. In contrast, within the same host plant species, there was good correspondence between slow growth in P. rapae and high mortality inflicted by C. glomerata. We argue that the relative effects of plant variation on adult parasitoid behavior are probably much less among conspecific plants than across plant species, thus allowing the potential effects of extended development on increased parasitism to be realized. By experimentally manipulating larval development time using temperature and diet treatments (host plant effects removed), slow growth also resulted in increased parasitism.
   In a survey of published studies in which the association between slow growth and high enemy-inflicted mortality could be assessed, support for the hypothesis was found for free living insects feeding on the same or closely related host plant species. The hypothesis was not supported for herbivores that fed on different species of host plants, or for herbivores whose vulnerable stage was concealed in plant tissue. The extent to which the slow-growth-high-mortality hypothesis finds support depends on the interactive effects of plant variation on herbivore development as it indirectly increases the risk of enemy attack and on the direct effects of plant features on enemy access to herbivores.

AB Models of competition among dispersers from multiple natal sites are developed. Analytical solutions demonstrate that competition among identical dispersers may cause large variation in dispersal distances, and that increased competition may increase or decrease dispersal distances depending on the nature and magnitude of competition. This pattern is more complex than are results from previous models that ignored competition among dispersers. The analytical results are in accordance with results of a spatially explicit individual-based simulation model. When individuals disperse simultaneously from multiple nests and the number of dispersers exceeds the number of vacant territories, individuals that are close to vacancies are more likely to be the successful dispersers, and dispersal distances will decline with increased competition. Including competition among dispersers in models of natal dispersal improved predictions of the median dispersal distance of banner-tailed kangaroo rats and Song Sparrows.

AB The long-term relationship between major climatic change, vegetation change, and soil development is complex and poorly understood. In northeastern Hungary, for example, geochemical and pollen studies from a lake sedimentary sequence indicate that in the early postglacial, vegetation changed from a coniferous to deciduous forest, and soils from a podzol to brown earth. But which changed first? Did climatic warming result in a transformation from one soil type to another, which in turn resulted in a change in forest composition, or did the vegetation change first and subsequently alter the soil? How long did these soil transformation processes take? And what mechanisms were involved in the development of a brown-earth soil from a podzol? This paper presents the results of a study addressing some of these questions using palaeoecological analyses of a sedimentary sequence from lake Kis-Mohos To in northeastern Hungary. A proposed model for the process by which a podzol becomes transformed into a brown earth is presented, and possible triggering mechanisms are discussed. Results suggest that in northeastern Hungary the postglacial increase in deciduous populations was not consequent on soil type; rather, deciduous trees increased on podzolic soils, and this increase was one of the triggering mechanisms responsible for the development of brown-earth soils.

AB I investigated the age structure of breeding populations of Black-throated Blue Warblers (Dendroica caerulescens) in eastern North America. The proportion of yearling males increases as relative abundance decreases toward the margins of the breeding range. Geographic dines in age structure are hypothesized to correlate with gradients in habitat quality radiating from the Appalachian Mountains, the probable axis of source populations. Data from the southern Appalachians suggest that despotism of older males may impose a ceiling on the proportion of yearlings in saturated high-quality habitats, regardless of local productivity. Populations that exhibit low variance in yearling recruitment and high population densities may fall toward the ''source'' end of the ''source-sink'' continuum, and vice versa. It is hypothesized that the regional distribution of source and sink populations of the Black-throated Blue Warbler might closely mirror the prevalence of successful multiple brooding.

AB Aardwolves occur in east-central and southern Africa in regions of arid and semiarid grasslands. In South Africa, they feed almost exclusively on the termite Trinervitermes trinervoides during the warmer months of the year, whereas on cold winter nights these insects remain belowground, unavailable to aardwolves, At this time aardwolves shift their foraging efforts to a less abundant termite species, Hodotermes mossambicus. This species provides less food for aardwolves, making the wintertime potentially a period of energy stress for them.
   In this study, we report the first estimates of field metabolism and water flux as determined by doubly labeled water for a myrmecophagous euthermic mammal. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that a reduced basal metabolic rate and pulmocutaneous water loss lead to a conservative field metabolic rate (FMR) and water flux in free-living aardwolves during summer and winter. Further, we quantified the activity budget of aardwolves during summer and winter to construct a time-energy budget for them. We used knowledge of water flux in aardwolves and of the water content of their prey to construct a water budget during summer and winter, and to estimate the seasonal consumption of termites by aardwolves.
   During summer (November-January), aardwolves that averaged 7768 g in body mass had a CO2 production of 112.5 L CO2/d, equivalent to an energy expenditure of 2891.2 kJ/d. During winter (June-July), when body mass averaged 8543 g, CO2 production averaged 71.8 L CO2/d, which translates to an FMR of 1844.8 kJ/d. Water flux equaled 615 mL/d in summer, but only 292 mL/d in winter, a decrease of 53.1%.
   Aardwolves were active for an average of 8.77 h/d in summer, but only 4.05 h/d during winter. A time budget for active periods showed that aardwolves spent a significantly larger proportion of their active time feeding in summer than in winter (26.7 vs. 15.2%). In addition, males and females spent 12.6% of their time in winter in breeding activities such as courtship and copulation. For aardwolves in summer, our model estimated a DEE of 2370.5 kJ/d, whereas during winter it predicted a DEE of 2086 kJ/d. These values deviated from our estimates of FMR by -18% and +13.1%, respectively.
   From data on water flux and the water content of termites, we estimated that aardwolves consumed 222445 Trinervitermes per night during the summer. Using previously obtained data on foraging, we predicted that aardwolves consume 833 termites per patch with an intake rate of 33 termites per second while feeding. During winter, aardwolves consumed 5867 Hodotermes and 2515 Trinervitermes per night. Our estimate of gross energy consumption was 5616 kJ/d in summer and 3022 kJ/d in winter Assuming an assimilation efficiency of 0.66, metabolizable energy intake would be 3707 kJ/d in summer and 1995 kJ/d in winter. These values exceed FMR measurements by +22% in summer and by +8.1% in winter. It appears that aardwolves were in positive energy balance during our measurements of FMR.

AB Most damage caused by invertebrate herbivores is local and limited in extent and may therefore seem inconsequential. However, in addition to providing photosynthates to the whole plant, individual leaves may preferentially feed local sinks, including primordial meristems that develop later. For leaf damage, this may have local consequences and, in the case of preformed meristems, may result in time lags. To investigate such consequences and to determine the degree of independence among shoot modules, we studied shoot traits after damage to individual leaves in long shoots and vegetative and generative short shoots of field-growing mountain birch, Betula pubescens subsp. czerepanovii (Orlova) Hamet-Ahti.
   For short shoots, the results suggest that, due to the catkin, generative shoots have a higher priority in resource use than vegetative shoots. The overwinter survival of vegetative short shoots was decreased after their young leaves had been damaged early in the previous season. Otherwise, there were no significant effects of leaf damage on vegetative shoots. In generative shoots, leaf damage affected size and reproduction instead of survival. Because leaf damage significantly decreased leaf size in the generative shoots in the posttreatment year, leaves presumably competed with the catkin for resources within the shoot, Damage also reduced the catkin mass and the mean seed mass in the treatment year. In the posttreatment year, catkin mass and total seed mass were reduced by the treatments, but differences in the number of seeds and mean seed mass did not quite reach significance. The treatments had no effects on leaf mass of neighbors of vegetative or generative shoots in the treatment year or in the posttreatment year.
   In the treatment year, removal of long shoot leaves from a growing long shoot did not affect growth of the long shoot, indicating that such growth was supported by resources external to the shoot. However, local effects were evident in the posttreatment year: leaf mass decreased in shoots that developed from axillary buds in long shoots whose supporting leaves had been clipped in the previous year. Consequently, removal of individual leaves may have local effects on shoot survivorship, reproduction, and growth. Timing of damage and shoot type modified the consequences of local leaf damage, and there were no consistent responses for all situations. Due to the limited extent of damage, the effects were not likely to result from nutrient loss due to damage. Instead, consequences of local leaf damage could be explained largely by effects on local sinks and meristem primordia.

AB We review the effects of herbivory and other environmental factors on pollen performance in plants. We conclude that natural levels of variation in herbivory and other environmental factors during pollen development are often sufficient to cause significant differences in pollen performance, and that the differences in pollen performance are likely to be caused by differences in the provisioning of pollen grains. From an evolutionary perspective, we discuss how pollen and ovule provisioning may be negatively genetically correlated and how this would maintain genetic variation for pollen performance within populations. Furthermore, the highly plastic nature of pollen performance provides the potential for genotypes to respond differently to environmental variation (genotype-environment interactions), which would also promote the maintenance of genetic variation in pollen performance.

AB In a series of four field and mesocosm studies, we examined the effects of kinship on growth, survival, and aggregation behavior in tadpoles of the Cascades frog (Rana cascadae) under different ecological conditions. (1) Field observations of tadpole aggregations revealed ecological factors that may interact with kinship to influence tadpole interactions. (2) In an experiment conducted in mesocosms, food distribution, predator presence, thermal heterogeneity, and kinship all interacted to influence tadpole dispersion. (3) In a field experiment conducted in natural ponds, kinship significantly influenced group size at artificially established food patches. (4) In a field enclosure experiment, density, access to the substrate, and kinship all interacted to significantly influence growth and survivorship of tadpoles. Subsequent analysis revealed that kinship affected the distribution of individual tadpole body size: mass was more skewed (i.e., more small individuals) in groups of mixed relatedness than in kin groups. The interaction among kinship, density, and substrate factors resulted in context-dependent effects on tadpole size distribution and survivorship. Our results demonstrate that kinship factors can influence competitive interactions between tadpoles depending upon the ecological conditions, and they provide a functional explanation for kin-discriminating behavior observed in tadpoles of R. cascadae. Kinship-mediated competition may be particularly important for recruitment in size-structured populations.

AB We studied eight populations of the red-legged frog, Rana aurora, to examine responses of allotopic and syntopic tadpoles to the bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, an introduced predator of R. aurora. We also assessed predation rates by R. catesbeiana on syntopic and allotopic populations of R. aurora. Syntopic R. aurora tadpoles significantly reduced their activity and increased their refuge use when presented with the chemical cues of both tadpoles and adult R. catesbeiana. In contrast, allotopic tadpoles did not significantly alter their behavior in the presence of either R. catesbeiana adults or larvae. Predation by R. catesbeiana was lower in syntopic than in allotopic populations of R. aurora tadpoles. Our results show differential responses of syntopic and allotopic R. aurora tadpoles to larval and adult R. catesbeiana. Syntopic tadpoles avoid predation by R. catesbeiana more efficiently than do tadpoles from allotopic populations. Apparently, individuals that are unfamiliar with novel, introduced organisms may not possess adaptations that would prevent a negative encounter.

AB Our past focus on seed production as a surrogate for total plant fitness may have created a bias in our assessments of the effects of herbivory on plants. This bias may be especially pronounced if male and female plant fitness are differentially affected by damage. I describe the effects of leaf herbivory on several floral characters, including traits associated with male plant fitness. Changes in floral traits caused by foliar herbivory can also affect plant relationships with pollinators. Here, I highlight some understudied, indirect ways in which total plant fitness is affected by leaf herbivory. I then describe how considering these other routes to total plant fitness might contribute to current investigations on the evolution of plant defense and floral traits. Because data are lacking on several important aspects of these relationships, this contribution focuses primarily on new ideas and approaches to determining how herbivores and pollinators together shape plant characters.

AB I present a model which at the same time evaluates optimal diel vertical migration (DVM) and optimal allocation patterns to growth or reproduction in the cladoceran Daphnia magna. The combined policies that maximize the intrinsic rate of increase r are found using the Perron Frobenius Theorem and dynamic programming. The model attempts to incorporate two traditions in aquatic behavioral ecology within the same model framework: variations in vertical migrations (short time behavior) and age or size at maturity (life history models). The predictions from the model are compared with observations from an experiment: in thermally stratified flow-through tubes containing various concentrations of fish exudates. The model is able to reproduce many of the observations of both DVM and allocation, though there are some interesting deviations. I look at theoretical behavior and life history consequences of various size dependencies in mortality. Finally, I do a comparative analysis of two fitness measures, the intrinsic rate of increase r, and the net lifetime reproduction, R-0, where it turns out that the use of r makes predictions in better agreement with the observations.

We hypothesize that leaf teeth may be important to deciduous species as sites of precocious, early season photosynthesis, To test this hypothesis we dosed leaves with (CO2)-C-14 and used autoradiography to examine the spatial distribution of photosynthesis within immature leaves of 18 woody species of North Carolina Piedmont; forests, We found a significant concentration of early season photosynthesis on the margins of eight species with prominent teeth or lobes, but not in seven toothed or lobed leaf species and in none of the four entire-leaf species.

AB Nutrients used in reproduction may come from adult feeding or reserves stored from the juvenile stage. The dynamics of allocation from these sources are predicted to differ among nutrient types, depending on the relative availability of each nutrient type from adult and juvenile feeding. Using radiotracer techniques, I examined reproductive allocation of glucose and amino acids from adult and juvenile sources in two nymphalid butterflies, Euphydryas editha and Speyerin mormonia. The species used were intermediate in expected importance of adult nutrients to egg production, with abundant carbohydrates but few nitrogenous compounds available from the adult diet. As predicted, for compounds abundantly available in the adult diet, incoming nutrients were used in preference to stored nutrients. For compounds present in low amounts in the adult diet, juvenile reserves were used throughout adult life, although adult sources were used if available. Nutrients received by the female from the male at mating, although expected to be treated as stored reserves, were immediately used in egg production. Thus, restriction of adult or juvenile feeding may cause different nutrient types (e.g., carbohydrates, nitrogenous compounds) to become limiting to reproduction. These results are consistent with earlier allocation studies examining age-specific changes in body mass and reproductive effort, and the effects on fecundity of quantitative adult food reduction. The work has implications for understanding the evolution of nutrient types donated by males to females, the effects of a holometabolous lifestyle on age-specific fecundity, and the effects of using stored reserves vs. income in reproduction. The present results allow further predictions concerning effects of food supply perturbation on fecundity and, hence, population dynamics, and suggest ways in which species and individuals will differ in sensitivity to those perturbations.

AB We examined patch use of deer mice foraging in the presence vs. the absence of red imported fire ants in a laboratory experiment. We tested the H = P + C + MOC patch use model (H, harvest rate; P, predation risk; C, metabolic costs; MOC, missed opportunity costs), an extension of the marginal-value theorem, by comparing in-patch harvest rates and giving-up densities (GUDs) in the presence and the absence of fire ants: The model predicts that foragers should seek patches that yield higher feeding rates in the presence of increased costs. GUDs also should increase, since they should correlate directly with quitting-harvest rates, as long as the forager experiences diminishing returns on its rate of resource harvest. We identified behavioral trade-offs made by deer mice when foraging in the presence of fire ants. In the presence of fire ants, mice harvested a greater proportion of seeds from, spent more time in, and made more visits to rich patches than to poor, whereas in the absence of fire ants, these variables did not differ between rich and poor patches. Mice also increased their in-patch harvest rate in the presence of fire ants, as predicted by the H = P + C + MOC model, but harvested patches to a lower GUD. Mice left patches at lower final seed densities, but were able to maintain a higher mean in-patch harvest rate, suggesting that mice foraged more efficiently in the presence of fire ants. When fire ants were present, deer mice spent more time on out-of-patch handling (fire ants were confined to patches). Despite increased costs or lost time due to taking seeds away from the ants for consumption, mice were able to harvest the same number of seeds in the same total time, at the same mean harvest rate. By biasing effort toward more energetically profitable rich patches and by increasing their in-patch harvest rate, deer mice were able to obtain the same net yield in the same time, despite increased costs.

AB A role for pathogens in plant competition has often been suggested, but examples are rare and, in the case of soil pathogens, virtually absent. In this paper we examine if and how soil-borne pathogens may play a role in plant competition. As a model, two successional plant species from coastal sand dunes were used: Ammophila arenaria (marram grass) and Festuca rubra sap. arenaria (sand fescue). The root zone of A. arenaria contains pathogens that contribute to the degeneration of their host when dunes become stabilized. These pathogens (plant parasitic nematodes and pathogenic fungi) are relatively harmless to the immediate successor F. rubra. We tested the hypothesis that F. rubra, when gown in a mixed culture with A. arenaria, will be favored when A. arenaria is exposed to soil-borne pathogens from its own root zone.
   In a greenhouse, seedlings of both species were grown in replacement series in sterilized (pathogen-free) and unsterilized (pathogen-containing) soils originating from the root zone of natural A. arenaria. Nutrient additions, soil moisture, and the length of the experiment were based on two pilot studies. When exposed to its soil-borne pathogens, A. arenaria was outcompeted, especially when it constituted <50% of the planted mixture. Nutrient limitation enhanced the replacement of A. arenaria by F. rubra especially in unsterilized soil. This was due to reduced plasticity of A. arenaria in responding to nutrient limitation when exposed to its pathogens. The present results support previous suggestions that soil pathogen-driven competition may be an important mechanism in species replacement in coastal foredune vegetation.

AB A 5-yr field study examined the ways in which prey abundance can influence the reproductive rates of predators. Water pythons (Liasis fuscus) on the Adelaide River floodplain in tropical Australia prey almost exclusively on dusky rats (Rattus colletti). Rat numbers varied dramatically among years of the study. Feeding rates of pythons were highest when rats were abundant, and the snakes were in good condition (mass relative to body length) at these times. The proportion of adult female pythons that reproduced in a given year was also tightly linked to rat abundances. However, reproductive output per litter (offspring size, and fecundity relative to maternal body size) was unaffected by prey availability, perhaps because of high fecundity-independent costs of reproduction. Instead, female pythons reproducing in ''good'' years were in better condition after oviposition.
   These data support an energy-limitation model for snake reproduction, whereby prey availability determines predator reproductive output, but the relationship between the two variables is complex. The degree to which prey availability influences feeding rates of pythons and the degree to which feeding rates influence body condition depend crucially on snake body size (due to size-related shifts in foraging abilities and metabolic costs). Thus, a given prey abundance translates into different energy reserves for different-sized predators. Also, females delay reproduction until they can gain enough energy for a large clutch of eggs, and reproductive output per litter does not then increase with additional energy availability. Such nonlinearities in predator responses to prey availability may be widespread.

AB Zooplankton live in environments where resource abundance and quality can vary drastically over time. Success in nonequilibrium environments depends in part on the ability to store energy and control its allocation during periods of extreme food limitation or outright starvation. Starvation resistance is one measure of the ability of a species to persist when energy intake is less than energy expenditure. The life-history responses of nine species of planktonic rotifers to food deprivation were compared using cohort life-table experiments. Allometric patterns of energy storage and respiration rate lead to the prediction that larger species should have greater starvation resistance than smaller species. Contrary to this prediction, when rotifers were acclimated to high resource levels and starved as young adults, body mass did not predict starvation time, Rather, there was a trade-off between survival and reproduction during starvation. Some species did not reproduce during starvation and had high starvation times (up to 5.0 d). Other species maintained or increased fecundity relative to fed controls and had low starvation times (as low as 0.4 d). Species with more rapid senescence when fed tended to have shorter starvation times. However, the interspecific trade-off between survival and reproduction remained after removing the effect of control survivorship. Differences in life-history responses to starvation may be critical in determining competitive outcome and community structure in variable environments.
   When acclimated to low food levels prior to food deprivation, simulating conditions of declining resource abundance in nature, rotifer starvation time decreased. Juveniles had longer starvation times than adults, further supporting the idea that allocating energy to reproduction decreases starvation resistance.

AB Aerial photographs were used to analyze long-term canopy dynamics over 15 yr in a large area (25.25 ha) for a mixed deciduous forest in the Ogawa Forest Reserve, central Japan. Digital elevation models of canopy surface were made from aerial photographs taken in four summers at 5-yr intervals from 1976 to 1991. A digital elevation model of ground surface was also made from the aerial photograph taken in winter 1991. The canopy height at each location was calculated from the elevational difference between the canopy and the ground, and the ''vegetation profile technique'' was applied to quantify canopy dynamics. The size distributions of gaps at each observation time and of gaps that were created between observation times followed a power function model. While the rates of gap formation and closure throughout the whole period were nearly balanced, they showed large temporal variations among the observation periods. Spatial distribution of newly created gaps was significantly biased toward the edges of old gaps. Probability of repeated gap creation was also significantly high. Analysis of changes in the canopy height profile by a transition probability matrix showed that gap area distribution of this forest may be nearly in a steady state.

AB The use of molecular genetic techniques is becoming increasingly widespread in analyses of hybrid zones. Yet, exactly how many molecular markers are required to provide a given degree of resolution remains an open question. We present statistical models that relate the number of markers examined to their power to discriminate between pure species, F1's, and backcross individuals. Our models indicate that only about four or five markers are required to provide a coarse classification of individuals in hybrid zones, whereas upwards of 70 markers are required to discriminate between pure species and advanced backcrosses. The models provide hybrid zone researchers a basis upon which to balance the time and expense of examining large numbers of markers against the magnitude of classification errors when smaller numbers of markers are examined.

AB Variation in competitive ability due to variation in soil characteristics is one possible mechanism allowing the local coexistence of plant species. We measured soil water, depth, and nitrogen pools and fluxes in distinct patches of three serpentine grassland species to determine whether soil heterogeneity existed and was correlated with plant species abundance. Through experimental manipulation of species' abundances, we also examined the relative importance of inherent site characteristics vs. plant species' effects in generating heterogeneity in the measured soil characteristics; and measured species' competitive abilities in different patch types. The three common grassland annuals, Calycndenia multiglandulosum, Plantago erecta, and Lasthenia californica, were segregated with respect to the measured soil characteristics. Differences in soil water, soil depth, soil microbial nitrogen, and soil carbon to nitrogen ratio were due to inherent site characteristics, while differences in nitrate availability were strongly affected by the identity of the species currently growing in a soil patch. Furthermore, all species performed significantly better against one other species in the patch type where they are normally most abundant. These results demonstrate that species diversity within this grassland contributes to soil heterogeneity and suggest that soil heterogeneity could contribute to the coexistence of these species.

AB In small-scale field and related laboratory experiments, I examined the immediate and delayed effects of nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) introduction and density on the performance of Malacosoma californicum pluviale. In a factorial experiment, larvae at high density showed increased feeding and development rates and decreased reproductive potential. The introduction of NPV significantly increased per capita mortality of the host, particularly at high density, and generally reduced host reproductive potential. Adults from this experiment were mated and their offspring reared in the laboratory. Pupal mass of female offspring was influenced by treatments in the parental generation, whereas egg viability, larval development time and mortality, and pupal mass of male offspring were not. M. c. pluviale introduced to host trees the year following the factorial experiment showed no effects of previous caterpillar density on mortality or reproductive potential, as would be predicted by host-plant induction theory. An interactive effect of previous virus introduction and density on mortality was observed due to the persistence of NPV in the environment. Results are discussed in light of population dynamics and observed changes in fecundity in tent caterpillar populations.

AB Many plants respond to herbivory by decreasing the nutritional quality of their foliage and increasing production of allelochemicals. These induced responses are defensive if they reduce future tissue loss or disperse future damage and, as a result, increase fitness relative to canspecifics with a weaker induced response. We assessed three predicted effects of early-season damage in white oak (Quercus alba L.): (1) early-season damage elicits both systemic and localized responses in leaf quality; (2) mid- and late-season herbivores respond to changes in leaf quality both among and within trees; and (3) plants with high early-season damage suffer less subsequent tissue loss than plants with low early-season damage.
   In a field experiment, we manipulated levels of early-season damage in white oak saplings and monitored subsequent changes in leaf quality, herbivore distributions, and plant damage levels at two spatial scales: (1) between experimental and control trees differing in overall level of early-season damage, and (2) between damaged and undamaged leaves within individual trees. One-third of the plants had herbivores removed at 2-3 d intervals throughout the early-season, one-third had damage from natural densities of herbivores plus additional damage from hale-punching, and one-third were attacked by natural densities of herbivores and served as controls.
   Early-season treatments influenced leaf quality both among and within trees. We observed differences in protein-binding capacity (PBC) among treatments, indicating a systemic response to early-season damage for this trait. The treatment with the most early-season damage (control) had higher average protein-binding capacity than the treatment with the lowest level of early-season damage (herbivore-removal treatment). Within trees, damaged leaves (>10% leaf area missing) had higher protein-binding capacity and lower nitrogen content than intact leaves (less than or equal to 10% leaf area missing), suggesting localized induction to herbivory for these traits. Despite differences in protein-binding capacity among treatments, herbivore densities did not differ among treatments at any time following the early season. In addition, species composition of herbivores did not differ among treatments. However, within individual trees, herbivore densities were higher on intact leaves than on damaged leaves. This finding is consistent with patterns of leaf quality: intact leaves were higher quality (i.e., more nitrogen and lower PBC) and had higher herbivore densities than damaged leaves. Because herbivores appeared to avoid previously damaged leaves, induction may have led to dispersed damage in this study. Finally, saplings that suffered the highest level of early-season damage (controls) had less subsequent damage than saplings with the lowest amount of early-season damage (herbivore-removal). This result supports the hypothesis that leaf quality changes following insect herbivory reduce subsequent damage to individual plants.

AB Bears consuming wild fruits for fall energy accumulation are constrained by several factors, including intake rate, the physiological capacity of the gastrointestinal tract, and the metabolic efficiency of gain in body mass. We measured these relationships through foraging and feeding trials using captive and wild black bears (Ursus americanus) and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos). Four fruit types covering a range of sizes and clustering were offered to captive bears to determine the effect of density, size, and presentation on intake rate. Intake rate (in grams per minute) and bite rates (in bites per minute) increased curvilinearly with increasing fruit density in singly spaced fruits. Maximum intakes ranged from 30 g/min for 0.5-g berries to > 200 g/min for 4.2-g fruits. The highest bite rates were obtained during the initial encounter with each patch as bears consumed all visually apparent fruits on the surface. Bite rates quickly dropped by 15-20% as foraging continued within the patch. Maximum bite rates were not depressed until initial fruit density fell to < 50 berries/m(3). Maximum daily fresh fruit intake for the captive bears averaged 34 +/- 6% (mean +/- 1 SD) of body mass. The dry-matter digestibility of wild fruits, particularly preferred species, was as high as 72%. While large captive bears could gain body mass very rapidly when given fruit ad libitum, foraging efficiencies increasingly constrained growth rates of wild bears > 100 kg. We concluded that large bears, such as grizzlies, must depend on plants that permit large bite sizes or high bite rates through fruit clustering and bush configuration that reduce leaf-to-fruit ratios.

AB Resilience is a component of ecological stability; it is assessed as the rate at which perturbations to a stable ecological system decay. The most frequently used estimate of resilience is based on the eigenvalues of the system at its equilibrium. In most cases, this estimate describes the rate of recovery only asymptotically, as time goes to infinity. However, in the short term, perturbations can grow significantly before they decay, and eigenvalues provide no information about this transient behavior. We present several new measures of transient response that complement resilience as a description of the response to perturbation. These indices measure the extent and duration of transient growth in models with asymptotically stable equilibria. They are the reactivity (the maximum possible growth rate immediately following the perturbation), the maximum amplification (the largest proportional deviation that can be produced by any perturbation), and the time at which this amplification occurs. We demonstrate the calculation of these indices using previously published linear compartment models (two models for phosphorus cycling through a lake ecosystem and one for the flow of elements through a tropical rain forest) and a standard nonlinear predator-prey model. Each of these models exhibits transient growth of perturbations, despite asymptotic stability. Measures of relative stability that ignore transient growth will often give a misleading picture of the response to a perturbation.

AB Roots are widely acknowledged to be major contributors to ecosystem nutrient cycles. However, live roots may have very different effects than dead roots, the quality of the soil surrounding the roots may itself affect the influence of the roots, and the nature of the soil profile may modify all of these interactions. We have used experimental, field-based mesocosms to dissect the differing effects of live and dead roots in organic and mineral horizons of spodosolic forest soils, Mesocosms were constructed in a simple ecosystem dominated by pitch pine (Pinus rigida Mill.) and blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) in the New Jersey Pinelands. They contained 5 cm deep surface horizons of either organic matter or an inert substitute (vermiculite), placed above 10 cm of mineral material from the E horizon, with defined amounts of live or dead roots added. Sampling was conducted over a 2-yr period. In mineral soil, live roots stimulated ammonification rates but had little effect on extractable N, and the stimulation occurred only if an organic surface horizon was present. In contrast, live roots in organic material reduced both ammonification rates and extractable N. Dead roots increased extractable N in the mineral material, but not the organic material. The presence or absence of an organic horizon had a dominating effect on all aspects of nitrogen dynamics in the mineral soil; not only extractable inorganic N, but also transformation rates, were higher in soils under organic matter. The results showed that the effects of roots on soil nutrients depended on (1) the ratio of live to dead root biomass, (2) the quality of the soil material in which the roots occurred, and (3) the structure of the soil profile. These findings necessitate a revision of the concept of ''rhizosphere effect'' in forest soils.

AB do female desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) reproduce every year despite variability in winter rainfall and food availability? To answer this question, I measured energy budgets of individual female desert tortoises from July 1987 to July 1989. Females produced eggs in years with low levels of winter annual plants by relaxing their control of energy and water homeostasis. They tolerated large deficits and surpluses in their body dry-matter composition (both nonlipid and lipid) on a seasonal, annual, and longer time scale. They could increase body energy content (lipid and nonlipid energy) before winter and use this reserve (especially nonlipid energy) the following spring to produce eggs. Females used high-protein foods and rainwater, when available, to achieve energy surpluses that helped them survive periods of low resource availability (e.g., during hibernation and droughts). Adjusting seasonal and annual field metabolic rates (FMR) and food requirements to levels of food availability, they still managed to produce eggs, even in a drought year.
   Egg production in 1988 (mean +/- 1 so: 3.56 +/- 1.94 eggs, N = 9) did not differ from that in 1989 (3.00 +/- 2.69 eggs, N = 9); both were lower than during 1983-1987 (6.75 +/- 3.05 eggs, N = 100). Energy per se did not limit egg production in 1988 and 1989, but the availability of nonlipid energy (probably protein) limited egg production in 1988 and was limiting in spring 1989. Yet, water was the primary resource limiting egg production in 1989. Females forgoing egg production in 1989 accumulated body nonlipid energy and lost less total body water than did females producing eggs. Females that produced eggs in 1989 forfeited body nonlipid energy.
   In 1988 and 1989, the paucity of new annual plants in spring contributed to a lower egg production. The amount of annuals that germinate in summer can affect egg production, because females stored nonlipid energy during summer 1988 when eating these annuals, and allocated this energy to eggs in the following spring (1989). Tortoises stored lipids during summer when consuming dry annuals. These lipids are critical for surviving the winter, but females forfeited body water and nonlipid dry matter to digest the dry annuals.
   Reproductive effort (RE) was higher during the drought year (July 1988-July 1989: RE = 26.1%)than during the wetter year (July 1987-July 1988: RE = 13.0%) because tortoises reduced FMR by 70-90% in 1989. Compared to two other chelonians, RE of desert tortoises was consistent with the K-selected trend of lower RE for larger, long-lived, and late-maturing species. Forfeiting body condition to produce only a few eggs, even under a great environmental stress, was consistent with a life history strategy called bet hedging.

AB We investigated the effects of native ungulates on grassland N cycling in Yellowstone National Park by examining natural N-15 abundance (delta(15)N) of soils and plants inside and outside long-term (32-36 yr) exclosures. Across six topographically diverse sites, grazers increased delta(15)N Of soil (0-20 cm) by 0.7 parts per thousand, which was substantial considering that values for ungrazed soil ranged 2.4 parts per thousand (2.4-4.8 parts per thousand). The magnitude of grazer N-15 enrichment was positively related (r(2) = 0.70) to the intensity of herbivore activity during the study, indexed by the amount of dung (g/m(2)) deposited at the sites. We also found that soil delta(15)N Of ungulate urine and dung patches was significantly higher than that of control areas. Grazers probably increased soil delta(15)N by promoting N loss from the soil via leaching, ammonia volatilization, and/or denitrification. Each of these processes results in the removal of N-15 depleted products from the soil and, consequently, N-15 enrichment of the remaining soil. In contrast to soil results, grazers reduced plant N-15 by an average of 0.7 parts per thousand, probably due to isotopically light, soil NO3-(compared to soil NH4+) constituting a more important N source for plants in grazed grassland relative to those in ungrazed grassland.
   These findings indicate that native grazers increased N loss from this north-temperate grassland as a result of accelerated losses on urine-and dung-affected microsites and, potentially, from elevated N loss throughout the grazed landscape due to grazers promoting N cycling. Furthermore, these results suggest that herbivores increase plant NO3-assimilation, which may positively affect primary productivity in this grazed ecosystem.

AB The evolution of resistance by insect and weed pests to chemical pesticides is a problem of increasing importance in applied ecology. It is striking that the evolution of resistance by target pest species in biological control is much less frequently reported, particularly in control involving parasitoids and predators, rather than pathogens. Although it is conceivable that this reflects biases in reporting or frequency of application, we suggest that there is a puzzle here worthy of scrutiny, and we outline several potential underlying causes. In order of discussion (not necessarily of importance), these are: (1) lack of genetic variation; (2) genetic constraints on selection; (3) weak selection; (4) temporally varying selection; and (5) coevolutionary dynamics. We, in particular, focus on the potential for weak selection on the host for increased resistance, despite effective control. The very spatial mechanisms (e.g., refuges, metapopulation dynamics) believed to facilitate the persistence of many natural enemy-victim systems with strong biological control may also incidentally provide an environment where selection is weak on target pests to evolve improved resistance to control agents, thereby biasing coevolution toward the enemy. The basic insight is that in a spatially heterogeneous environment, a strong limiting factor on a population can be a weak selective factor. The hypotheses presented here provide ingredients needed to predict which biological control systems might be evolutionarily stable, and which not. Our aim in this thought piece is to stimulate more attention to the evolutionary dimension of biological control systems.

AB Senescent decline in survival probabilities of animals is a topic about which much has been written but little is known. Here, we present formal tests of senescence hypotheses, using 1373 recaptures from 8877 duckling (age 0) and 504 yearling Common Pochards (Aythya ferina) banded at a Latvian study site, 1975-1992. The tests are based on capture-recapture models that explicitly incorporate sampling probabilities that, themselves, may exhibit time- and age-specific variation. The tests provided no evidence of senescent decline in survival probabilities for this species. Power of the most useful test was low for gradual declines in annual survival probability with age, but good for steeper declines. We recommend use of this type of capture-recapture modeling and analysis for other investigations of senescence in animal survival rates.

AB Changes in the biomass of benthic bivalves can cause dramatic changes in total grazing pressure in aquatic systems, but few studies document ecosystem-level impacts of these changes. This study documents a massive decline in phytoplankten biomass concurrent with the invasion of an exotic benthic bivalve, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), and demonstrates that the zebra mussel actually caused this decline. In the fall of 1992 the zebra mussel became established at high biomass in the Hudson River Estuary, and biomass of mussels remained high during 1993 and 1994. During these 2 yr, grazing pressure on phytoplankton was over 10-fold greater than it had been prior to the zebra mussel invasion. This increased grazing was associated with an 85% decline in phytoplankton biomass. Between 1987 and 1991 (pre-invasion), summertime chlorophyll averaged 30 mg/m(3); during 1993 and 1994 summertime concentrations were <5 mg/m(3). Over this same period, light availability increased, phosphate concentrations doubled, some planktonic grazers declined, and average flow was not different from the pre-invasion period, Thus, changes in these other factors were not responsible for phytoplankton declines.
   We developed a mechanistic model that reproduces the spatial and temporal dynamics of phytoplankton prior to the invasion of the zebra mussel (1987-1991). The model accurately predicts extreme declines in phytoplankton biomass after the invasion (1993-1994). The model demonstrates that zebra mussel grazing was sufficient to cause the observed phytoplankton decline. The model also allows us to test which features make the Hudson River sensitive to the impact of benthic grazers. The model suggests that the fate of lightscattering inorganic particles (turbidity) is a key feature determining the impact of benthic grazers in aquatic systems.

AB Field experiments involving local manipulations of predator densities are an important tool for studying the role of predation in natural communities. I use mathematical models to investigate how treatment effects should vary with the size of the area manipulated in open predation experiments, i.e., in studies that allow prey to migrate in and out from experimental units. The most general result is that the influence of prey movements on prey densities decreases with increasing spatial scale of an experiment, while the effect of predation rate is independent of scale. Thus, the results seen in small-scale experiments tend to reflect prey movements, while the effects seen in large-scale experiments are due mainly to predator-related mortality.
   If predation rates are spatially variable (e.g., the habitat consists of refuge patches and predator-rich patches) the problem becomes mere complex, because movement rates influence predation rates. Movements that are independent of predator density can swamp the effects of predation mortality in small-scale experiments. However; in larger scale experiments, the effect of movements is to increase the predation rate. This is because a larger proportion of the prey is exposed to predators at high movement rates.
   Predators can also affect local densities through effects on prey behavior. If prey increase movement rates out from predator patches, this will lead to increased treatment effects in small-scale experiments. In contrast, the result of such behaviors is to decrease treatment effects in large-scale experiments, because most prey will be in refuge parches and predation rates will be low. Alternatively, sometimes predators cause prey to decrease activity when close to a predator. This kind of behavioral response leads to decreased treatment effects in small-scale experiments. If the response is strong, the result can even be a reversed effect, i.e., reduced movements out from predator cages lead to increased prey densities in such cages. I argue that the effect of this type of behavior in large-scale experiments should also be to decrease treatment effects. This is because predation rates are usually low on inactive prey. However, freezing behaviors cannot lead to reversed predator effects on a large scale.

AB Multilevel selection theory, which has been used to explain the functional organization of individuals and single-species social groups, can be extended to explain the functional organization of multispecies communities. Adaptation at lower levels of the biological hierarchy, such as the individual, does not automatically lead to adaptation at higher levels. Community-level functional organization therefore requires a process of natural selection among local communities that vary in their species and/or genetic composition. Community-level selection has been demonstrated in the laboratory and is plausible for many natural communities. Mutualism, strong ecological effects, and complex systems dynamics do not by themselves produce functional organization and therefore should be studied in conjunction with multilevel selection theory.

AB This paper explores the ecological consequences of competition and cooperation, and the resultant abrupt species zonation that could occur along smooth environmental stress gradients. We present one-and two-species models of sessile organisms incorporating competition for space and two forms of cooperation: habitat amelioration and positive recruitment. In these models, habitat amelioration reduces an organism's mortality rate when it is surrounded by other organisms (''safety-in-numbers''), and positive intraspecific recruitment enables juveniles to use the shelter of established individuals as settlement (or germination) sites. A single-species model incorporating both forms of cooperation may exhibit sharp discontinuities in population density along an environmental gradient. In a two-species model the same mechanisms may lead to sharp boundaries in species composition if, as empirical studies suggest, a trade-off exists between colonization and cooperation abilities (e.g., strong cooperators are poor colonizers). Positive interspecific recruitment obscures the interspecific boundaries.

AB Forests in the White Mountain region (New Hampshire, USA) range from northern hardwoods and pine at low elevations to spruce-fir at middle elevations, subalpine fir, and krummholz on mountain peaks. We studied landscape-scale effects of gradients in forest cover type, litter chemistry, rates of litter input (including fine woody litter), temperature, and moisture on forest-floor pools and input-output fluxes of C and N. We coupled a new model of decomposition processes to a Geographic Information System (CIS) and applied it in 10-ha cells in the White Mountain National Forest. We sought to synthesize current understanding of forest-floor leachate qualities and quantities in humid forests with measured changes in carbon fractions (''lignin,'' ''cellulose,'' and ''extractives'') in decomposing litter. We included N dynamics as transfers of N among C fractions, including the production of dissolved organic N in leachate from the forest floor. We calibrated fluxes of dissolved organic C and N (DOG and DON) to measurements from two stands at the Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA. We calibrated rates of humus decay to two sites at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. By including leaching as a mechanism of mass loss from the forest floor, we were able to calculate CO2 mineralization fluxes by difference. Predicted masses of forest floor were higher and peaked over a broader elevational range in spruce-fir forest than in hardwoods, due primarily to a slower decay sate of humus in coniferous forests. DOC and DON fluxes were higher in coniferous forests, while CO2 fluxes were higher in hardwood forests.
   Predicted residence times for C in the forest floor were longer, and organic N concentrations were higher in spruce-fir forests than in hardwood forests. Along a generalized elevational ecotone from hardwood to spruce-fir forests in the region, predicted mass and N in the forest floor increased and DOC and DON fluxes increased, while CO2 fluxes decreased.

AB Previous work on phenotypic plasticity in hatchling reptiles has dealt almost exclusively with lizards and turtles from temperate zone habitats, in taxa where the only maternal control over incubation regimes is exerted via nest site selection. In contrast, water pythons (Liasis fuscus) in northern Australia are tropical snakes that show facultative maternal brooding, with shivering thermogenesis to warm the clutch. Thus, incubation temperatures of this species are influenced both by nest site selection and by maternal care. We experimentally simulated three thermal regimes typical of different types of natural nests in our study population. These were (1) hot, stable temperatures typical of nests laid in the burrows of varanid lizards (constant 32 degrees C); (2) lower and more variable temperatures typical of nests laid inside tree root boles, either with maternal attendance (diel range 27.1 degrees - 32.9 degrees C); or (3) in root boles but without maternal attendance (24.3 degrees - 32.9 degrees C). We incubated 187 eggs from 15 clutches obtained from field-caught gravid pythons, using a split-clutch design to quantify influences on morphology (offspring size and shape), locomotor performance (swimming ability), and behavior (escape tactics, propensity to strike, willingness to feed in captivity). The thermal regime during incubation strongly affected incubation periods, body sizes, body shapes (mass and tail length relative to snout-vent length), initial growth rates, escape behavior, and willingness to feed. We also detected strong maternal effects on all of these traits, and interactions between maternal effects and incubation regimes. Thus, a female python's ''decisions'' as to where she lays her eggs and whether she remains and broods them through development have major consequences for the phenotypes of her offspring.

AB For decades, plant ecologists have used naturally occurring stable isotope ratios to disentangle ecological and physiological processes. The methodology can also become a very powerful tool in animal ecology. However, the application of the technique relies on assumptions that are not widely recognized and that have been rarely tested. The purpose of this communication is to identify these assumptions, to characterize the conditions in which they are not met, and to suggest the laboratory experiments that are needed to validate them. The ease with which isotopic data can be gathered and the growing popularity of the method are generating a large amount of data on the isotopic ecology of animals. The proper interpretation of these data demands that we identify the assumptions on which these inferences are based, and that we conduct comparative laboratory experiments to assess their validity.

AB The functional response is an essential component of any predator-prey interaction. We present a model to predict changes in a predator's functional response at varying spatial scales of resource distribution and abundance. The model was tested using free-ranging fox squirrels, Sciurus niger, foraging for sunflower seeds in experimental food patches. We manipulated initial density of food at three spatial scales: foraging (initial abundance varied from patch to patch at a single station); intermediate (initial abundance varied from station to station at a single site) and landscape (initial abundance varied from site to site). We measured the giving-up density of seeds (GUD: food remaining in patches) following a day of foraging, allowing determination of the proportion and amount of food harvested. We predicted that foragers should harvest more resources from rich patches than from poor patches at the foraging scale and that foragers should harvest more resources from a patch in a poor environment than in a rich environment at the landscape scale. The results tightly corresponded with the predictions. At the foraging scale, there was an increase in the proportion of seeds harvested with increasing initial food abundance. At the landscape scale, the opposite was true. At the intermediate scale, the proportion of food harvested did not vary with initial abundance of seeds. The shapes of the functional response curves differed at each of the three spatial scales. With respect to proportion of food harvested with food abundance, they were similar to a Holling Type III (sigmoid) response at the foraging scale, to a Type I (linear) response at the intermediate scale, and to a Type II (decelerating) response at the landscape scale.

AB This investigation examines the role of trait-mediated indirect interactions in a simple aquatic food web. We conducted the experiments in cattle watering tanks in order to establish whether competitive and predator-prey interactions between two species are affected by other species in the system; i.e., are pairwise interaction strengths affected by the background species assemblage? We examined the survival and growth response of small bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and small green frog (Rana clamitans) tadpoles in the presence and absence of a competitor (large bullfrogs), the lethal presence of the larval odonate predator Tramea lacerata, and the nonlethal (caged) presence of the larval odonate predators Anax junius and Anax longipes. We demonstrate that large bullfrog competitors and caged Anax affect traits (foraging activity level) of small bullfrog and small green frog tadpoles and that these changes in traits, in turn, affect interactions of the small tadpole species with each other and with the other species. In particular, the following four trait-mediated indirect interactions were evident: (1) Presence of large bullfrog competitors increased the predation rate of Tramea on small green frogs and small bullfrogs. (2) Presence of nonlethal Anax reduced the predation rate of Tramea on small green frogs. (3) Presence of nonlethal Anax increased the competitive advantage of bullfrogs over green frogs. (4) Presence of nonlethal Anax facilitated midge invasion of the experimental units. The proposed mechanisms (changes in small tadpole activity) involved in these trait-mediated indirect interactions were supported by observational data on tadpole activity and resource levels in the experimental units, and in laboratory experiments examining tadpole activity responses to predators. The occurrence of strong trait-mediated indirect interactions in this simple food web underscores the potential importance of such interactions in animal communities.

AB The internal demographic structure of a population influences its dynamics and its response to the environment. Most models for phytoplankton ignore internal structure and group all cells in a single variable such as total biomass or density. However, a cell does have a life history, the cell division cycle. We investigate the significance of the cell cycle to phytoplankton population dynamics in a variable nutrient environment, using chemostat models. Following the transition point hypothesis, nutrient uptake affects cell development only within a limited segment of the cell cycle. Simulation results demonstrate oscillations in cell numbers and population structure generated by this interaction. When nutrient input is varied periodically, the population displays an aperiodic response with frequencies different from that of the forcing. These results also hold for a model that includes nutrient storage by the cells. These dynamics differ from those of traditional chemostat models and from cell cycle models driven by light cycles. Resource control of cell cycle progression may explain the time delays previously postulated to explain oscillatory transients in chemostat experiments.

AB The breeding population of Semipalmated Sandpipers at La Perouse Bay, Churchill, Manitoba declined sharply during the 1980s. Using demographic information collected during eight summers of field work we built a stochastic matrix population model. The model successfully reconstructed the observed decline in the population during the course of the study. The predictions of the model agreed with the observed population level in 1993, 5 yr after the study was completed. Sensitivity analysis showed that the population trend was most sensitive to changes in adult survivorship and to immigration of adults onto the site. We ran simulations to consider five possible reasons for the decline: (1) low adult survivorship, (2) low fecundity, (3) delayed recruitment into the population, (3) low juvenile survivorship, and (5) insufficient immigration. For biologically reasonable values of these parameters, only adult survivorship and immigration rates could account for the observed decline, although juvenile survival also had some impact. These simulations also illustrate that sensitivity is a complex function of the demographic variables, and in particular, sensitivity to adult survival varies across the range of adult survival values that we considered. In addition, we used the model to explore the influence of annual variability in demographic parameters. It is known that the general effect of annual variation is to depress population trends. We showed that the sensitivity of the model to annual variability in survival is tied to the sensitivity of the model to changes in mean values of survival. With the empirical parameter values from this local population, we found that, when survival is high enough to promote stability of the population, the population is highly sensitive to the level of survival, and also to the amount of annual variability in survival. By contrast, the model is not very sensitive to fecundity and is correspondingly insensitive to annual variation in fecundity.

AB Numerous food supplementation experiments have tested the hypothesis that timing of reproduction in birds is limited by energy constraints. These studies have generally concluded that food availability is the primary proximate factor affecting the timing of nesting in birds. None of these studies, however, has examined the relationship between food availability and the timing of nesting in piscivorous birds. To determine whether food was the primary proximate factor affecting timing of nest initiation in the piscivorous Belted Kingfisher (Ceryle alcyon), we conducted a food supplementation experiment from 1993 through 1995; additional descriptive data were collected in 1992. Belted Kingfishers that nested early had heavier nestlings and were more likely to renest, in the event of nest failure, than were late-nesting birds. This indicates a reproductive advantage in early nesting. In 1994 and 1995, when we began the feeding treatment early in the prebreeding season (8 March) and provided enough fish to meet the estimated energy requirements of a pair of kingfishers (90 g/d), nests of supplemented birds were initiated earlier than those of unsupplemented birds as predicted by the energy constraint model. In 1993, when we began the feeding treatment later (20 April) and provided less fish (20-30 g/d), there was no difference in the initiation dates of supplemented and unsupplemented nests. Although these data support the primary prediction of the energy constraint model, two patterns in our data were not explained by this model. First, few unsupplemented nests were initiated early in the breeding season relative to an unmanipulated reference population. Second, no supplemented nests were initiated outside the range of nesting dates recorded in our unmanipulated reference population. Based on these patterns, we argue that variation in arrival time of females on the breeding grounds, coupled with their selection of territories based on food availability, offers a feasible and testable alternative to the energy constraint model. This habitat selection model predicts that food availability influences the location of reproduction of individuals, but does not alter the timing of their reproduction. A literature review revealed few data that could distinguish the energy constraint and habitat selection models. We think that it is important to consider the habitat selection alternative before concluding that the results of food supplementation studies support the energy constraint model. We suggest that future studies use spatial and temporal controls to partition variation in nest initiation dates into multiple causes (e.g., energy constraints, habitat selection).

AB Ecological theory for benthic communities emphasizes intense species interactions that depend on the high productivity of sedentary invertebrates. The keystone predator hypothesis maintains that intense predation by one consumer species is necessary to prevent a prolific, competitively dominant prey species from eliminating-other species using the same resource. This study considers the consequences of extreme spatial and temporal variation in the recruitment of a prey species supporting keystone and diffuse predation. Prior experiments on rocky shores of Santa Catalina Island, California, USA, demonstrated that predation by spiny lobsters (Panulirus interruptus) maintained a distinctive red algal turf by killing juvenile mussels (Mytilus californianus and M. galloprovincialis) that otherwise overgrow and replace the algae. In the present study, long-term surveys revealed that high recruitment of the predominant mussel, M. californianus occurred only on the most wave-exposed sites in certain years; mussel recruitment was slight to nil on relatively protected sites in most years. A predator exclosure experiment consisting of seven replicates placed along the gradient of wave exposure demonstrated that the effects of predation depended upon the spatial differences in recruitment rates. Lobsters on wave-exposed sites functioned as keystone predators; on more sheltered sites, little or no predation, whether by lobsters or the fishes and whelks also foraging on the sheltered sites, was necessary to maintain the algal assemblage. Similar species assemblages can be maintained by markedly different relative levels of crucial ecological rates. In the mid-intertidal zone of Santa Catalina Island, the intense species interactions depicted in the keystone predator hypothesis occurred only at productive, high wave exposure locations; low recruitment of mussels elsewhere preempts both predation and the competition between the mussel and algal assemblages. Thus, red algae dominates rocky shores through different mechanisms over a range of physical conditions. The occurrences of low mussel recruitment do not appear to be anomalies, but rather a consequence of the life history of Mytilus californianus.

AB There is much interest in assessing the relative importance of ''top-down'' (from the trophic level above) vs. ''bottom-up'' (from the trophic level below) effects in ecological communities. This study compares the strength of top-down effects of parasites and bottom-up effects of plants on herbivores.
   We established populations of sea-oxeye daisy, Borrichia frutescens, and gall-making flies, Asphondylia borrichiae, on 12 separate off-shore islands in Pinellas County, Florida (USA). High levels of parasitism were obtained by adding high densities of parasitized galls, and high levels of host-plant nitrogen were obtained by adding fertilizer. We established three replicates of each of the following treatments: low parasitism, low nitrogen; low parasitism, high nitrogen; high parasitism, low nitrogen; and high parasitism, high nitrogen.
   There was a significant interaction of parasitism and plant nitrogen: parasitism was important only on high-nitrogen plants where galls were abundant. Thus, our results contribute new insights into top-down vs. bottom-up effects: bottom-up forces set the stage on which top-down forces may act.

AB Population substructure and the effects of scale have recently received much theoretical attention, but few studies have examined these factors in free-living populations of vertebrates. We used > 200 000 sightings of recognized females recorded over a continuous 20-yr period to explore population substructure and spatial heterogeneity in red deer on the Isle of Rum, Scotland. We used hierarchical cluster analysis to group individuals together by their proximities in space, and we explored the influence of scale, considering scales ranging between the whole population and groups of one or two individuals. Intermediate scales were isolated as being the best at describing calf winter survival, the key factor in determining future population density. The most statistically explanatory scale isolated a population substructure related to vegetation, with higher local densities occurring around herb-rich Festuca-Agrostis grassland. Calves at high local density were most likely to die. Patterns of local population density varied between seasons in relation to food availability. High-resolution scales were the best descriptors of calf winter survival in summer; coarser scales were better in winter. In both summer and winter, local population density was more important than total population density in influencing calf winter survival. The effects on calf survival of local population density during the summer interacted significantly with calf sex and the mother's reproductive status. In this study, the technique of grouping animals by their proximity in space was more realistic and informative than discrete spatial divisions of the study area.

AB The effects of the herbivorous zooplankter, Daphnia, on a natural community of microzooplankton (rotifers, ciliates, and nanoflagellates) were compared in enclosures of two sizes (15 and 10 000 L) and in a eutrophic lake before and after a fish kill. The magnitude of Daphnia's effect on microzooplankton taxa varied quantitatively and qualitatively between experiments. The rotifer Synchaeta pectinata and the ciliate, Didinium sp., showed extreme differences between experiments, exhibiting opposite responses in small vs. large enclosures. The relative rankings of responses for two rotifers (Polyarthra dolichoptera and Synchaeta pectinata) and two ciliates (Coleps sp. and Didinium sp.) were reversed in small vs. large enclosures. Polyarthra was depressed by Daphnia more than Synchaeta in small enclosures, while Synchaeta was depressed more than Polyarthra in the large enclosures. Didinium was depressed more than Coleps in the small enclosures, while the reverse occurred in large enclosures.
   Microzooplankton responses also changed over time in the large-enclosure experiment. Daphnia significantly suppressed total ciliate dry biomass, but not total rotifer biomass after 6 d, but suppressed dry biomass of both groups by the end of the 23-d experiment. This result may reflect changes in the relative importance of Daphnia's predatory and competitive effects over time. Daphnia's effects on the rotifers, Polyarthra and Hexarthra mira, took 3 wk to be expressed but were very strong by the end of the large-enclosure experiment, suggesting that short-term experiments may underestimate competitive effects. Polyarthra's delayed response was associated with a delayed response of cryptophytes to the Daphnia manipulation.
   Comparisons of enclosure results with temporal correlations in lake data and with microzooplankton abundances before and after a fish kill indicated better congruence between lake data and the large-enclosure results. More importantly, large-enclosure results agreed more closely with whole-lake dynamics than with small-enclosure results. Consequently, large-scale enclosure experiments may provide reliable predictions of whole-lake phenomena, but small-scale (microcosm) experiments may not.

AB The spatial extent of the canopy or root system of a plant is often used as an index of its potential to acquire resources, such as water and nutrients. This has given rise to the area of influence (AOI) and neighborhood concepts for quantifying competitive interactions between neighboring plants. Both are based on a circle of fixed radius centered on a plant, which presupposes that two plants in close proximity are always strong competitors. There is evidence that this is not always the case. In this paper, we present a simple model of plant population dynamics that extends the concept of AOI by considering ''compensatory'' growth of root systems. The ability of a plant to grow roots into soil zones free of neighbors in response to competitive pressures is expressed by the value of a single parameter, lambda. Effects on population attributes resulting from competition in plants with compensatory growth are compared with populations with noncompensatory growth.
   Simulations show that compensatory plants are better able to utilize available space, have greater biomass, and outcompete noncompensatory plants. The change from a clumped to a regular distribution of individuals due to density-dependent mortality is delayed in noncompensatory plants. These theoretical results suggest that growth plasticity and the resulting asymmetry in space acquisition may play an important role in plant population dynamics.

AB Tree seedling establishment and growth were studied in experimental canopy gaps to assess the effect of heterogeneity of regeneration microsites within and among gaps in mature conifer forests. Seedlings were studied for two years in closed-canopy areas and in recently created gaps ranging in size from 40 to 2000 m(2) in four stands of mature (90-140 yr) and old-growth (>400 yr) Douglas-fir forest in the western Cascade Range of central Oregon and southern Washington, USA. We examined the relative importance of substrate type, shade from logs and shade cloth, density of understory vegetation, gap size, and forest age on the success of Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). Seedlings originating from seed sown on experimental microsites were compared with seedlings regenerating naturally on a range of microsites.
   Seedling establishment was greater on decayed wood than on forest floor or mineral soil in closed-canopy areas, particularly for Tsuga. Differences in establishment among substrates declined with increasing gap size, although establishment on the forest floor tended to be low in portions of large gaps exposed to direct solar radiation. In exposed areas, shade from woody debris and shade cloth facilitated establishment for all species, while shade from understory vegetation aided the establishment of Pseudotsuga but not that of Tsuga. Establishment in shaded portions of gaps declined with vegetation and shade-cloth cover. Seedling size increased with gap size, decreased with level of shade, and tended to be greatest on forest floor and lowest on decayed wood.
   Establishment and growth of the different species was related to differences in seed mass and tolerance of environmental extremes. Heterogeneity at the seedling scale (<10 cm) often overrode larger-scale environmental gradients (>2 m) associated with gap size and within-gap position. Thus the gap partitioning hypothesis, which emphasizes gap size and within-gap position, may be too simple to account for the role of microsite heterogeneity and species' regeneration traits on the development of mature forests.

AB The four different assemblages of marsupial dasyuroid carnivores in Australia, comprising four species on the island of Tasmania and three different two-species assemblages on the mainland of Australia, present an ideal opportunity to test the theories of competitively based morphological character displacement. With males and females treated as separate morphospecies, four trophic characters that relate to killing and feeding behavior and skull length, as a measure of body size, were examined for evidence of morphological patterning, latitudinal size variation, and sexual dimorphism. The competitive basis for character displacement in intra- and interspecific variation in prey size was sought from dietary analysis at a field site.
   Even spacing in canine strength, but not in other characters, was found among species and sexes of quells (Dasyurus viverrinus and D. maculatus), but not including the devil (Sarcophilus laniarius) or the thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus), in Tasmania. Even spacing was found in temporalis muscle size for all combinations of the four Tasmanian species. Canine breaking strength and muscle strength driving the canines can be construed as the most important trophic characters involved in prey capture, and therefore in determining the upper size of prey that can be handled. Even spacing was found in Tasmania, where there are two larger species in the guild, but not in any of the three mainland assemblages where the larger species of carnivores have been absent for many generations. The basis for the observed morphological patterning in killing behavior, evidence for even spacing in prey size, and partial character release on the mainland are consistent with the hypothesis of competitive character displacement.
   These size relationships result from a complex interplay of factors. Latitudinally correlated size variation has influenced an increase in body size and canine strength in D. viverrinus and an increase in body size in D. maculatus in Tasmania. This is countered by decreased canine strength in D. maculatus in Tasmania resulting from competitive character displacement. The result is character convergence. Sexual selection also influences size relationships.

AB Interactions among organisms take place within a complex milieu of abiotic and biotic processes, but we generally study them as solitary phenomena. Complex combinations of negative and positive interactions have been identified in a number of plant communities. The importance of these two processes in structuring plant communities can best be understood by comparing them along gradients of abiotic stress, consumer pressure, and among different life stages, sizes, and densities of the interacting species. Here, we discuss the roles of life stage, physiology, indirect interactions, and the physical environment on the balance of competition and facilitation in plant communities.

Variations in delta(13)C and delta(15)N values within a fish population are often small as a result of feeding on the same food source. We report here, however, strikingly broad ranges of delta(13)C (-25.9 to -9.5 parts per thousand) and delta(15)N (5.8 to 14.4 parts per thousand) in an exotic fish from a Florida lake. Together with isotope data for food sources and gut contents, we demonstrate significant diet variation within a population of blue tilapia.

We set out to determine if daily larval cohorts of the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides differ in mean physiological quality and, therefore, in their potential for recruiting to adult populations. To assess larval physiological quality, we measured the organic content of nonfeeding cyprid larvae attaching on five dates (10-15 d intervals) during the 1995 recruitment season. Juvenile physiological quality was determined by monitoring the growth, under controlled laboratory conditions, of individuals attaching on seven dates (3-15 d intervals) during the same season. Both cyprid organic content and juvenile growth capacity differed significantly among daily cohorts. We suggest that variation in cyprid organic content may explain previous observations of temporal variation in cyprid metamorphic success and early juvenile mortality and further suggest that variation in juvenile growth capacity contributes to differences in recruitment success of daily cohorts.

AB Longitudinal studies of survival are valuable because age-specific survival affects population dynamics and the evolution of several life history traits. We used capture-mark-recapture models to assess the relationship between survival and sex, age, population, year of study, disease, winter weather, and population density in two populations of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) in Alberta, Canada. The Ram Mountain population, monitored for 20 yr, more than doubled in density; the Sheep River population, monitored for 13 yr, experienced a pneumonia epizootic. Yearling survival varied among years and was lower than that of older sheep of the same sex, except for yearling males at Ram Mountain. Yearling females at Ram Mountain were the only sex-age class exhibiting density dependence in survival. Senescence was evident for both sexes in both populations. Female survival from age 2 to age 7 was very high in both populations, but males aged 2 and 3 yr enjoyed better survival than males aged 4-6 yr. Our data support the suggestion that where hunters remove many males older than 5 yr of age, the natural mortality of males increases at 3-5 yr, possibly because young males suffer a mortality cost of participating in rutting activity. The decline in survival for sheep older than 7 yr was greater for males than for females. Survival was lower for males than for females, both among prime-aged sheep (0.896 vs. 0.939 at Sheep River; 0.837 vs. 0.945 at Ram Mountain) and among older sheep (0.777 vs. 0.859 at Sheep River; 0.624 vs. 0.850 at Ram Mountain), but not among yearlings. Survival of sheep aged 2-7 yr was not significantly different between the two populations. Winter weather did not affect survival. Survival of sheep 2 yr of age and older did not vary significantly between years, except at Sheep River where survival of prime-aged sheep of both sexes was lower in the year of the pneumonia epizootic. Studies of survival of mountain sheep based upon skull collections may have overestimated survival of young rams. Our results underline the need for accurate information on age-specific survival.

AB Juvenile weakfish (Cynoscion regalis) prey heavily on mysids (Neomysis americana) and sevenspine bay shrimp (Crangon septemspinosa) during estuarine residency. Previous researchers have suggested that Neomysis are superior prey because the growth rate and condition factor of juvenile weakfish in Delaware Bay are positively associated with the proportion of Neomysis in the diet. Laboratory experiments were conducted to (I) examine prey preferences of juvenile weakfish foraging on Neomysis and Crangon; (2) determine whether selective predation leads to short- and long-term energy maximization; and (3) identify pre- and postconsumptive factors that influence relative prey profitability and potentially constrain weakfish foraging success and growth.
   Weakfish preyed selectively on Neomysis over a range of relative prey abundances, including trials where available Crangon biomass was approximate to 20 times greater than Neomysis biomass. Preconsumptive cost:benefit analyses based on prey energy content (E), prey biomass (M), and predator handling times (H-t) failed to predict prey selection by juvenile weakfish. These analyses indicated that fish should select Crangon over Neomysis to maximize gross E/H-t and M/H-t. The inadequacy of E/H-t and M/H-t as measures of prey profitability was revealed through consideration of postconsumptive processes. In particular, Neomysis were digested and evacuated from the stomach 1.8 times faster than Crangon. The hypothesis that differential prey digestibility influenced prey profitability was tested by comparing long-term energy intake rate and growth rate of weakfish foraging ad libitum on Neomysis vs. Crangon. Mean daily energy intake and growth rate were significantly higher for fish foraging on Neomysis, providing evidence that selective predation on Neomysis functioned as a rate-maximizing strategy. Differences in long-term energy intake were similar in magnitude to differences in gastric evacuation rate, indicating that the higher preconsumptive value of Crangon (measured as E/H-t and M/H-t) was nullified by a slower rate of digestion. Our findings demonstrate that currencies used ta test optimal diet predictions of prey choice in fishes must incorporate postconsumptive processes that potentially constrain long-term energy intake rate and growth.

AB Physical ecosystem engineers are organisms that directly or indirectly control the availability of resources to other organisms by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials. Physical ecosystem engineering by organisms is the physical modification, maintenance, or creation of habitats. Ecological effects of engineers on many other species occur in virtually all ecosystems because the physical state changes directly create nonfood resources such as living space, directly control abiotic resources, and indirectly modulate abiotic forces that, in turn, affect resource use by other organisms. Trophic interactions and resource competition do not constitute engineering. Engineering can have significant or trivial effects on other species, may involve the physical structure of an organism (like a tree) or structures made by an organism (like a beaver dam), and can, but does not invariably, have feedback effects on the engineer. We argue that engineering has both negative and positive effects on species richness and abundances at small scales, but the net effects are probably positive at larger scales encompassing engineered and nonengineered environments in ecological and evolutionary space and time. Models of the population dynamics of engineers suggest that the engineer/habitat equilibrium is often, but not always, locally stable and may show long-term cycles, with potential ramifications for community and ecosystem stability. As yet, data adequate to parameterize such a model do not exist for any engineer species. Because engineers control flows of energy and materials but do not have to participate in these flows, energy, mass, and stoichiometry do not appear to be useful in predicting which engineers will have big effects. Empirical observations suggest some potential generalizations about which species will be important engineers in which ecosystems. We point out some of the obvious, and not so obvious, ways in which engineering and trophic relations interact, and we call for greater research on physical ecosystem engineers, their impacts, and their interface with trophic relations.

AB The question of what, if anything, limits the length of food chains has been problematic ever since Elton originally asked it decades ago. Here, we reexamine the major evidence for one of the chief hypotheses: dynamical constraints. Reportedly, food chain stability decreases as chain length increases. However, the separate roles of self-damping (where a species shows density dependence independent of the densities of other species in the food chain model) and chain length have not been adequately determined. We examined food webs of varying chain length while controlling for self-damping. In contrast to the prevailing hypothesis, we find a weak but significant increase in stability in longer chains when we hold constant the number of species and the number of self-damping terms. Thus, the conclusion that longer food chains are more dynamically fragile, thereby setting an upper limit to food chain length, has at best very limited theoretical support. Our results indicate that community stability should tend to lengthen, not shorten, food chains. Mechanisms limiting the length of food chains remain to be convincingly demonstrated.

AB A more systematic approach to conservation biology would be desirable for several reasons. It would reduce the biases that can arise from overlooking potentially important factors in conservation applications; it could help to clarify important definitions; and it could help to relate apparently disparate studies. We suggest that models adopted from the familiar models of analysis of variance (ANOVA) can provide such an approach and serve these purposes.
   We present such a model. Its terms provide a checklist that could be used to assess the completeness of databases, management plans, and theoretical models. Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) conservation is discussed as an example of the usage of this model as a checklist.
   The model presented here can also be used to clarify the definitions of some important concepts, especially the definitions of demographic stochasticity and environmental stochasticity, which different authors have sometimes used differently. This model provides a way of clarifying and communicating whatever definition an author may choose to use.
   Finally, we suggest that the model we present, or similar models also based upon ANOVA models, can be used to relate theoretical models to each other, and to empirical studies, by identifying the types of variation that are present or absent in each.

AB The classical test for habitat saturation and the existence of floaters in birds involves removing territorial individuals and documenting whether replacement occurs. In most experiments with birds, only males are removed. An alternative explanation for the observed reoccupation of vacant territories by males is that they are attracted by the presence of unmated (widowed) females, and not necessarily by availability of habitat. We performed experiments with a migratory passerine bird, the Black-throated Blue Warbler (Dendroica caerulescens), at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, in which we removed (1) only males, (2) only females, and (3) both males and females from breeding territories. In all cases when only males were removed, new or neighboring males colonized the vacant territory, whereas when both sexes were removed only one of nine territories was reoccupied; when females were removed, there was no replacement. Our results suggest the importance of considering female availability, in addition to habitat availability, in studies of habitat distributions and population dynamics of birds and other species.

AB Apparent associations between flower color and type of pollinator might be explained by correlations between color and other floral traits, rather than by narrow pollinator preferences for color. To explore this possibility, we obtained flowers varying naturally in color, nectar reward, and morphology, from a hybrid zone between Ipomopsis aggregata and I. tenuituba in western Colorado, United States. We used aviary and held experiments to study preferences of hummingbirds for unmanipulated flowers and for flowers in which we experimentally dissociated color from nectar reward and morphology. Hummingbirds preferred red flowers of I. aggregata, which contain superior nectar rewards and have relatively broad corolla tubes, relative to flowers of I. tenuituba, which are white, contain small nectar rewards, and have narrow tubes. There was no evidence of flower constancy. When presented with flowers differing only in color, birds showed a spontaneous preference for red. However, this preference could be reversed by making white flowers more rewarding than red. When plants of both parental species and their hybrids were placed in an array in the field, with all flowers painted red, hummingbirds preferred to visit the more rewarding, wider tubed I. aggregata. These results suggest that pollinator-mediated selection could act on color, shape, and nectar separately. Experimental manipulations that dissociate these traits are essential to distinguish direct from correlated selection. Also, hummingbird selection favoring red flowers may result from past experience and, thus, may depend on the ecological context.

AB To explore the interactive effect of physical dimension and nutrient conditions on primary productivity, experimental planktonic-benthic ecosystems were initiated in different-sized cylindrical containers scaled in two ways. One series of experimental ecosystems was scaled for a constant depth (1.0 m) as volume was increased from 0.1 to 1.0 to 10 m(3). The other series was scaled for a constant shape (radius/depth = 0.56) across an identical range of volumes. Triplicate systems of each size and shape were housed in a temperature-controlled room illuminated with fluorescent and incandescent lights, and mixed by means of large, slow-moving impellers. All experimental ecosystems received an exchange of filtered estuarine water (10%/d). Nutrient concentrations, and ecosystem primary productivity and respiration, were traced over time during spring, summer, and fall experiments. During the nutrient-rich spring experiment, systems in the constant-shape series exhibited similar gross primary productivity (GPP) when rates were expressed per unit area or per unit Light energy received. When productivity was expressed per unit volume, however, rates declined as the depth of the containers increased. We interpret this dimensional pattern of GPP in the spring experiment as a reflection of light limitation. During the summer experiment, when nutrient concentrations were low, GPP was constant per unit volume, and it increased with increasing depth when expressed per unit area, This reversed dimensional pattern is consistent with expectations under nutrient-limited conditions. Indeed, GPP increased and the scaling pattern returned to that observed in the spring experiment when we added nutrients to the containers. During the fall experiment, nutrient concentrations were intermediate between spring and summer, and the dimensional pattern of GPP exhibited characteristics of both light and nutrient limitation. Differences in productivity in the constant-depth series were less extreme and can be attributed to artifacts of enclosure, such as differences in light attenuation and differences in the ratio of wall area to the unit volume of the containers. Understanding both fundamental scaling effects and artifacts of enclosure is key to the comparative analysis of processes among ecosystems, and to extrapolating results from experimental to natural ecosystems.

AB As an example of the relative impact of a specific ambient parameter on intraspecific phenotypic differentiation, the contribution of environmental sources of calcium on the geographic variation between alpine populations of the freshwater crustacean Gammarus fossarum was investigated through a comparative analysis of six different populations in the torrents of the Grenoble region of France.
   Major differences in water calcium levels were observed in correlation with lithological differences (average 13.6 mg/L in the crystalline massif of the Belledonne and 83.4 mg/L in the limestone areas of the Chartreuse and Vercors). The comparative analysis of the populations was performed through field and laboratory experimentation at morphometrical and ecophysiological levels. Uniform samples of male adult specimens from six different sites (two sites in the Belledonne, two sites in the Chartreuse, and two sites in the Vercors) were compared using three easily measurable parameters: maximum dry mass, duration of the molt cycle, and calcium balance during the molt cycle.
   Animals from waters that flow over limestone show a larger maximum size and a longer molt cycle than those from waters that flow over crystalline rocks. Spectrophotometrical analysis of their calcium balance during the molt cycle reveals that, whereas all animals are equally calcified during the intermolt, the decalcification during the premolt and the recalcification during the postmolt are more rapid in animals from limestone areas than in those from crystalline sites. Translocation experiments in both natural and artificially calcium-enriched waters confirm these differences. A significant increase in the duration of the molt cycle was observed in animals translocated to water of lower calcium concentration and vice versa, whereas no significant difference was observed between controls and animals translocated into water of comparable calcium concentration. Current results, supported by such a new synthetic experimental approach, indicate that variations in water calcium levels may generate important ecophysiological differentiation between populations, which may suggest a possible influence of environmental calcium on the geographic distribution of Gammarus fossarum.

AB Facultative diapause is a strategy that allows insects to initiate an additional generation when conditions are favorable, or to enter diapause when they are not. The occurrence of additional generations within one year can have a profound effect on the ecology and evolution of a species. Most previous studies of the cues that induce facultative diapause in insects have concentrated on photoperiod and temperature. In contrast, we studied the effects of host-plant quality on the induction of larval diapause and subsequent voltinism in a poryphagous insect herbivore, Choristoneura rosaceana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). Field experiments demonstrated that the proportion of larvae entering diapause differed among four host-plant species. Larvae feeding on chokecherry were more likely to continue development and produce a second generation than larvae feeding on red maple or black ash. Paper birch was intermediate in diapause induction. Laboratory experiments with excised foliage supported the results of the field experiments and demonstrated that the induction of diapause depended on host species under constant conditions of photoperiod and temperature. A further study with low- and high-quality artificial diet demonstrated that the nutritional quality of larval diet has a direct effect on diapause induction: low-quality diet favored diapause induction. Dispersal of neonate larvae from host foliage did not necessarily reflect host quality and the potential for bivoltinism. We argue that the effect of plant quality on diapause induction in natural populations of insect herbivores merits more attention.

AB A long-term study of marked individuals in a numerically stable Sparrowhawk breeding population enabled the reproductive and survival rates of females of different ages to be calculated. These estimates were then used to calculate reproductive value, the mean number of young produced by females of different ages during the rest of their lives. The data provided evidence, not only for improvement in survival and breeding success in the early years of life, but also for senescence, i.e., a deterioration in survival and breeding success later in life. Average annual survival increased from 0.49 in Ist-yr females to 0.66 in 4 yr olds, and declined to 0.28 in 9 yr olds (maximum life-span 10 yr). Average annual production of young increased from 0.3 in Ist-yr females (including nonbreeders) to 3.3 in 5 yr olds, and declined to 1.8 in 9 yr olds. Mean reproductive value increased from 3.1 in Ist-yr females (including nonbreeders) to 8.1 in 4 yr olds, and declined to 2.1 in 9 yr olds.

AB We tested two sets of hypotheses about the role of secondary metabolites (glycoalkaloids) in ripe Solanum (Solanaceae) fruit. The Directed Toxicity Hypothesis states that these compounds are most toxic to frugivores that do not disperse seeds (e.g., fungi), whereas its alternative, the General Toxicity Hypothesis, states that they are generally toxic to all frugivores. The Removal Rate Hypothesis states that highly rewarding fruits, which are removed rapidly by dispersers, require only low levels of glycoalkaloids for protection against insects and microbes. The alternative Nutrient-Toxin Titration hypothesis states that highly rewarding fruits may be able to maintain higher levels of glycoalkaloids because high nutrient content may offset the negative effects of glycoalkaloids on dispersers. Our previous work with vertebrate frugivores supported the General Toxicity and Removal Rate hypotheses.
   We used artificial fruit pulp media to measure how the mycelial growth rate of nine fungal species was affected by two glycoalkaloids, alpha-solasonine and alpha-solamargine, both common in ripe Solanum fruits. In one set of fungal growth trials, we mimicked two species of fruit, S. americanum with low levels of glycoalkaloid in ripe fruit and S. carolinense with high levels, to determine the relative effects of nutrient and toxin content. In another set of trials, we examined the relative and interactive effects of the two glycoalkaloids. Finally, we tested whether or not increases in nutrient content could offset the negative effects of glycoalkaloids on fungal growth.
   All fungi tested were inhibited by the glycoalkaloids, with lower levels of antifungal activity for agars corresponding to (low-toxin) S. americanum fruits than to (high-toxin) S. carolinense fruits. Because fungi varied in their degree of inhibition by glycoalkaloids, we found only limited support for the Directed Toxicity Hypothesis. The degree of inhibition for fungi was, on average, similar in magnitude to the negative effects upon vertebrate feeding rates, providing further support for the General Toxicity Hypothesis. Additionally, we found no evidence for differences in antifungal effects between the two glycoalkaloids and no evidence of synergism between them. Nutrient effects were generally small, with little evidence that nutrient variation could compensate for the antifungal activity produced by levels of glycoalkaloids found in ripe S. carolinense fruits. Fruits that are presumably more profitable (S. americanum) are preferred by vertebrate frugivores and contain much lower levels of glycoalkaloid. These results support the Removal Rate Hypothesis. We conclude that glycoalkaloids of Solanum fruits may act as effective antifungal defenses. However, because they are also toxic to seed-dispersing vertebrates, their effects upon fruit-disperser interactions are probably general and important.

AB Models for organisms with complex life cycles predict decreased size at, and altered time to, metamorphosis for organisms experiencing greater mortality rate during the larval stages. We tested this prediction by exposing larvae of the tree hole mosquito, Aedes triseriatus, to predation by the mosquito Toxorhynchites rutilus in a series of five experiments. Populations both sympatric and allopatric to the predator were tested, and meta-analysis was used to synthesize the results of all experiments, and to test for heterogeneity of effects of actual vs. perceived predation (predator unable to kill prey). In the presence of this predator, A. triseriatus from both sympatric and allopatric populations had lower mass at pupation, as predicted. This effect was present in both sexes, but was more pronounced in females. The presence of the predator also increased time to pupation for females (but not for males). Reduced size at pupation appears to result from decreased growth rate in the presence of the predator, and we tested the hypothesis that this predator induced behavioral changes in A. triseriatus that lead to reduced growth (e.g., reduced movement and foraging) Behavioral observations did not support the hypothesis of be- havioral change. Meta-analysis revealed significant heterogeneity of the effects of actual predation vs. perceived predation on size at pupation, which decreased significantly only in response to actual predation. There was no significant heterogeneity in the effect of actual predation vs. perceived predation on time to pupation. These results suggest that effects of this predator on metamorphosis of A. triseriatus may be products of either facultative responses to the predator or of selective mortality due to predation in experiments with actual predation. Sympatric and allopatric populations of A. triseriatus used in these experiments did not differ consistently in size at and time to pupation, nor in their developmental responses to T. rutilus. Although these results generally support the predictions of existing models of complex life cycles, they suggest that the mechanisms producing these effects in this system may not be the same as the behavioral mechanisms producing similar effects in amphibian systems.

AB Exploration may play a crucial role in habitat choice by larvae of benthic organisms. Experiments testing exploratory behavior of larvae in flow were conducted with cyphonautes larvae of the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea. The response of the larvae to two flow parameters-flow direction and shear (i.e., velocity)-was examined by using two different substratum morphologies (flat plate and cylinder), which induce distinct flow patterns. Settling cyphonautes larvae possess a mechanism of locomotion, in addition to swimming, which may facilitate exploration in flow conditions that otherwise would sweep the larvae away. The results show that cyphonautes larvae are able to explore substrata in all directions in flow velocities that are much faster than their locomotion speeds, and that their preferential motion is upstream. This behavior has been largely ignored to date despite its potential ecological importance. For instance, upstream exploration may enable larvae to locate specific, obligatory settlement sites by tracking waterborne chemicals to their sources.

AB Increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 will interact with other environmental factors to influence the physiology and ecology of trees. This research evaluated how plant phytochemical responses to enriched atmospheric CO2 are affected by the availability of soil nitrate (NO3-) and how these chemical changes, in turn, alter the performance of a tree-feeding folivore. Seedlings of three deciduous tree species-quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), red oak (Quercus rubra), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum)-were grown in ambient (355 mu L/L) or elevated (650 mu L/L) CO2 in combination with low (1.25 mmol/L) or high (7.5 mmol/L) soil NO3- availability. After 60 d, foliage was analysed for changes in nutrients and allelochemicals likely to be influenced by the availability of CO2 and NO3-. Penultimate gypsy moth larvae (Lymantria dispar) were reared on foliage (aspen and maple) to determine how performance would be affected by host chemical changes.
   Using the framework of carbon-nutrient balance (CNB) theory, we tested three hypotheses regarding the impact of CO2 and NO3- availability on plant chemistry and insect performance: (1) nitrogen-based compounds will decrease, and carbon-based compounds will increase in response to elevated CO2 and/or low NO3-; (2) aspen will exhibit the greatest change in C:N ratios, and maple the least; and (3) phytochemical changes will influence gypsy moth performance, with larvae fed aspen being affected more than those fed maple.
   Concentrations of nitrogen and soluble protein decreased, whereas concentrations of starch, condensed tannins, and ellagitannins increased, in response to elevated CO2 and/or low NO3-. Responses of simple carbohydrates and phenolic glycosides were variable, however, suggesting that foliar accumulations of ''dynamic metabolites'' do not follow the predictions of CNB theory as well as do those of stable end products. With respect to Hypothesis 2, we found that absolute (net) changes in foliar C:N ratios were greatest for aspen and least for oak, whereas relative (proportional) changes were greatest for maple and least for aspen. Thus, Hypothesis 2 was only partially supported by the data. Considering Hypothesis 3, we found that elevated CO2 treatments had little effect on gypsy moth development time, growth rate, or larval mass. Larvae reared on aspen foliage grown under elevated CO2 exhibited increased consumption but decreased conversion efficiencies. Gypsy moth responses to NO3- were strongly host specific: the highest consumption and food digestibility occurred in larvae on high-NO3- aspen, whereas the fastest growth rates occurred in larvae on high-NO3- maple. In short, our results again only partially supported the predicted pattern, They indicate, however, that the magnitude of insect response elicited by resource-mediated shifts in host chemistry will depend on how levels of compounds with specific importance to insect fitness (e.g., phenolic glycosides in aspen) are affected.
   Overall, we observed relatively few true interactions (i.e,, nonadditive) between carbon and nitrogen availability vis a vis foliar chemistry and insect performance. Tree species, however, frequently interacted with CO2 and/or NO3- availability to affect both sets of parameters. These results suggest that the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on terrestrial plant communities will not be homogeneous, but will depend on species composition and soil nutrient availability.

AB Local population densities of most benthic marine organisms are determined by a variety of processes that act before, during, and after settlement of planktonic propagules to the benthos. Considerable disagreement exists over the relative contribution of each process to patterns of abundance. Using multifactorial experiments, I assessed the effects of resident conspecifics, potential interspecific competitors, predators, and reef location on patterns of recruitment of two temperate reef fishes.
   Recruitment of bluebanded gobies (Lythrypnus dalli) and blackeye gobies (Coryphopterus nicholsii) consistently increased with distance from a nearby large reef. Recruitment of Lythrypnus was enhanced by the presence of older resident conspecifics. I found no strong evidence of any competitive effects between the two species. Predators had a variety of important effects on the density of recruits. Recruitment of Lythrypnus was halved by predators; this was the result of direct and indirect effects of predators: in addition to directly reducing recruit density, predators also reduced recruitment indirectly by reducing the density of older residents to which recruits responded. I developed two related methods for quantifying the contributions of the direct and indirect components of the predator effect. The effect of predation was spatially variable for both species: the net effect of this variability was the elimination of recruitment patterns related to reef location. Hence, the effects of spatially variable input of recruits was dependent upon the presence of predators, and thereby, predation altered the relative importance of the other factors that affected recruitment of the gobies. I argue that a much broader understanding of the ''relative importance'' of multiple causal processes will be gained by striving to understand how the contribution of each process is modified by other processes than by attempting to quantify the ''importance'' of each process.

AB In lakes, top predators (fish) often influence the abundance of primary producers (phytoplankton) through food web interactions: phytoplankton biomass is often greater when planktivorous fish are abundant than when they are rare, and phytoplankton community structure is often affected by fish. Three mechanisms can account for these ''top-down'' effects of fish: decreased herbivory by zooplankton when fish biomass is high; modification of nutrient recycling rates by the herbivorous zooplankton assemblage as fish biomass varies; and nutrient recycling by fish. These processes were experimentally separated and their relative importance quantified in Tuesday Lake, Michigan. This was accomplished by manipulating the abundance of planktivorous fish or zooplankton in enclosures containing natural phytoplankton communities, and by incubating phytoplankton in nutrient-permeable chambers (which excluded herbivores) placed inside these enclosures.
   In large enclosures with all trophic levels, several phytoplankton taxa and total phytoplankton biomass showed increased abundance in the presence of fish compared to enclosures without fish. Several taxa also showed significantly greater abundance in nutrient-permeable chambers incubated in enclosures with fish than in chambers incubated in enclosures without fish. The latter result indicates that some phytoplankton taxa respond to fish even when separated from direct herbivory but exposed to nutrients recycled by consumers, Thus, consumer-mediated nutrient recycling had strong effects on phytoplankton community dynamics and could partly explain the ''top-down'' effects of fish. Most phytoplankton taxa responded to consumer-mediated nutrient recycling, especially dinoflagellates and chrysophytes.
   In separate enclosures, phytoplankton were exposed to contrasting zooplankton assemblages shaped by fish predation but without fish being present. The response of phytoplankton was not as strong as in the case of fish manipulations. Furthermore, the community-level response of phytoplankton was weaker in nutrient-permeable chambers placed in these enclosures than in chambers incubated in enclosures with fish. Nutrient limitation assays showed that manipulation of fish decreased phosphorus limitation of phytoplankton, while direct manipulation of zooplankton had no effect on phosphorus limitation.
   These results provide experimental evidence that food web effects on nutrient recycling are important in controlling phytoplankton community dynamics. Results also suggest that some of these effects are expressed via direct recycling of nutrients by fish, as well as by fish-induced effects on nutrient recycling by herbivores. Nutrient-mediated effects of top predators on primary producers should be incorporated into future models of ''top-down'' control of food web dynamics.

AB Intimate associations among individuals of three common species of Caribbean coral reef sponges can be mutually beneficial. Both growth rate and survival are enhanced when heterospecific sponges adhere to each other, as demonstrated by experiments in which sponges of the same size and genotype were grown (1) in intimate association with conspecific vs. heterospecific sponges, (2) alone vs. in intimate association with conspecific sponges, and (3) alone on the primary substratum vs. attached to an intact branch of a conspecific or heterospecific sponge. Natural development and long-term dynamics of these associations were observed in unmanipulated individuals and also modelled by an experiment in which branches were exchanged between neighboring sponges. The three species studied (lotrochota birotulata, Amphimedon rubens, and Aplysina fulva) share an erect branching growth form but differ in tissue and skeletal characteristics sufficiently that they are in different orders of the Class Demospongiae. Reflecting these differences, the species are demonstrated to differ from each other in their susceptibility to a variety of environmental hazards, including predation by angelfishes and trunkfishes, predation by starfish, smothering by sediment, breakage by storm waves, pulverization by storm waves, toppling by storm waves, fragment mortality, and pathogens. Although the mechanisms by which growth rate is enhanced by adhering to a heterospecific sponge are unknown, these sponges appear to be able to decrease their loss rate by adhering tightly to sponges of species that differ from them in chemistry, tissue density, and skeletal construction, thereby increasing survival of hazards to which they would succumb when growing alone.

AB Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in grassland ecosystems is positively related to mean annual precipitation (MAP). However, at any given level of precipitation, other factors may effect ANPP. Our objective was to determine the importance of temperature and soil texture in explaining ANPP in the Great Plains of the United States. We constructed a spatial database of ANPP, climate, and soil texture for the region using a geographic information system. Holding MAP constant at 5-cm intervals, we related ANPP to mean annual temperature (MAT), and soil sand and clay contents.
   Our findings indicate that MAT and soil texture are important variables for explaining patterns of ANPP, after accounting for the variability explained by MAP. There is a negative relationship between temperature and ANPP when MAP is held constant; this has important climate-change implications. Results revealed an MAP crossover point for the inverse texture effect at similar to 80 cm of rainfall, much higher than previously reported. The consequences of this are substantial for grasslands throughout the globe, where precipitation ranges between 25 and 100 cm.

AB A variety of hypotheses have been proposed regarding the processes that regulate survival of the planktonic life history stages of marine organisms. Several of these hypotheses have been grouped under a general, ''growth-mortality'' hypothesis, which postulates that larger (a ''bigger-is-better'' mechanism), faster growing (a ''growth-rate'' mechanism), and faster developing (a ''stage-duration'' mechanism) individuals have a higher probability of survival. Using the otolith record of age, size, and ontogeny, these three mechanisms of the ''growth-mortality'' hypothesis were tested for the larval and pelagic juvenile stages of bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix (Pisces: Pomatomidae), a moderate-sized, coastal, pelagic, marine fish. Individuals that were larger-at-age were found to have a higher probability of survival, supporting the ''bigger-is-better'' mechanism. Faster growing ing individuals were also found to have a higher probability of survival, agreeing with the prediction of the ''growth-rate'' mechanism. Equivocal evidence was found with regard to the ''stage-duration'' mechanism. These results suggest that in pelagic ecosystems, larger and faster growing larvae have a higher probability of survival. Given the observed directional selection acting on larval size and growth, several potential mechanisms that maintain variable larval size and growth are addressed. Finally, the growth-related processes examined in this study are discussed in the context of the physical aspects of pelagic ecosystems that may also affect larval survival.

AB Although the establishment of new individuals in the breeding component of a population is an essential feature of population regulation, only a few attempts have been made to test biological hypotheses about recruitment. Most previous studies rely on ad hoc calculations or are flawed with unwarranted assumptions about survival. We use a recently developed approach, based on capture-mark-recapture, in which analysis of local recruitment is similar to a time-reversed analysis of survival. The basic data set consists of capture histories viewed in reverse order, with initial capture at year of birth, and subsequent observations corresponding to years when the animal has bred. The model considers two essential components, the probability for any breeding individual to reproduce for the first time (beta, the probability of first reproduction) and the probability of recapture (p), both conditional on survival. Contrary to previous attempts at modeling recruitment, the present approach does not assume an age at which breeding propensity stabilizes to a maximum value. The flexibility achieved allows the comparison of recruitment among groups within a population and also allows one to consider the effects of environmental variables, as well as interactions between such effects. Practically, the procedure starts from a global model, based upon the a priori knowledge of the biology of the species, and assesses its fit. Then more parsimonious models are selected using Akaike's Information Criterion and likelihood ratio tests. Finally, maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters are obtained with estimates of precision. We used a modified version of program RELEASE for goodness-of-fit tests, and program SURGE for iterative model fitting and the computation of likelihood ratio tests. We illustrate the method with the study of local recruitment of Greater Flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber resells) in the Camargue (southern France) between 1984 and 1994. We found additive effects of age and year to affect recruitment. Breeding propensity increased with age. Recruitment was noticeably higher in the year following an increase in mortality rate due to a particularly severe winter. Longlasting effects of this increased mortality on recruitment were observed in the three following years. There was no evidence for an effect of sex or cohort (year of birth) on recruitment. However, sex, as well as time and age, affected recapture rates. We discuss the various advantages and limitations of the model for the study of local recruitment in long-lived species and mention some potential developments.

AB I studied growth rate and reproduction in two geographically distinct strains of root voles, Microtus oeconomus, in the laboratory to unravel the mechanisms underlying the observed increase in body size from south to north among European microtine rodents. In the field, adult northern root voles are 51% heavier than southern. Many proximate and ultimate mechanisms underlying this geographic pattern have been suggested, but none has been adequately tested. I measured offspring growth rates in one northern and one southern strain over three consecutive laboratory generations, employing two separate experimental protocols (cross-mating and cross-fostering) to control for differential maternal investment. Paternal investment in the young was evaluated in separate tests. Northern root voles were larger at birth and grew faster than southern voles. Litter size and litter mass at birth were largest in the southern strain, when maternal body mass was adjusted for, indicating a larger prenatal reproductive expenditure in southern females. Cross-fostering and cross-breeding experiments demonstrated that the north-south difference in body mass is of genetic origin. Postnatal growth rate of cross-bred litters was intermediate between the two purebred strains, thus being consistent with an additive genetic mechanism. In contrast, neonatal mass of offspring from cross-bred pairs was similar to that of the southern strain, consistent with southern genetic dominance. Cross-fostering between the two strains showed that parental investment had no discernible effects on postnatal growth rate, although southern fathers showed more parental care than did northern fathers. Together, the cross-fostering and the cross-breeding experiments suggest that the growth rate of southern root voles was constrained by their own genotype and not by the characteristics of their mothers. Low environmental predictability in southern habitats and high productivity of northern habitats probably result in different selection pressures on growth rates and reproductive effort.

AB This study was motivated by an interest in herbivore-pollinator interactions, and in the potential of pollination ecology and the physical environment to influence levels of tolerance to herbivore damage in scarlet gilia, Ipomopsis aggregata. To investigate these potential interactions, we performed a factorial combination of clipping treatments, fertilizer additions, and hand pollinations in a natural population of scarlet gilia in 1994 and 1995. Clipping imposed the strongest treatment effect on plants and acted by delaying phenology, altering plant architecture, and reducing plant fitness in both years. Hand pollinations increased the production of fruits and seeds in 1995 only, suggesting that our population was pollen limited in that year. Clipped plants could compensate for damage, but only under a restrictive set of environmental conditions, including fertilizer and hand pollinations in 1994, and hand pollinations in 1995. We did not detect significant overcompensation in either year of study, even under conditions releasing plants from nutrient and pollen limitation. A phenotypic selection analysis was conducted in 1995 to investigate several traits thought to influence fitness in the presence and absence of herbivore damage. Clipped plants were under strong selection for early flowering and increased plant height. We did not detect a significant association between branch production or plant size and fitness in grazed plants, suggesting that other factors determined the ability of plants to compensate for damage in 1995. We suggest that clipping-induced changes in plant architecture and phenology altered interactions between damaged plants and pollinators. We offer several hypotheses to explain these patterns and highlight the complexity of pollinator-and herbivore-mediated selection in natural plant populations.

AB We present and illustrate methods of analyzing food web structure based on generalized linear models. Applied to the published food webs of Schoenly et al., these methods reveal strong associations of trophic fractions and connectance with the number of species in the web. Furthermore, the nature of these relationships depends on the habitat type of the web. Measures of goodness-of-fit of the statistical models reveal pronounced overdispersion, i.e., web-to-web variation in trophic fractions and connectance that greatly exceeds the variation attributable to the number of species and habitat type of the web. These results suggest it may be difficult to identify laws governing food web properties over a wide range of organisms and habitats.

AB Surface air temperature in arctic regions has increased since pre-industrial times, raising concerns that warmer and possibly drier conditions have increased soil decomposition rates, thereby stimulating the release to the atmosphere of the large stores of carbon (C) in arctic soils. We used a model (MEL-GEM, Marine Biological Laboratory General Ecosystem Model) of ecosystem C and nitrogen (N) dynamics to predict and analyze historical (1829-1990) changes in C storage in a N-limited, tussock-tundra ecosystem near Toolik Lake on the North Slope of Alaska. The model simulates stand-level photosynthesis and N uptake by plants, allocation of C and N to foliage, stems, and fine roots, respiration in these tissues, turnover of biomass through litterfall, and decomposition of litter and soil organic matter. We first calibrated the model by deriving a single parameter set that closely simulated the response of tussock tundra to decade-long experimental manipulations of nutrients, temperature, light, and atmospheric CO2.
   The calibrated model predicts that historical increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2 have increased total ecosystem C storage. Higher temperatures increased soil and plant respiration, but those losses of C were overcompensated by increased photosynthesis resulting from redistribution of N from soil to plants. This redistribution of N was due to increased net mineralization and uptake of N. Increases in atmospheric CO, also increased photosynthesis, but consequent increases in C storage were constrained by limits on increases in the C:N ratio of vegetation. In contrast, hypothesized historical decreases in soil moisture substantially decreased simulated total ecosystem C storage as a result of large increases in soil respiration. With decreased soil moisture, increases in photosynthesis associated with redistribution of N from soil to plants only partially compensated for respiratory C losses, as plant uptake of N could not keep pace with increased N mineralization rates. Consequent losses of N from the ecosystem contributed to the declines in C storage under drier conditions.
   Based on the combined effects of reconstructed historical changes in atmospheric CO2, mean growing-season temperature, and two alternative soil moisture scenarios, the model predicts a -5.4 to +2.3% change in ecosystem C from 1829 to 1990. These estimates are consistent with field evidence that historically recent changes in C storage of tussock tundra have been relatively small. However, the model also predicts that relatively large transient losses of ecosystem C (50-180 g.m(-2).yr(-1)) may frequently have occurred since the late 1800s, with one of the largest simulated C losses of the 20th century occurring from 1988 to 1990 (3-yr average = 133 g C.m(-2).yr(-1)). These simulated losses were similar to losses measured in tussock tundra at Toolik Lake from 1983 to 1990 (e.g., 1990 losses = 156 g Cm-2.yr(-1)) but nonetheless suggest that these measured losses may be transitory in nature.

AB Temperature and moisture have larger effects on litter decomposition than litter quality on regional scales. We tested whether this also holds for microclimatic differences between adjacent habitats. We placed litter of aspen (Populus tremuloides) and prairie grasses in both forest and prairie. Microclimate was varied by shading half the litter in both habitats. Litter was set out in May and retrieved after 4, 9, 16, and 21 wk. Decomposition rates averaged across sites and treatments were significantly lower for aspen (k = 0.44 yr(-1)) than grass litter (1.36 yr(-1)), reflecting differences in nitrogen (N) content between litter types (aspen, 0.62%; grass, 1.07%). Decomposition rates were highest in unshaded prairie, suggesting that shade may limit decomposition in forests. N mineralized from the litter was collected by ion-exchange resins placed under the litter, while uncovered resins collected mineral N deposited from the atmosphere. Less mineral N was collected by resins under litter than by uncovered resins, suggesting that litter accumulated mineral N deposited from the atmosphere. The N accumulation rates were significantly higher in aspen than grass litter, in accordance with a lower N concentration in aspen litter. Thus, on a local scale, decomposition rates and N dynamics were more strongly affected by litter quality than by shading or habitat.

AB Dispersal behaviors of organisms have been the subject of extensive ecological investigation at both the theoretical and experimental levels. One common framework for field studies of dispersal behavior that can be easily melded with theoretical work is the calculation of ''diffusion rates.'' Traditionally, this approach to studying dispersal has required (1) the tedious location of large numbers of individuals at a particular time or (2) actively tracking the movements of individuals. Here, I present a flux-based or ''boundary-oriented'' methodology that quantifies the passage of individuals into an absorbing boundary of known location at multiple points in time. This approach, which is the natural complement of existing methods, may make quantification of dispersal behavior more practical for time-strapped field researchers. Under the umbrella of the flux-based approach presented here, I use data from field experiments to determine the effect of initial density on dispersal rate for two sympatric species of praying mantids, species of generalist arthropod predators common in early successional fields. Unlike existing techniques, the methodology I outline here is specifically designed to handle dispersal data recorded from the two-dimensional, ''plot-oriented'' world of terrestrial ecology, facilitating the measurement of species-specific dispersal parameters that are necessary for meshing several important aspects of theoretical and experimental ecology.

AB Two species common to the temperate rain forests of New South Wales, Australia (Doryphora sassafras and Acmena smithii) were grown for 2 wk in either ambient (350 mu L/L) or elevated (700 mu L/L) CO2 concentrations and low light (30 mu mol photons . m(-2). s(-1)) after which the seedlings were exposed for over 9 wk to a midday 2-h highlight period (1250 mu mol photons . m(-2). s(-1), maximum) to simulate a tree fall gap. For both species, plants grown in elevated CO2 had greater biomass than plants grown in ambient CO2. However, relative increases in biomass were greater in Acmena, which is an early-successional species, than Doryphora, which is a late-successional species. Doryphora sassafras also had greater reductions in photosynthetic efficiency, as measured by chlorophyll fluorescence techniques (F-v/F-m) upon exposure to the high-light treatment than Acmena. Recovery in quantum efficiencies over time was observed for Doryphora, implying physiological acclimation to the new light environment. Plants grown in elevated CO2 had lower values of F-v/F-m than plants grown in ambient CO2, but these differences between CO2 treatments were only significant for the late-successional Doryphora. Although exposure to the simulated tree fall gap dramatically increased the conversion of pigments of the xanthophyll cycle, as well as increased the total pool size of xanthophyll cycle pigments relative to total chlorophyll concentration, there were no differences in either parameter between CO2 treatments. Leaves of Doryphora and those seedlings grown in elevated CO2 had greater starch concentrations than Acmena and those seedlings grown in ambient CO2, respectively. The reduction in quantum efficiencies for plants grown in elevated CO2 and exposed to a simulated tree fall gap is discussed in the context of the importance of gap phase regeneration for species in rain forest ecosystems and the potential effects of global change on those processes.

AB Although fungal fruiting bodies are a common food supplement for many forest animals and an important dietary staple for several small mammals, changes in their abundance and consumption with forest succession or disturbance have not been quantified. Above- and belowground fungal fruiting bodies (epigeous and hypogeous sporocarps) were sampled for 46 mo in managed-young, natural-mature, and old-growth western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) stands in Washington State. Screen exclosures were placed over the surface of half of the sample plots to prevent aboveground predation of sporocarps. Standing crop of epigeous sporocarps was low in most seasons and then increased 30-fold to a mean of 2.28 kg/ha in the fall. Epigeous biomass varied little between stand types, and animal consumption of these sporocarps was low. Standing crop of hypogeous sporocarps was 0.78 kg/ha in managed-young stands, compared to 4.51 and 4.02 kg/ha in natural-mature and old-growth stands. In all stands, standing crop peaked in the summer and was lowest in the winter. Mean animal consumption of hypogeous sporocarps was 0.64 kg/ha, a value that exceeded the available standing crop quantity of 0.36 kg/ha in managed-young stands during the winter. In natural-mature and old-growth stands, truffle biomass remained high year-round and exceeded consumption in all seasons. Low hypogeous sporocarp biomass in the managed-young stands resulted from the general absence of large clusters of Elaphomyces granulatus, which made up >90% of the biomass in older stands. This absence in managed-young stands may be associated with the thin organic layer that has developed following harvest and burning 60 yr ago. The consistent level of animal consumption indicates that truffles may be an important and readily available year-round food source, compared to the ephemeral fruiting of epigeous sporocarps. Changes in forest composition and age due to natural disturbance or human management influence fungal sporocarp productivity and diversity and, consequently, affect food availability for animals dependent on hypogeous sporocarps.

AB Natural disturbances produce openings in forest canopies. Gap opening and closure create a mosaic of regenerating phases in the forest, which are a source of environmental heterogeneity, contributing to the maintenance of community diversity. In this study we measured the rate of canopy closure using hemispherical photographs taken in the same points in August 1992, 1993, and 1994 at three temperate forests in Britain. We analyzed the change in percentage canopy openness in time and found that canopy closure occurred exponentially. These results were used to build a matrix model that incorporated canopy dynamics as a linear Markov-chain process of forest succession by classifying forest patches into types (according to percentage canopy openness) and calculating the probability of each patch type becoming the following patch type in one year's time. Standard matrix analysis allowed us to project forest structure (i.e., the proportion of patches of each type) at equilibrium, and to explore the effect of different disturbance rates on canopy dynamics. Simulations showed that higher disturbance rates result in a lower proportion of the forest under closed-canopy conditions, and that variation in disturbance rate has a dramatic effect on turnover rate. Forest dynamics studies could be based on a patch characterization system based on a quantitative scale of percentage canopy openness, which would make comparisons between forests possible.

AB We modeled the effect of heterogeneity in growing-season length on the diapause strategies of a partially bivoltine population of the striped ground cricket Allonemobius socius. First-generation females of this population can lay mixtures of direct-developing and diapause eggs, and bet-hedging theory predicts that in an unpredictably variable environment the proportion of diapause eggs laid will gradually increase over the season as the likelihood that a second generation will be able to complete development before winter decreases. We quantified variability in the thermal regime using long-term meteorological records, and constructed an analytical model using empirical components for growth and reproduction. The model predicted that females should switch to diapause egg production in early August, a finding that was corroborated by experimental and field observations. The form of the switch between egg types predicted by the model was a transition that spanned only a few days and was similar to that estimated from a laboratory experiment. Thus interannual variation in climate was not sufficient for the evolution of a marked bet-hedging response in the form of a gradual increase in the proportion of diapause eggs. However, we observed considerable variation among females in their diapause strategies that remains unexplained.

AB Nest predation may decrease the optimal clutch size for many reasons. In particular, a smaller clutch size may permit more investment in re-laying or in survival to the next reproductive event. The response to nest predation may be either genetic, as shown by comparative studies on birds, or phenotypic, as found in several aquatic species (invertebrates and fish). We have studied the effects of several years of high nest predation on clutch size variation in a Great Tit (Pants major) population. We tested whether nest predation was associated with selection on clutch size or with any phenotypic changes. In the year following peak nest predation, mean clutch size was reduced by about one egg. For nest predation, adult survival, and local recruitment, we failed to detect any dependence on clutch size; the reduction in clutch size was mostly phenotypic. Similarly, the return of clutch size to pre-predation values was explained as a phenotypic change. Surprisingly, individuals that did not experience nest predation themselves also modified their clutch size. This suggests that information on past predation persisted in the population for several years. In years with reduced clutch size, adult survival at the population level was higher, suggesting that a reduction in clutch size would be adaptive in case of nest predation, and that females adjusted their clutch size toward the optimum.

AB It has been hypothesized that periodically flooded forests have higher rates of aboveground net primary production than upland forests and near-continuously flooded forests, but a competing hypothesis holds that the benefits of periodic inputs of nutrients and water may be diminished by stresses associated with anaerobic soils or drought. To test these hypotheses, we measured groundwater table depths and aboveground productivity in floodplain forests of South Carolina and Louisiana. We established paired plots on locally dry, intermediate, and wet topographic positions across three hydrologic transects in each state. These plots encompassed upland hardwood, bottomland hardwood, and cypress swamp forests. Measurements of leaf litterfall, wood production, and groundwater table depth were made in 1987 and 1988. We then used mean growing-season water depth (MWD) to group the plots into three classes: wet (>0 cm), intermediate (0 to -60 cm), and dry (<-60 cm).
   Aboveground net primary production (NPP) on wet plots (2-yr mean +/- 1 SD = 675 +/- 271 g . m(-2). yr(-1)) was significantly lower than on intermediate and dry plots (P less than or equal to 0.02). There was no significant difference between intermediate and dry plots (107 +/- 189 and 1038 +/- 91) g . m(-2). yr(-1), respectively). In addition, aboveground NPP on intermediate plots was not significantly different from 22 temperate upland forests in the literature.
   Combining our data with data from the literature, we found that aboveground NPP on wet plots was negatively related to MWD with a slope of -5 g . m(-2). yr(-1). cm(-1). On sites with evidence of hydrologic disturbance (>25% dead stems) the slope of this line was 5 times greater (-24 g . m(-2). yr(-1). cm(-1)).
   We conclude that the subsidy-stress hypothesis does not adequately describe patterns of NPP across Southeastern U.S. floodplain forests. Conditions of periodic flooding and flowing water do not often lead to high rates of productivity compared with upland forests. However, extensive flooding is nearly always a significant stress on forest productivity, particularly when the flooding regime has been recently perturbed through levee construction or impoundment. Our data support a more complex interaction between subsidy and stress factors.

AB What factors permit the coexistence of competing species? In central Oklahoma, the predaceous ant lions Myrmeleon crudelis and M. immaculatus live in dense aggregations at the sheltered bases of cliff ledges. Three larval instars of each species act as predators and competitors of one another. In controlled field experiments, mortality of second and third instars increased with density, although intra-and interspecific effects were indistinguishable. The presence of third-instar larvae did not affect recruitment or survivorship of first-instar larvae. In all experiments, mortality was predictable on the basis of body mass and larval density, but not species identity. Increased food supply shortened development time and increased adult body mass but did not affect mortality. Larvae near the front of the ant lion aggregation grew faster due to greater food availability but suffered greater mortality in the pupal stage. Although food and space were limiting, neither species was excluded because (1) intra-and interspecific effects were similar; (2) third-instar larvae could not suppress the recruitment of first-instar larvae; and (3) recruitment was patchy in time and space. Oviposition behavior and interactions among adult ant lions may also contribute to larval coexistence.

AB Hydrodynamic forces generated by breaking waves have been proposed to act as one of the primary physical mechanisms constraining the sizes to which wave-swept intertidal plants can grow. Plants inhabiting intertidal areas are generally small relative to subtidal and terrestrial plants, and within a species, plants on wave-exposed shores are usually smaller than those at wave-protected sites. However, although these relationships have been well documented, there have been no manipulative field experiments demonstrating that wave forces are directly responsible for limiting plant sizes.
   In this study, I examined the effects of wave forces on plant sizes in the field by reciprocally transplanting Fucus gardneri (rockweed) individuals between wave-exposed and wave-protected intertidal sites at Fogarty Creek Point, Oregon. Mean sizes of wave-exposed plants transplanted to protected sites increased significantly relative to exposed control transplants. Mean sizes of wave-protected plants transplanted to exposed sites decreased significantly relative to protected control transplants.
   These data support but modify an accompanying mathematical model that predicts size-dependent survivorship of Fucus under conditions of high and low wave exposure. This model incorporates the trade-off between higher reproductive capacity and lower probability of survival at larger plant sizes. ''Optimal'' plant sizes predicted by the model closely match the mean observed sizes of plants collected from exposed and protected locations. However, the match between observed and predicted plant sizes occurred not via differential survivorship, but by direct size modification resulting from plant tattering.

AB We studied to what extent changes in the breeding performance of two insectivorous passerines, the Pied Flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) and the Great Tit (Parus major) were associated with pollution-induced variation in the biomass of invertebrate prey (spiders and insects on the ground, lepidoptera and sawfly larvae in tree canopies) in an air pollution (copper smelter) gradient. At the nestling time of both species, larvae were scarce in Scotch pine (the dominant tree species) close to the factory complex, peaked in the moderately polluted zone 2-4 km from the factory, and tended to decrease farther away. Both bird species preferred pine, particularly in the moderately polluted zone, where the proportion of larvae in the diet of P. major was high. Ground-living arthropods were scarce near the factory, but among-site variation was high even in the cleanest area. Breeding success of both bird species correlated positively with prey biomass, but only in P. major was food abundance correlated with nestling growth. Also, the productivity of different-sized clutches was affected in P. major, but not in F. hypoleuca. Large F. hypoleuca clutches produced more fledglings than did smaller clutches in all parts of the pollution gradient. For P. major this was true only in the moderately or slightly polluted parts of the gradient; in the most polluted areas, clutches of 6-11 eggs invariably produced 3-4 fledglings. The stronger impact of food on P. major than on F. hypoleuca probably resulted from a different diet. F. hypoleuca, which forages much from the ground layer, was susceptible to direct effects of pollutants at the egg stage, whereas P. major; a caterpillar specialist, suffered from the shortage of larvae in the late nestling period. Our results indicate that the reduced breeding performance of birds in the polluted area may be due to various reasons; one species may respond directly to toxicity, and the other species to reduced food supply.

AB The risk of dislodgment due to hydrodynamic forces on rocky intertidal shores is greater on wave-exposed than an protected shores, and this:is believed to represent an important selective force in intertidal communities. For intertidal snails, the probability of dislodgment by a given flow is determined, in part, by shell size and shape, and by the attachment strength of the foot. This study addressed two questions. First, do habitat-specific differences in traits that reduce the risk of dislodgment of an intertidal snail(Littorina obtusata) parallel differences in wave energies? To address this question, I measured variation in (1) shell size (defined as the maximum projected surface area, MPSA); (2) foot size; (3) maximum shear dislodgment force; and (4) tenacity (dislodgment force per unit foot size) of two wave-exposed and three protected snail populations. Second, are habitat-specific differences in foot size, and hence attachment strength, the product of selection or of phenotypic plasticity in response to increased hydrodynamic stress? I conducted field transplant experiments and a laboratory flume experiment that manipulated water velocity to test for plasticity in foot size.
   Wave-exposed snails exhibited traits that reduce the risk of dislodgment. Their shells were smaller (MPSA) and more squat (shell height relative to MPSA and shell length) than were shells of protected conspecifics. Wave-exposed snails also had larger foot sizes and were thus able to resist greater shear dislodgment forces than protected conspecifics of similar MPSA. Neither wave exposure nor collection site influenced tenacity, indicating that the greater dislodgment forces of wave-exposed snails were due to their larger foot sizes. Assuming that MPSA is proportional to speed-specific drag, which is reasonable for bluff bodies, I found that dislodgment force was proportional to drag. Foot size scaled isometrically with MPSA, and dislodgment force scaled isometrically with foot size, indicating that the risk of dislodgment does not change as snails grow.
   The field and laboratory flume experiments provide the first clear demonstration that increased hydrodynamic stress induces plastic increases in foot size. Protected snails raised on a wave-exposed shore produced a larger foot than controls raised on their native shore. Selection on the foot size of protected snails raised on both shores was not detected in either habitat. Protected snails also produced larger foot sizes when raised in high-velocity flumes relative to snails raised under low-velocity flow. In contrast, wave-exposed snails exhibited no change in foot size when raised under both high- and low-velocity flow. Hence, variation in the foot size of wave-exposed snails is less flexible than that of protected conspecifics. If natural selection favors plasticity in heterogeneous environments, an asymmetry may be favored as well, especially if there are risks associated with improper adjustments to unpredictable environmental cues.

AB Endophytic fungi inhabiting foliage of woody plants are diverse and abundant, yet little is known of their temporal and spatial variation or their interactions with more commonly studied invertebrate and vertebrate macroherbivores. We studied seasonal and yearly variation in endophyte infections in five Emery oak trees over a 4-yr period from 1989 to 1993. In the 1992-1993 growing season, we documented seasonal patterns of abundance of the three most common fungal endophyte species, an ascomycete, Ophiognomonia cryptica, and two coelomycete species, Plectophomella sp. and Asteromella sp.
   To determine the association of fungal endophytes with macroherbivores, we compared infection frequencies of endophytes in unmined leaves and leaves harboring living and dead larval leafminers of Cameraria sp. nov., the dominant macroherbivore on Emery oak, over the 4-yr period. In the 1992-1993 growing season, we monitored survival and mortality of leafmining larvae on the five study trees. We then determined the association of total infections and infections by individual endophyte species with seasonal survival and sources of mortality of leafminers.
   Infection levels of endophytes varied over the 4-yr period, but seasonal patterns within years were consistent. The three dominant species of endophytes varied differently in frequencies over the growing season.
   Leafminers were positively associated with endophytic infections' in all years. In two of the four years, leaves with living leafmining larvae had greater total infection frequencies than unmined leaves. In one of these years, infection frequencies were greater in leaves with dead larvae than in those with living larvae, suggesting that endophytes may increase mortality of leafminers. However, when infection levels of individual species were compared among leaf types, only levels of Asteromella were greater in mined leaves relative to unmined ones. This difference was explained largely by higher infection levels in leaves with living larvae than in leaves with dead larvae. Furthermore, seasonal changes in endophyte levels varied independently from seasonal changes in leafminer mortality from unexplained causes or natural enemies. We conclude that leafmining activity is associated with higher endophyte infections, but increased infections are not associated with increased leafminer mortality. Higher infections on mined leaves are likely caused by leafmining damage that enhances fungal colonization and penetration into oak leaves.
   Although endophytes of Emery oak are diverse and abundant and their presence is associated with leafmining activity, we do not find strong correlative evidence that endophytes interact mutualistically with Emery oak by increasing resistance to a dominant herbivore, the leafminer Cameraria. A companion paper (Faeth and Hammon 1997) corroborates experimentally the lack of antagonistic interaction between endophytes and the leafminer.

AB Statistical inference for capture-recapture studies of open animal populations typically relies on the assumption that all emigration from the studied population is permanent. However, there are many instances in which this assumption is unlikely to be met. We define two general models for the process of temporary emigration: completely random and Markovian. We then consider effects of these two types of temporary emigration on Jolly-Seber estimators and on estimators arising from the full-likelihood approach to robust design data.
   Capture-recapture data arising from Pollock's robust design provide the basis for obtaining unbiased estimates of demographic parameters in the presence of temporary emigration, and for estimating the probability of temporary emigration. We present a likelihood-based approach to dealing with temporary emigration that permits estimation under different models of temporary emigration and yields tests for completely random and Markovian emigration. In addition, we use the relationship between capture probability estimates based on closed and open models under completely random temporary emigration to derive three ad hoc estimators for the probability of temporary emigration. Two of these should be especially useful in situations where capture probabilities are heterogeneous among individual animals. Ad hoc and full-likelihood estimators are illustrated for small-mammal capture-recapture data sets.
   We believe that these models and estimators will be useful for testing hypotheses about the process of temporary emigration, for estimating demographic parameters in the presence of temporary emigration, and for estimating probabilities of temporary emigration. These latter estimates are frequently of ecological interest as indicators of animal movement and, in some sampling situations, as direct estimates of breeding probabilities and proportions.

AB Pathogens affect the evolution of their hosts only to the extent that the host's ability to reproduce is altered. Microbotryum violaceum is a pollinator-transmitted fungal pathogen that causes infected individuals to produce sterile flowers with anthers full of fungal spores. In North American Rocky Mountain populations of Silene acaulis, a host to M. violaceum, reproduction in infected individuals is severely affected, but disease spread is slow (<1% new infections over a 4-yr period). This study addresses whether diseased plants can affect reproduction in healthy individuals even if the healthy plant does not become diseased. I studied Silene acaulis in the field to examine traits of diseased and healthy plants, pollen deposition, spore deposition, and seed production in healthy plants. Diseased plants were significantly larger than healthy plants, and in contrast to other studies of anther smut with different hosts, infected individuals did not produce more flowers than healthy individuals. Timing of flowering was similar for healthy and diseased plants, but peak deposition of pollen and fungal spores differed at some sites. Therefore, plants could potentially maximize their fitness by flowering at times of peak deposition of pollen while avoiding exposure to peak deposition of fungal spores. Finally, healthy flowers receiving additions of pollen and moderate to high loads of fungal spores produced significantly less seed compared to flowers receiving only pollen. Although the risk of becoming diseased may be low in this population, healthy individuals can be affected by anther smut because the majority of flowers receive fungal spores, which may be interfering with pollen grains and reducing seed production.

AB I report evidence of plasticity in the mode of embryo nourishment by female poeciliid fish raised under contrasting environmental conditions. In two experiments, female sailfin mollies (Poecilia latipinna), raised on high and low levels of food, produced neonates of similar mass and percentage of fat by varying egg size and the amount of supplemental nourishment provided to embryos as they developed. In one experiment, females displayed plasticity in ovum size, but not neonate size; females raised in a low-food and low-salinity treatment produced larger eggs than those raised on higher food levels and at higher salinity. In a second experiment, the amount of nourishment provided to embryos, in addition to that in the egg yolk, was dependent on brood size and maternal food level. Females with small broods were less matrotrophic than those with large broods; female body size and brood size were highly correlated. The brood size at which egg mass equaled neonate mass was smaller for females raised on low levels of food than for females raised on a higher food level treatment. In the second experiment, females from two populations, different from the source of fish for the first experiment, were studied and found to differ in the amount of fat stores remaining after reproduction. Females from a population with low postparturition fat stores displayed greater brood reduction during gestation (via resorption or abortion) and fewer offspring per unit mass than females from the population with more fat. In sailfin mollies, matrotrophy appears to be an adaptation that diminishes the offspring size-offspring number trade-off by permitting a reduction in ovum size and increase in fecundity without compromising neonate size. However, matrotrophic supplementation of yolk nourishment was greatest in relatively large females raised on a restricted food level. Thus, matrotrophy may incur some energetic cost that renders it inefficient for small females and for females with substantial or dependable energy reserves available for reproduction.

AB Mark-recapture models have been widely used in ecology to estimate population sizes of animals. In contrast, estimation of plant population size has usually been assumed to be much easier. However, detection of individuals is difficult for perennial plants, such as the rare prairie plant Mead's milkweed (Asclepias meadii), which does not produce aboveground parts every year and lives in dense vegetation where nonflowering stems are hard to observe. In these cases, a count of the number of plants observed in a particular year may greatly underestimate the true population size, just as a count of animals in traps does not adequately estimate the total number of animals in an area. Using a family of closed population models (CAPTURE), we applied mark-recapture methodology to estimate population size of A. meadii. Over a 4-yr period, a total of 129 patches (aggregated collections of stems) was observed, with 124 flowering in at least one year. In any one year, however, the number of flowering patches ranged from 15 to 105. Using model M-th of CAPTURE with these data, the estimated number of patches capable of flowering was 219. Although the confidence interval is broad (95% confidence interval of 175-302), these results emphasize that the observed number of patches in any one year, or even over a 4-yr period, underestimates the actual population size.

AB Allocation of stored and incoming nutrients to reproduction determines an organism's age-specific fecundity curve. In holometabolous insects, differences among species in the shape of the curve are correlated with differences in the potential importance of adult food to reproduction. I examined allocation patterns underlying this association. Specific changes throughout life in body mass and reproductive effort were predicted to result from use of stored vs. incoming nutrients for reproduction and other metabolic needs at each age. Data for three nymphalid butterfly species, Euphydryas editha, Speyeria mormonia, and Heliconius charitonius, were compared with the predictions. These three species differ in adult diet and fraction of oocytes mature at adult emergence (hence, potential for adult nutrients to be used to make eggs), with E. editha showing the least potential for use of adult nutrients in egg production and H. charitonius showing the greatest potential. For all three species, body mass declined with age, although nonlinearly for E. editha. This indicated that metabolic expenditures were greater than intake at all ages, and that a constant fraction of stored nutrients was allocated to reproduction and other metabolic uses at each age for E. editha. Reproductive effort also declined with age for all three species. The specific patterns seen suggested that incoming nutrients may be stored, to some extent, early in life and then used late in life by both S. mormonia and H. charitonius. The similarity between S. mormonia and H. charitonius is rather surprising, given the qualitative differences in adult diet and suggests either that qualitative age-specific allocation patterns for incoming vs. stored nutrients may be independent of adult diet quality, or that the observed patterns are constrained by phylogenetic relatedness of these two species.

AB If the observed properties of food webs vary with the completeness of the data on which they are based, then the incompleteness of most collected webs may mislead us about their actual properties. Using a large, moderately well-known web, we simulated ecologists' efforts to detect member species and links between them at a variety of sampling intensities, and then we analysed the effects of sampling intensity on a large number of properties of the resulting webs. Four striking points emerged. First, the properties of this single web vary markedly with the intensity of sampling: incompleteness of data can strongly bias estimates of food-web properties. Second, the original values are reached only after a high level of sampling, much higher than is typical for many studies. Third, the properties of most webs in the ECOWeB database lie at the poorly sampled end of the ranges. Fourth, the detection of trophic links systematically lags behind the detection and inclusion of species, which may render the accurate measurement of many web properties inherently problematic. These results suggest that both the incompleteness of the existing data and our focus on properties that are sensitive to that incompleteness may be giving us a misleading picture of the trophic structure of ecological communities.

AB Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) is an increasingly popular method for multivariate analysis of ecological community data. It is, however, one of the most potentially misleading multivariate methods for community analysis. Inclusion of noisy or irrelevant environmental variables can distort the representation of gradients in community structure. These hazards are illustrated with simulated community data sets having a known, simple, underlying structure, then introducing different kinds and degrees of noise into the environmental data. Because of its sensitivity to even a modest amount of noise in the environmental data, CCA with site scores as linear combinations of environmental variables is inappropriate when the objective is to describe community structure. These problems can be avoided by using traditional indirect ordination methods, where pure community structure is expressed, without any constraint imposed by the environmental variables. CCA can be appropriate, however, when the objective is to describe how species respond to particular sets of observed environmental variables.

AB The nitrogen-productivity (N-productivity) concept represents one approach for development of algorithms for expansion from the individual tree to stand or landscape levels of estimation of primary production across the Earth's surface. A simple equation based on the N-productivity concept can be used to estimate plant production from the individual tree to stand level geographic units. Maximum N-productivity equations were developed for balsam poplar, white birch, and white spruce on an individual tree basis for the taiga of interior Alaska. Maximum N-productivity equations were also developed for aspen, balsam poplar, and white spruce on a unit area basis (square meters). A single equation for all species sampled and individual stands was developed on a unit area basis. The calculated productivity for test stands was in close agreement to the measured productivity from the landscape perspective. The set of equations presented can be used for calculation of taiga forest productivity in a geographic model developed within a GIS (Geographic Information System) software package in which the landscape unit is an integral part of the model structure.

AB Ecological processes near habitat edges often differ from processes away from edges. Yet, the generality of ''edge effects'' has been hotly debated because results vary tremendously. To understand the factors responsible for this variation, we described nest predation and cowbird distribution patterns in forest edge and forest core habitats on 36 randomly selected plots in three states in the midwestern United States. We tested four hypotheses that may explain the variation and mechanisms responsible for edge effects among the 36 plots: (1) the landscape context, (2) the local predator community, (3) the local bird (host-prey) community, and (4) the nest site microhabitat structure. We used artificial nests baited with quail and clay eggs to determine nest predation patterns and predators and used point count surveys to determine cowbird and host abundance in forest edge and forest core habitats.
   Raccoons, opossums, canids, and birds accounted for most predation of artificial nests. Neither local host abundance nor mean nest concealment of artificial nests significantly influenced nest predation rates in habitat edge or in habitat core. Nest predation was significantly greater in highly fragmented landscapes than in unfragmented landscapes and was significantly higher in edge habitats than in core habitats. However, detection of edge effects varied, depending upon landscape type. Higher predation rates in edge habitats were detected in highly and moderately fragmented landscapes, but not in unfragmented landscapes. Both mammalian and avian predator groups contributed to higher predation rates along edges in highly and moderately fragmented landscapes.
   Cowbird abundance was significantly related to host abundance, but the effect of hosts varied depending upon habitat type. In edge habitats, cowbird abundance was negatively associated with host abundance in all three landscapes studied. By contrast, cowbird abundance was positively associated with host abundance in core habitats. Once the effects of host abundance were removed, cowbird abundance in core habitat was greater in highly fragmented landscapes than in moderately and unfragmented landscapes, but did not differ between the latter two. In edge habitat, cowbird abundance did not differ between landscapes, but abundance in edges tended to be highest in the highly fragmented landscape and lowest in the unfragmented landscape. Cowbird abundance did not vary between edge and core habitat in any of the landscapes studied.
   We suggest that the first approximation to predicting the impact of agricultural or permanently managed edges on forest songbird reproductive success is to assess habitat characteristics at the landscape scale. Given geographic location, local factors such as host abundance and predator composition should be assessed.

AB Galapagos marine iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) populations show considerable differences in body size. Adult body mass varies by more than 10-fold, and body length (snout-vent length, SVL) varies by approximate to 2.2-fold. Predation and interspecific food competition are largely absent and can be excluded as potential forces explaining differences in body size among populations. This provides an ideal system in which to determine how proximate environmental factors affect adult body size, We compared the small iguanas from Genovesa Island (mean adult male SVL 250 mm) to the larger Santa Fe iguanas (mean adult male SVL 400 mm). Marine iguanas forage on intertidal algae pastures in scramble competition. Energy availability was lower on Genovesa than on Santa Fe, because of lower marine productivity on Genovesa. The length of grazable algal turf decreased with increasing sea surface temperature (SST). SST was approximate to 2 degrees C lower on Santa Fe than on Genovesa, implying approximate to 1.5 mm lower algae pastures on the latter. Genovesa showed a fivefold lower standing algal biomass and a twofold lower productivity of algae pastures than did Santa Fe. The smallest iguanas of each island had approximate to 1.5-fold higher bite rates during foraging, and their absolute food intake per day was 35% that of the largest iguanas. However, food intake per bite per gram of body mass was about twice as high for small iguanas as for large iguanas. Large iguanas of both islands showed a marked decline in body mass during the two study years, whereas small iguanas (SVL < 170 mm on Genovesa and < 320 mm on Santa Fe) increased in mass, Growth rates of SVL reflected these findings. A comparison of measured metabolizable energy with published field metabolic rates (FMR) suggested that iguanas above a threshold size were in negative energy balance, because energy intake scaled to body mass with a lower exponent (0.3) than FMR (0.97). Threshold body size was lower on Genovesa than on Santa Fe and differed between years: In the lean El Nino year (1991/1992), iguanas > 200 mm SVL on Genovesa and > 310 mm SVL on Santa Fe significantly lost mass; in the more productive year (1992/1993), thresholds were 230 mm and 350 mm SVL, respectively. Thus, food abundance (length and turnover of algal swards) explained differences in adult body length and mass between islands as a result of energetic limitation. On a given island, foraging efficiency (intake/bite) explained the negative energy balance of large compared to small iguanas. This also explained why, on both islands, the largest animals suffered higher mortality rates than did medium-sized ones when food was scarce. The finding that small animals outcompeted larger ones because of their higher foraging efficiency resembles the grazing succession in ungulate herbivores.

AB A central question in ecology is explaining spatial variation in the abundance of species. Patterns of spatial variation in abundance can often be explained by spatial variation in the environment, including resource availability, climatic variables, and other factors that influence a species' reproduction and survival. We show that spatial patterns in abundance may also be driven by temporal environmental variation, in the absence of any fixed spatial environmental variation. To illustrate this, we build on work by J. H. Brown, D. W. Mehlman, and G. C. Stevens, who demonstrated spatial patterns in bird abundances that can be explained by fixed spatial variation in the environment. Using a pair of simple stochastic models of bird population dynamics, we show that similar patterns can be generated through temporal environmental variation that has no fixed spatial component. This occurs when population dynamics are characterized by Very weak density dependence, so that population densities exhibit near-random-walk behavior. Because similar patterns of spatial variation in species' abundances can be produced by either fixed spatial environmental variation or spatiotemporal environmental variation, we interpreting spatial variation in abundance may sometimes require understanding temporal variation in abundance.

AB A tight trade-off between competitive and colonization abilities is a key assumption of so-called ''extinction debt models.'' This trade-off implies that species ranked high in competitive ability will be ranked low with respect to dispersal. Although such a strict trade-off is plausible as a general trend, there are many examples in nature of deviations from perfect trade-offs. To determine how robust the ''extinction debt'' phenomenon is to imperfect trade-off relationships, I reexamined the extinction debt model of Tilman et al. in light of imperfect trade-offs. Numerically solving a system of differential equations, I found that, although the extinction debt phenomenon is not eliminated by the presence of imperfect trade-offs, the loss of species occurs earlier (with less habitat destruction) and more linearly than with perfect trade-offs.

AB Patterns of seed predation, germination, and seedling herbivory were investigated in Panamanian forests. We hypothesized that seed and seedling survival would vary with differences in mammal community composition. We tested this hypothesis at five sites in mainland forests adjacent to Gatun Lake, full terrestrial mammalian granivore/herbivore communities with top predators; at five sites on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), also a full mammalian granivore/herbivore community but without the two largest cats; at one site each on five medium-sized islands, with rats, agouti, rabbit, and paca present; and on five small islands that support rats only. Experiments were replicated for Dipteryx panamensis, Gustavia superba, and Virola nobilis, all of which have large seeds. To assess seed removal, seeds were placed in wire exclosure cages and nearby outside the cages. There was no difference in removal rates between forest types, with almost all unprotected seeds removed at all sites. To assess post-removal seed fate, seeds of Gustavia and Virola were attached to threads and placed on the forest floor. All threaded seeds were victims of predation on small islands, whereas 34, 43, and 77% of threaded seeds were dispersed and buried on BCI, medium islands, and the mainland, respectively. To assess seedling herbivory, half of the wire exclosure cages were removed after germination, and seedling survival was assessed after 13-14 mo. Protection from mammals increased seedling survivorship by more than sixfold on the smallest islands, by threefold on the medium islands, by twofold on the mainland, and by less than twofold on BCI.
   The absence of the two largest cats and the exclusion of poachers from BCI was associated with lower seedling herbivory and higher seed predation than observed on the mainland. In contrast, extreme mammal defaunation on the small and medium islands had large and consistent effects on seedling recruitment, including increased seed predation and increased seedling herbivory relative to sites with more intact mammal communities.

AB We examined how biotic factors (natural assemblages of omnivorous fishes) control the community response of primary producers to physical disturbance (frequent high discharge events) in a lowland tropical stream. As a secondary objective, we assessed effects of fishes on benthic insects. We used electric ''fences'' to exclude access of fishes to benthic communities in a riffle of a fourth-order stream draining the foothills on Costa Rica's Caribbean slope. Benthic algae and aquatic insects accessible to fishes were subject to intense omnivory by a diverse assemblage of fishes. Over a 7-wk period in the rainy season, three large discharge events occurred in which water levels rose up to 3 m above base flow, discharge increased by up to 160-fold, and suspended gravel and small cobbles caused major scouring. Fishes significantly affected algal succession, community composition, and response to high discharge events. Algal assemblages that developed in the presence of fishes were dominated by filamentous blue-green algae (Lyngbya sp.), whereas diatom assemblages prevailed where fishes were excluded. Fishes significantly reduced numbers of larval Chironomidae (Diptera) and total insects.
   Algal biovolume was higher and more variable in the absence of fishes than in their presence: significant (P < 0.05) reductions in algal biovolume occurred in the diatom-dominated fish exclusion treatment in response to high discharge. In contrast, in the presence of fishes, algal biovolume increased steadily through time and was not significantly reduced by storms. The third and most severe storm event (39-40 d) resulted in decreases in total algal biovolume, diatom biovolume, algal taxon diversity, and richness in the fish exclusion treatment. However, these parameters increased (despite the storm) in the presence of fishes. Our results show that fishes play a key role in maintaining the stability of benthic algal assemblages and their resistance to storm events. Moreover, results suggest that in the absence of omnivorous fishes, high discharge events would play a major role in structuring benthic algal assemblages, resulting in extreme fluctuations in algal biomass.

AB We examined the effects of living plant neighbors and litter on the performance of a native C-4 grass, Andropogon gerardi, at five old-field sites that differ in community biomass and soil fertility. We used plant removal experiments in which both living neighbors and litter were manipulated in a factorial arrangement of treatments over one growing season. Andropogon was added to treatment plots as seeds and as established transplants to examine the effects of the surrounding plant community on the recruitment and established phases of its life history.
   Neighbors negatively affected Andropogon performance at all sites, indicating that resource exploitation by living plants was an important constraint to seedling recruitment and growth across the range of community biomass examined. Plant litter negatively affected recruitment at sites with the greatest community biomass, but had no effect on the growth of established transplants at any of the sites. The total effect of the surrounding plant community on recruitment was positively correlated with community biomass due to an increasing impact of plant litter. However, the total effect of the surrounding community on the growth of established transplants was unrelated to community biomass.
   The results suggest that it may be during the recruitment phase of the life history, when seeds and seedlings are especially susceptible to the effects of both litter and living neighbors, that Andropogon is most sensitive to variation in community biomass. Variation in the effects of litter on recruitment may be important in regulating plant species diversity and the distribution of native C-4 grasses along old-field biomass gradients in southwest Michigan.

AB We compiled life tables for 78 holometabolous herbivorous insect species to quantify levels of apparent enemy-induced mortality of immature insects. Enemies were classified by type (predator, parasitoid, or pathogen), and mortalities caused by each type in each herbivore immature stage were tested with Analysis of Deviance for differences associated with four ecological characteristics of preadult herbivores: feeding biology, invasion status, and the cultivation status and latitudinal zone of the habitat. Total enemy-induced mortality is higher in the late developmental stages, and overall, parasitoids kill more herbivores than do either predators or pathogens. Among the ecological variables, both feeding biology and latitude showed significant enemy effects in at least one late developmental stage, whereas neither cultivation status nor invasion status was associated with enemy-induced mortality in any stage. Bonferroni adjustment of probabilities for multiple comparisons resulted in few significant interactions between enemy type and the ecological variables. However, raw probabilities and comparisons across herbivore immature stages suggest several patterns that deserve attention in future studies: (1)endophytic herbivores suffer lower mortality by predators and pathogens than exophytics, and endophytic leaf miners suffer the greatest parasitoid-induced mortality, while endophytic gallers/borers/root feeders suffer the least; (2) overall enemy-induced mortality is similar in natural and cultivated habitats; (3) exotic insects do not suffer lower enemy-induced mortality rates than natives; and (4) predation and disease may be greater in tropical/subtropical habitats, whereas parasitism is greater in the temperate zone. These results identify several general patterns in insect demographics that should be useful for hypothesis testing.

AB If plants cannot simultaneously acclimate to shade and drought because of physiological trade-offs, then plants are expected to be less tolerant to shading under drier conditions. One observation that, at first sight, seems incompatible with this idea is the fact that the establishment of new plants in dry areas is often restricted to shady sites under the canopy of other plants, called ''nurse plants.'' We use a graphical model to resolve this paradox. The model visualizes how facilitative patterns can be understood from the simultaneous effects of plant canopies on microsite light and moisture, and the growth response of establishing seedlings to those factors. The approach emphasizes the fact that positive and negative effects of plant canopies always occur simultaneously. In the presented light-water model, facilitation only occurs when the improvement of plant water relations under the canopy exceeds the costs caused by lower light levels. This may be true under dry conditions, whereas in less dry situations, competition rather than facilitation is observed. The model shows how changes in water availability may shift interactions from competitive to facilitative and vice versa, as observed in some field patterns. It is argued that other environmental factors explaining facilitative patterns can be understood in the same context.

AB Insects whose larvae depend on developing seed are very common, but active pollination, meaning that the insect possesses specific structures and behaviors for the purpose of assuring pollination, is only known to have evolved twice in such insects, namely in yucca moths and in fig wasps. This rarity could be due to high cost of pollination, phylogenetic constraints, alternative life history shifts to reduce or avoid risk of seed nondevelopment, or ecological factors such as co-pollinators that can satiate pollen requirements and mask variation in pollinator effectiveness among ovipositing seed eaters. Ecological costs of being a pollinator were measured for a yucca moth species and were found to be low: active time allocated to pollen pickup and deposit was on average 4.1%, an average of 0.42% of female body mass was allocated to specific structures for pollen manipulation, and the average pollen load weighed <4% of moth body mass. These estimates suggest that ecological costs need not be a major obstacle to evolution of active pollination. In contrast, recent combined ecological-phylogenetic analyses for the yucca moth family suggest that the evolution of active pollination and transition to mutualism depended largely on preadaptations, and that few traits were truly novel. If general, active pollination would be predicted to be likely to evolve only in lineages with life histories that facilitate mutualism. Alternative outcomes to evolution of active pollination include delayed oviposition, detection of floral pollination status, egg placement that allows the larva to select a fruit, and modified egg dispersion strategies to balance the cost of pollination. The historical significance of these factors can be assessed only when mechanisms are documented in many lineages and analyzed in a phylogenetic framework.
   Active fungal inoculation among arthropods is ecologically analogous to active pollination, and offers a complement for comparative analyses. Specific structures for spore transport have evolved many times in at least three orders of insects, and several times in mites. The large number of independent lineages of active pollen and fungus dispersers jointly provide a platform for testing hypotheses about, e.g., the role of preadaptations in evolution of mutualism, reversals of mutualism, and the role of mutualism in diversification.

AB Most marine animals have complex life histories with dispersive larvae. Recruitment to marine populations should then result from larval production external to each population (i.e., an open population). However, it has been suggested that self-recruitment to these populations may also be important (i.e., a closed system). The contribution of these two sources of larval supply to recruitment were explored using the Hawaiian domino damselfish, Dascyllus albisella. Spawning and recruitment were monitored daily and weekly in the southeast section of Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii, during 1992. Daily increment formation in the otoliths of this species was validated, and the spawning dates of arriving recruits were back-calculated using otolith rings. Since this section of Kaneohe Bay is sheltered, with a water exchange rate of only 26% per day, I predicted larvae would be retained (passively and behaviorally) after hatching; therefore recruitment from locally spawned larvae would be important.
   Contrary to my prediction, no self-recruitment was evident. Spawning times and backcalculated production of recruits did not overlap on a daily or seasonal basis. During the first half of the year, recruitment pulses were large and associated with rises in water temperature. During the latter half of the year, recruitment rates were lower and recruitment events were not associated with water temperature. Given the apparent absence of self-recruitment and the seasonal pattern of oceanographic currents in the Hawaiian Islands, recruitment episodes in the first half of the year may have originated from distinct reproductive episodes at upcurrent islands. Recruitment episodes in the latter half of the year may have resulted from a general increase in D. albisella spawning external to Kaneohe Bay.

AB We used a process-based model of ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics, MEL-GEM (Marine Biological Laboratory General Ecosystem Model), to integrate and analyze the results of several experiments that examined the response of arctic tussock tundra to manipulations of CO2, temperature, light, and soil nutrients. The experiments manipulated these variables over 3- to 9-yr periods and were intended to simulate anticipated changes in the arctic environment. Our objective was to use the model to extend the analysis of the experimental data so that unmeasured changes in ecosystem C storage and the underlying mechanisms controlling those changes could be estimated and compared. Using an inverse calibration method, we derived a single parameter set for the model that closely simulated the measured responses of tussock tundra to all of the experimental treatments. This parameterization allowed us to infer confidence limits for ecosystem components and processes that were not directly measured in the experiments. Thus, we used the model to estimate changes in ecosystem C storage by inferring key soil processes within the constraints imposed by measured components of the ecosystem C budget. Because tussock tundra is strongly N limited, we hypothesized that changes in ecosystem C storage in response to the experimental treatments would be constrained by several key aspects of C-N interactions: (1) changes in the amount of N in the ecosystem, (2) changes in the C:N ratios of vegetation and soil, and (3) redistribution of N between soil (with a low C:N ratio) and vegetation (with a high C:N ratio). The model results reveal widely differing patterns of change in C-N interactions and constraints on change in ecosystem C storage among treatments. For example, after 9 yr the elevated CO2 (2 x ambient) treatment and the N fertilized (10 g N.m(-2) yr(-1)) treatment increased ecosystem C stocks by 1.4 and 2.9%, respectively. Whereas the increase in the CO2 treatment was due solely to an increase in the C:N ratios of vegetation and soil, the increase in the fertilized treatment was due to increased ecosystem N content and a shift of N from soil to vegetation. In contrast, the greenhouse (3.5 degrees C above ambient) and shade (one-half ambient light) treatments decreased ecosystem C stocks by 1.9 and 2.7%, respectively. The primary reason for the net C losses in these treatments was an increase in respiration relative to photosynthesis, with a consequent decrease in the ecosystem C:N ratio, However, when we simulated the elevated temperatures in the greenhouse treatment without the confounding effects of decreased light intensity (an artifact of the greenhouse structures), there was a long-term increase in ecosystem C stocks because of increased photosynthetic response to the temperature-induced shift of N from soil to vegetation. If our simulated changes in ecosystem C storage are extrapolated for the approximate to 43 Pg C contained in arctic tundras globally, the maximum net gain or loss (approximate to 0.3% per yr) from tundra would be equivalent to 0.13 Pg C/yr. Although fluxes of this magnitude would have a relatively minor impact on current changes in atmospheric CO2, the long-term impact on tundra C stores could be significant. The synthesis and insights provided by the model should make it possible to extrapolate into the future with a better understanding of the processes governing long-term changes in tundra C storage.

AB Endophytic fungi are diverse and abundant in woody plants and are thought to increase resistance of host trees to invertebrate and vertebrate herbivores. We performed two experimental manipulations of endophytic fungi in the field to test the long-term and short-term effects of individual endophyte species on growth, development, and survival of leafmining larvae of Cameraria sp. nov. (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae). In the first experiment, we compared long-term survival and mass of larvae surviving to pupation on branches with elevated infections of the endophytic fungus Asteromella sp. to survival and mass of larvae inhabiting control branches. In the second experiment, we compared shortterm survival, developmental time, and mass of pupae in mines injected with one of three common endophytic fungal species Asteromella sp., Plectophomella sp., or a filamentous yeast, relative to controls.
   Long-term survival and size of surviving larvae did not differ between leafminers on control branches and leafminers on branches with elevated endophyte infections. Likewise, larvae within mines injected with known quantities of spores and hyphae from three endophytic fungal species did not differ in survival or pupal mass from larvae in control mines. However, larvae in leaf mines injected with two of the endophytes developed more slowly than did larvae in control branches and thus may suffer more mortality from leaf abcission.
   Our results call into question the generality of mutualisms between endophytic fungi and their host plants predicated on increasing resistance to macroherbivores. Interactions between micro- and macroherbivores in foliage of woody plants are likely to be as highly variable and complex as interactions in other well-studied communities.

AB The effects of periodic gales on Nothofagus (southern beech) stand development and landscape dynamics were studied in a 10.4-km(2) study area in the Sierra de las Pinturas, part of the Andes in Argentine Tierra del Fuego. We reconstructed blowdown history (patch sizes, dates of origin, return intervals) since the late 1700s to assess how periodic large-scale wind disturbance influenced landscape pattern in a relatively simple system. Most previous studies have focused on single storms in more diverse forests and in landscapes influenced by several disturbance types and human activities. Boundaries of post-blowdown stands were digitized from aerial photographs and analyzed within a geographic information system. Ages of blowdowns and return intervals were determined from scars, growth releases, and maximum tree ages. Discrete blowdown patches (0.1 to >100 ha) covered two-thirds of the study area and ranged from 19 to approximate to 200 yr of age, with 20-30 yr between major events. The meteorology of these storms was unknown, but we suspect they were caused by intense low-pressure systems originating in Antarctica. The mean return interval for 34 sites was 145 yr, with a range of 103-218 yr. Based on treefall size distributions, most stands blown over in the past 100 yr were even-aged, with mean tree dbh (diameter at breast height) between 20 and 32 cm. Aerial photographs taken in 1970 were used for before-and-after comparisons of a 1972 blowdown. Seventy-one percent of the area blown over in 1972 was even-aged, and 35% of the boundaries from this storm exactly coincided with previous stand boundaries. Damage patterns from storms in 1924 and 1972 suggested that forests located on valleys parallel to the wind, windward side slopes, and possibly upper leeward slopes were most vulnerable to blowdown, but few landscape positions escaped being hit by repeated storms. Return intervals were not significantly related to slope, elevation, or aspect; but surprisingly, shorter return intervals were associated with deeper soils. The landscape pattern of blowdown and recovery shifted over time because of variation among individual storms and because a small proportion of old-growth stands were converted to blowdowns and vice versa. Browsing by guanacos (Lama guanaco), a large native camelid, has severely inhibited tree regeneration during the past 75 yr in small blowdowns and the perimeters of larger ones, converting some stands to open meadows and incipient alpine communities. In the relatively simple Nothofagus forests of Tierra del Fuego, periodic gales are the main determinants of forest structure and pattern across a range of scales from small patches to entire landscapes.

AB Press perturbations, in which one or more species densities are experimentally altered and held at higher or lower levels, are common field approaches used to understand community dynamics. The outcomes of such experiments are often difficult to anticipate solely on the basis of intuition. This is because the effects of a perturbation may pass through a complex network of direct and indirect pathways in a food web, and the outcome may be highly sensitive to the strength of interactions among species. One solution to understanding outcomes of press experiments is to quantify first the community matrix, the matrix of measured direct interactions between all species in a food web, and then obtain the inverse of this matrix. The inverse of the community matrix predicts the effect of all species presses on all other species. I evaluated the utility of the inverse community matrix in predicting the outcomes of press experiments in an old-field food web. I used data from field and laboratory experiments to quantify the interaction strengths between grasshoppers, four old-field plants, and nitrogen supply. These values were used to parameterize the community matrix and obtain its inverse in a Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation was used to predict the mean and standard error in the outcome of a simultaneous nitrogen and herbivore press on food-web structure and dynamics. The predictions were compared with data from an enclosure experiment in the field in which I manipulated nitrogen supply and herbivore abundance. There was a high degree of uncertainty predicted and observed in the study system. Despite this, I show that the degree and the sources of uncertainty were predictable for each species. This suggests that the inverse community matrix offers a useful theoretical benchmark for understanding the outcome of field press experiments.

AB The degu, Octodon degus (Rodentia, Octodontidae) is a diurnal herbivore inhabiting the semiarid and mediterranean environments of northern and central Chile. In the field, degus are constrained to specific foraging areas, mainly by their limited thermal tolerance and by environmental food quality. Consequently, we hypothesized that degus must balance their diet selection by maximizing nutrients/digestible energy intake, in the face of their time and digestive constraints and seasonal/spatial changes in food quality; and by minimizing thermoregulatory risk, in the face of their low evaporative water loss and seasonal/spatial changes in environmental temperatures among foraging areas. This hypothesis was tested in a series of diet selection experiments conducted in an experimental arena, as well as in nutritional trials, involving synthetic diets with different fiber content and thermal patches. As predicted, results of the arena food selection experiments, as well as the nutritional trials, demonstrated that O. degus prefers items of low-fiber composition. However, food selection is compromised by seasonal and spatial changes in food quality and environmental temperatures, coupled with feeding time and digestive and thermoregulatory constraints.

AB The evolution of flowering phenology has most often been examined in light of one set of organisms, namely pollinators. However, the patterns of flowering phenology observed in nature are likely to reflect evolutionary compromises in response to a variety of selective forces. Two of the most important potentially opposing selective forces that could elicit such a compromise are pollinators and pre-dispersal seed predators. Using a case study from my own work on the pollinators and pre-dispersal seed predators of two members of the Polemoniaceae, Polemonium foliosissimum and Ipomopsis aggregata, I show that the outcome of selective pressures is not always predictable by examining one group of organisms or another. In addition, the outcome of separate and combined selective pressures is variable among years. Thus I show that only by considering all organisms that affect the fitness of a plant may we gain a complete understanding of the evolution of floral traits. I argue that we must account for both geographical and temporal variation in assessing the ecological and evolutionary importance of interacting organisms.

AB I studied the invasion of Rana catesbeiana (the bullfrog) into a northern California river system where bullfrogs are not native. Native yellow-legged frogs, Rana boylii, a species of special concern, were almost an order of magnitude less abundant in reaches where bullfrogs were well established. I assessed the potential role of larval competition in contributing to this displacement in a series of field manipulations of tadpole density and species composition. The impact of R. catesbeiana on native tadpoles in the natural community agreed with the outcome of more artificial experiments testing pairwise and three-way interactions. In 2-m(2) enclosures with ambient densities of tadpoles and natural river biota, bullfrog tadpoles caused a 48% reduction in survivorship of R. boylii, and a 24% decline in mass at metamorphosis. Bullfrog larvae had smaller impacts on Pacific treefrogs, Hyla regilla, causing 16% reduction in metamorph size, and no significant effect on survivorship. Bullfrog tadpoles significantly affected benthic algae, although effects varied across sites. Responses to bullfrogs in field settings were similar qualitatively to results seen in smaller-scale experiments designed to study size-structured competition among disparate age/size classes of species pairs and trios. Competition from large overwintering bullfrog larvae significantly decreased survivorship and growth of native tadpoles. Competition from recently hatched bullfrog larvae also decreased survivorship of R. boylii and H. regilla. Native species competed weakly, both interspecifically and intraspecifically. The only suggestion of a negative impact of a native species on bullfrogs was a weak effect of H. regilla on recent hatchlings. Competition appeared to be mediated by algal resources, and there was no evidence for behavioral or chemical interference. These results indicate that, through larval interactions, bullfrogs can exert differential effects on native frogs and perturb aquatic community structure.

AB Commercially important species often are overexploited, and many endangered mammals and birds are threatened by hunting and international trade. To sustain biological resources requires harvesting strategies that maximize yield while accounting for stochastic dynamics, uncertainty, and risk of resource collapse or extinction. For a large class of population dynamics, the optimal strategy is to harvest all individuals above a threshold population size, with no harvest below the threshold. Maximizing the expected cumulative harvest before extinction puts the optimal threshold at carrying capacity, regardless of the form of expected dynamics or the magnitude of stochasticity. Maximizing the mean annual yield lowers the optimal threshold, which then depends on the form of expected dynamics and the magnitude of stochasticity. Uncertainty in estimated population sizes increases the threshold, and with large uncertainty, the optimal strategy is proportional threshold harvesting, involving harvest of only a fraction of the excess in estimated population above the threshold. The theoretical justification for the common strategy of a constant harvest rate is extremely weak in comparison to that for optimal threshold strategies. Thresholds are a necessary feature of any harvesting strategy with the objective of minimizing risks of resource depletion or extinction, while optimizing yields.

AB Southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina provide a unique opportunity for examination of parental investment because postpartum pup growth is fueled exclusively by energy from stored reserves in fasting mothers, and the seals are extremely sexually dimorphic as adults. We examined the influence of pup sex, maternal size, and other factors on the variation in postpartum maternal mass change and pup growth. Elephant seals (178 mothers and 445 pups) were weighed during four breeding periods at South Georgia Island. Maternal mass change during lactation increased markedly with the mass of the mother at parturition. Postpartum maternal mass accounted for 75% of the variation in mass loss and 62% of the variation of pup mass at weaning. Size of the pup at birth explained <4% of this variation, and the sex of the pup explained virtually none (<0.1%). The duration of lactation was positively correlated with the pstpartumo mass of mothers, but negatively correlated with the rate of maternal mass loss when corrected for the effect of maternal postpartum mass. Mothers giving birth late in the season had shorter lactation periods than those that gave birth early but seemed to compensate for this by increasing the rate of mass transfer. Average transfer efficiency (pup mass gain/maternal mass loss) was 46 +/- 0.5%. Mothers lost, on average, 35% of their postpartum mass during lactation and 40% during the whole breeding period. Females whose postpartum mass increased between seasons increased their expenditure on their pups; females whose postpartum mass decreased, decreased their expenditure. These data from mothers with single pups do not clarify whether differences in investment were controlled by mothers or their offspring. However on three occasions, study females raised two pups in a season. Despite the increased demand, these females did not increase their expenditure, suggesting that levels of investment are maternally controlled. These results show that levels of expenditure in southern elephant seals appear to be determined largely by a single variable: female mass at parturition.

AB We are studying the distribution, biodiversity, and abundance of nematodes in the most extreme terrestrial environment on earth, the Dry Valley region of Antarctica. Here we report that the nematode community structure of 1-3 species in two functional groups may be the simplest soil food web of any terrestrial ecosystem. Nematodes were widespread and not correlated with moisture, C, or N, factors that define soil biotic complexity elsewhere. In a field experiment, treatments increasing soil water, carbon, and temperature, alone or in combination, generally decreased the abundance of the single omnivore-predator species and increased the abundance of its microbivorous prey species. These low-diversity nematode communities, limited to less than or equal to 3 species, apparently lack species redundancy and appear sensitive to environmental change. Our findings suggest that Antarctic soil ecosystems are sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance.

AB The maintenance of sexual reproduction by natural selection poses a paradox for evolutionary biology. Assuming ''all else equal,'' a sexual lineage producing both males and females has a slower intrinsic growth rate than a clonal lineage producing only females. Hence, clones should rapidly outcompete their sexual counterparts, unless there are ecological or mutation-clearing advantages to sex, or unless the all-else-equal assumption is incorrect. Here we examined the crucial all-else-equal assumption using a lake population of freshwater snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) in which both diploid sexual and triploid parthenogenetic individuals coexist. We contrasted the variation in life-history traits between sexual and clonal forms to the variation in life histories among habitats and sampling locations. We also conducted a laboratory experiment in which sexual snails competed with a single clone for 1 yr. We found that size at maturity varied among habitats within the lake, but this difference was not attributable to reproductive mode. There were also no differences among clonal and sexual individuals with respect either to brood size or to the frequency of developmental errors in brooded embryos. Finally, in the laboratory competition experiment, the growth rate of sexual individuals was significantly lower than the growth rate of snails from a single clone. Taken together, these results suggest that the all-else-equal assumption is correct, and that a cost of males exists in natural sexual populations of these snails.

AB We determined the responses of a model laboratory community to resource enrichment and compared these responses to the predictions of prey-dependent and ratio-dependent food chain models. Our model community consisted of Escherichia coli B and bacteriophage T4 in chemostats supplied with different concentrations of glucose. We observed the following responses to enrichment: (1) a large and highly significant increase a in the equilibrium population density of the predator, bacteriophage T4, (2) a small but significant increase in the equilibrium population density of the prey, E. coli, and (3) a large and highly significant decrease in the stability of both the predator and prey populations. These responses were better predicted by a prey-dependent model (altered to include a time delay between consumption and reproduction by predators) than by a ratio-dependent model. Enrichment had a large effect on evolutionary change in our system. Enrichment significantly decreased the amount of time required for mutants of E. coli that were resistant to predation by bacteriophage to appear in the chemostats. Enrichment also significantly increased the rate at which these bacteriophage-resistant mutants invaded the chemostats. These results were also better predicted by the prey-dependent model. Invasion by bacteriophage-resistant mutants had a large effect on the subsequent population dynamics of both predator and prey. Both the equilibrium density and stability of the E. coli population increased following invasion, and the population shifted from being primarily limited by predators to being primarily limited by resources. After invasion by the mutants, the T4 population decreased in equilibrium density, and the population cycled with an increased period. These results were compared to the predictions of a ratio-dependent model and a prey-dependent model altered to include T4-resistant mutants. The dynamics of this community were better predicted by the modified prey-dependent model; however, this model was more complex mathematically than the simpler ratio-dependent model.

AB Pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) and redear (Lepomis microlophus) sunfish are phylogenetic sister species that are specialized for molluscivory. The native ranges of these two sunfishes are allopatric, except for a small region of overlap in the Carolinas. However, for purposes of sport fishery enhancement, redear have been introduced into many northern lakes where pumpkinseed populations were native. As a result, a large zone of artificial sympatry of pumpkinseed and redear populations has been created in the last decade in lakes of southern Michigan.
   In this study I examined the feeding performance and diets of co-occurring redear and pumpkinseed both in Michigan lakes and in laboratory studies of these sunfish species from those lakes. Previous research on these species suggests that redear are morphologically and behaviorally more specialized for molluscivory than pumpkinseed, and results from the present study showed that at a given size, the crushing capacity of redear was similar to 2x greater than that of pumpkinseed. For at least the smaller size classes of sunfish, the extent of molluscivory was constrained by crushing strength. Therefore, greater crushing strength of redear allowed them to undergo an ontogenetic niche shift from a diet of predominantly soft-bodied invertebrates to a diet of snails at a smaller size than co-occurring pumpkinseed. Once molluscivorous, redear consumed larger snails than did pumpkinseed. Diet analysis also showed that following their earlier niche shift, redear were significantly more molluscivorous than sympatric pumpkinseed. Summing the effects of greater individual consumption of snails by redear and the effects of a greater proportion of a redear population being molluscivorous due to their earlier niche shift, redear were predicted to be more proficient competitors for snails. It appeared, however, that the superior feeding ability of redear on hard-bodied prey may have come at the cost of reduced efficiency at feeding on soft-bodied invertebrates.

AB Changes in the weekly abundance in two natural populations of the Turkey-oak aphid, Myzocallis boerneri, from 1975 to 1992, were analyzed using autoregression methodology to determine the nature of dynamic processes. Seasonality forms the basis of aphid population dynamics. Analysis of time series of weekly and monthly data indicate statistically detectable seasonality in density changes. The monthly data statistically adjusted for seasonal effects (deseasoned) show that density fluctuates around a seasonally changing equilibrium value. Bulmer's test of density dependence applied to the seasonally adjusted monthly data reveals density dependence. The partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots of smoothed deseasoned monthly density indicate time-lagged density-dependent processes operating between seasons and possibly on a shorter time scale of between 2 wk and 2 mo. The PACFs of smoothed deseasoned data provide statistical evidence for the existence of a ''see-saw'' relationship between density in spring, autumn, and the following spring. Analysis of annual abundances calculated from the weekly data suggests that overall abundance in any year is influenced by abundance the previous year. The pattern of changes in abundance between years is most likely the consequence of the see-saw effect operating between seasons. It is argued that aphid population density is regulated by means of density-dependent processes acting within years, which is reflected in the year-to-year changes in overall abundance.

AB We determined the trophic basis of production and quantified the food web of caddisfly larvae from the submerged woody (snag) habitat of a Coastal Plain blackwater river (Ogeechee River). Production was dominated by three net-spinning taxa (Cheumatopsyche spp., Hydropsyche rossi, and Chimarra moselyi), comprising 97-98% of the total among at least 14 trichopteran species. Annual production (as dry mass) was among the highest estimates reported for caddisflies, ranging from 43.5 to 63.9 g/m(2) of snag surface (Or from 14.2 to 25.5 g/m(2) of channel bottom) in two consecutive years. Although all taxa were present throughout the year, C. moselyi had much higher production in summer, H. rossi was highest from late summer to winter, and Cheumatopsyche spp. showed no pattern. Ingestion was determined from production estimates, bioenergetic efficiencies, and quantitative gut analyses. The two macrofiltering taxa (Cheumatopsyche spp. and H. rossi) were omnivorous, with 50.6 and 64.4% of their production, respectively, due to eating animals. Somewhat lower amounts of their production (40.7 and 23.5%) were due to ingestion of amorphous detritus. Production of the microfiltering species Chimarra moselyi was primarily due to eating amorphous detritus (91%). Removal of amorphous detritus from the system by the major taxa was highest in summer, and diatom removal was highest in fall, whereas animals were eaten consistently throughout the year. A quantitative food web showed that while the linkages among nine taxa were complex, the ingestion pathways were dominated by amorphous detritus (total consumption = 62.5 g.m(-2).yr(-1)) and animal prey (22.3 g.m(-2).yr(-1)), with >99% of food resources being consumed by the three dominant filter-feeding taxa. A connectivity food web was misleading because it implied equivalence of all food resources and consumers when great variation in strength of linkages actually existed. These comparisons provide a strong argument for considering energy flow as a measure of linkage strength when evaluating food webs, and they cast doubt on the usefulness of oversimplified connectivity webs as a basis for food web theory.

AB We investigated whether pollen deposited onto stigmas limited female reproductive success in the hummingbird-pollinated, short-lived, iteroparous, Silene virginica (Caryophyllaceae). The study was conducted over a 4-yr span in a population occurring in a woodland area and over a 3-yr span in a second population occurring in a nearby open meadow. We contrasted average fruit set, seed set per fruit, and total annual seed production (in only the woodland site) between open-pollinated control plants and hand-pollinated experimental plants. We also followed surviving individuals in subsequent years and repeated the same treatments on plants when they flowered. All plants were monitored annually for survival and reproduction at both sites; growth was monitored at only the woodland site because of extensive herbivory in the meadow population.
   Lack of pollen deposited onto stigmas significantly limited reproductive potential at the level of percentage fruit set throughout the study for both sites. In contrast, pollen deposition onto stigmas exhibited considerable site and year heterogeneity in its effect on seed production per fruit. In the cumulative test of pollen limitation, however, we detected no difference between total annual seed production between our open-pollinated control and hand-pollinated experimental plants in the woodland site during the 4-yr study. A weak negative trend was detected between fruit set per plant and average seed set per fruit among all plants in the woodland site, suggesting a limited role for an intraplant compensation mechanism. No significant trade-off was detected in probability of survival and flowering between the control and hand-pollinated experimental treatment groups at either site. In addition, no cost was detected in future growth and reproduction in the woodland population, Similar total seed production among individuals in the two treatment groups explains in part, why no difference was observed in future survival, growth, and reproduction between the control and hand-pollinated treatment groups.

AB This study investigates the role played by showy structures in the reproduction of Lavandula stoechas L. (Lamiaceae), a self-compatible Mediterranean shrub with compact, head-like inflorescences that are terminated by a tuft of conspicuous pink bracts. Pollinator visitation rates to plants with bracts correlated positively with that of paired, treated shrubs with all their bracts removed and, overall, bractless and control plants had equivalent visitation rates. In experimentally split shrubs, however, a strong effect on pollinator choice was evident, and distant visitor approaches were most often to that side keeping the attractive organs. Fecundity was not depressed in plants with reduced visual displays, and neither was the amount of pollen dispersed per flower or the size of stigmatic loads. There were, however, more pollen tubes, on average, at the lowermost part of the style in controls (10.8 tubes/style) than in bractless shrubs (8.3 tubes/style). Small, nonsignificant declines in average seed size, germinability, and seedling mass were detected following bract removal. Data support the notion that bracts are not essential to seed production in mature, relatively dense Lavandula populations where bee pollinators are often in good supply, but may be all-important if plant density is extremely low, or during population establishment. The role of an amplified display in increasing average pollination distance and progeny quality in this species is discussed.

AB The ability to exploit short-duration nutrient pulses may be an important factor in the competitive balance of plants and in shaping plant community structure. We investigated the growth responses and biomass production of six Great Basin plant species growing in monocultures in the field following a single pulse of nitrogen applied in early, mid, or late spring. As a control, we applied the same total quantity of N that was in each of the individual pulses as a continuous series of applications at twice-weekly intervals over 10 wk in the spring. Surprisingly, most of the species grown under the control, continuous N supply had lower growth rates, fewer tillers, and less biomass production than plants receiving N in a pulse. At least one of the pulse treatments increased biomass production relative to controls in all but one species. The exception to this pattern was the shrub Chrysothamnus, which responded to all pulse treatments and the control supply with equivalent growth rates and biomass production. Each species responded differently to the set of pulses, with the greatest response occurring early in the growth phase when plants were small and growth rates were high. Thus, phenological stage determined the timing of maximum response. Four of six species not only responded to the early-spring pulse, but also had their greatest response to this pulse, suggesting that the cold-season-adapted species of the Great Basin system are well suited to take advantage of this pulse. The combination of rapid plant growth rates and predictable pulses following snowmelt would likely result in intense competition for nutrients at this time. Our study demonstrates that plants are remarkably capable of utilizing pulses of N, and that pulsed nutrients are potentially important in natural systems. In addition, it suggests that studies conducted under constant nutrient supply may not reflect the responses of plants growing under pulsed nutrient conditions. The plants, instead of benefitting from a season-long continuous supply of N, at certain times during the growing season were able to use pulses of N for significant gains in biomass.

AB In the Wenatchee Mountains of central Washington State, populations of the lycaenid butterfly Euphilotes enoptes occur patchily with their sole host plant, Eriogonum compositum (Polygonaceae). Nearly all courtship and adult feeding occur on the inflorescences of this long-lived perennial. Furthermore, because females oviposit on inflorescences and larvae feed only on flowers and developing seeds, the window of opportunity for exploiting this resource is narrow. I demonstrated that inflorescence phenology varied according to the aspect and elevation of plant patches, and butterflies were most Likely to occur in patches nearing full bloom. A mark-release-recapture study revealed that individual butterflies can disperse far enough to sample from a wide range of patch phenologies, and the movements of females are apparently influenced by those phenologies. In particular, an uphill bias in female movement appeared to be the result of greater emigration from senescing low-elevation patches than from phenologically delayed, high-elevation patches. Males showed no such uphill movement. The apparent result of the uphill movement by females was that larval densities increased fourfold over a 300-m elevational gradient in each of two years. Differential mortality is an unlikely explanation for this variation in larval density, as both parasitism rates and frequency of visitation by ants, which tend larvae, did not vary with elevation.
   To demonstrate the influence of host plant phenology on adult behavior, I manipulated flowering phenology in an artificially established grid of small host plant patches and observed the encounters of adult butterflies with those patches. Inflorescences in patches that were nearing full bloom received disproportionately many visits by females, indicating that patches in this phenological state were more attractive to females. Small sample sizes prevented me from determining if this result was due to increased entry into those patches by females, an increased number of inflorescence visitations per female, or both. The frequency with which inflorescences in the different patches were visited by males did not vary with patch phenology. These results suggest that the uphill bias in dispersal by females is indeed a response to host plant phenology. Thus, in this system, among-patch variation in host plant phenology apparently influences the relative densities of larvae in different host plant patches by altering patterns of dispersal among those patches.
