AB In several taxa, the ability to feed omnivorously from more than one trophic level has evolved from more specialized feeding habits. A prerequisite for this evolutionary scenario is initial coexistence (on the same or different trophic levels) of the consumers subsequently involved in omnivory. Evolution of omnivory should also be favored by prior asymmetries in consumer interactions. I use a dynamic model to explore conditions for coexistence of two consumers depending on a single biotic resource in simple. food webs of increasing asymmetry between consumers: (1) pure resource competition, (2) resource competition with unidirectional interference, (3) omnivory, and (4) pure predation. If consumers are energy limited, omnivory is unlikely to evolve from a competitive system, because stable coexistence of two consumers on a single resource is impossible, even if there is a trade-off between resource exploitation and interference abilities. Initial coexistence of two consumers is easier to achieve, if the species are arranged in a food chain. If costs of diet generalization are low, selection should then favor the inclusion of the resource in the top consumer's diet. In systems with high resource carrying capacity, the intermediate consumer will then, however, be frequently driven to extinction-in which case omnivory is not maintained. Low nutritional quality of the resource can stabilize the omnivory system and allow three-species coexistence at high resource carrying capacities. Low nutritional quality of the resource may also create conditions for the evolution of omnivory from a competitive system. If the content of an essential nutrient in resource biomass is dynamic, stable coexistence of two competitors becomes possible if both are limited by the nutrient content of the resource. In this case, selection may favor the, evolution of omnivory, because competitor biomass is usually of higher nutritional quality than resource biomass. An explicit treatment of flexible resource stoichiometry thus broadens the possibilities for the evolution of omnivory.

AB Predictions that result from scientific research hold great appeal for decision-makers who are grappling with complex and controversial environmental issues, by promising to enhance their ability to determine a need for and outcomes of alternative decisions. A problem exists in that decision-makers and scientists in the public and private sectors solicit, produce, and use such predictions with little understanding of their accuracy or utility, and often without systematic evaluation or mechanisms of accountability. In order to contribute to a more effective role for ecological science in support of decision-making, this paper discusses three "best practices" for quantitative ecosystem modeling and prediction gleaned from research on modeling, prediction, and decision-making in the atmospheric and earth sciences. The lessons are distilled from a series of case studies and placed into the specific context of examples from ecological science.

AB Indirect negative interactions between prey species that share a predator, referred to as apparent competition, have been modeled extensively. However, experimental studies examining the importance of apparent competition in the field are sparse, especially in plant-herbivore systems. In this study, I examined the role of a beetle herbivore, Ery-nephala maritima, in mediating the indirect effects of an abundant host plant, Salicornia europaea, on a less common host species, Atriplex patula var. hastata, in New England salt marshes. To examine these relationships, I manipulated plant density (plants with vs. without neighbors) and composition (conspecific neighbors vs. Salicornia neighbors) surrounding focal Atriplex plants, as well as the presence or absence of herbivores in a field experiment. Densities of both beetle eggs and larvae were significantly greater in plots with Salicornia, suggesting that its presence increases patch location or selection by herbivores. Higher insect densities resulted in significantly higher levels of herbivore damage to Atriplex within Salicornia-addition plots compared with high- and low-density Atriplex plots. Thus the identity, and not just density, of neighboring plants is important in determining levels of herbivory. Increased herbivore damage in Salicornia-addition plots resulted in a concomitant decrease in Atriplex survival and reproductive output. Furthermore, the negative effect of Salicornia on Atriplex survival and fruit production only occurred in the presence of herbivores, indicating that competitive effects are indirect rather than direct. Thus, Salicornia has a strong apparent competitive effect on Atriplex. Cross-site surveys suggested that the pattern of increased herbivore damage to Atriplex associated with increases in local Salicornia density is common and widespread. Overall, the results suggest that the apparent competitive effect of Salicornia is likely a major determinant of patterns of Atriplex abundance both between habitat patches and across marsh zones.

AB Variation in the spatial arrangement of plant tissue modifies the functional response of herbivores. In heterogeneous environments, this variation can occur at multiple spatial scales. We used likelihood-based approaches to examine the strength of evidence in data for models of herbivore functional response to spatial variation in plants. These models represented different hypotheses about plant characteristics controlling intake rate, including biomass, bite mass, plant density, and the composite effects of plant density and bite mass. Models were fit to observations of the food intake rate of elk (Cervus canadensis), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus), domestic rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), and lemmings (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus) feeding in plant patches where plant density and plant mass ranged over at least two orders of magnitude. The model representing composite effects of bite mass and plant density had more support in the data than any competing models (Akaike weight for the composite model > 0.999). Maximum-likelihood estimates of parameters in the composite model closely resembled independent, direct estimates, giving credence to the mechanisms represented by the model. The composite model portrayed a distance threshold (d*, in meters) distinguishing mechanisms regulating functional response. When plant spacing exceeded this threshold, intake rate was regulated by plant density. When the plant spacing was less than the threshold, intake rate was controlled by bite mass. Based on earlier work, we show that the threshold d* scales with body mass (M, in kilograms) as 7.1 M-0.06. This relationship illustrates that: (1) spatial pattern of plants at patch scales may influence intake rate only when plants occur at very low density; (2) herbivores of very different body mass respond to heterogeneity in a remarkably similar fashion; and (3) variation in leaf-scale characteristics controlling bite mass interact with plant spacing at patch scales to influence herbivore functional response.

AB Recruitment is an important determinant of fitness and population growth rates, but few studies have examined the effect of environmental stochasticity on this life history trait. Furthermore, most studies have been unable to separate the influence of juvenile survival and age-specific breeding proportions on recruitment. We used a recently developed approach. based on capture-mark-recapture methods, in which local recruitment is analyzed in a multistate model with an unobservable "nonbreeder" state. The data are drawn from a long-term study of a long-lived, arctic-nesting bird, the Greater Snow Goose (Chen caerulescens atlantica), and include marking and recaptures of female goslings and breeding adult females of unknown age between 1990 and 2000. The model considers four parameters: the probability that an individual aged i with no breeding experience starts breeding (a), juvenile and adult apparent survival (Phi), and capture probability of breeders (P). The flexibility achieved allows us to assess the influence of environmental conditions encountered during early life and at breeding on juvenile survival and the probabilities of starting to breed at a given age. Recruitment was a gradual process (probability of starting to breed at age 2 yr = 0.25 [95% CI, 0.12-0.45]; at age 3 yr = 0.57 [0.20-0.87]) and was completed by age 4 yr (i.e., all remaining immature females started to breed at that age). Juvenile survival was higher in early-hatched than in late-hatched females. Juvenile survival varied considerably among cohorts, but our environmental covariates could not explain these differences. Probabilities of starting to breed were less variable, except in lemming crash years, when they were considerably reduced. Snow cover at breeding or hatch date did not affect probabilities of starting to breed. These results suggest that environmental conditions can have an impact on life histories of birds in seasonal environments, but that variations in juvenile survival probably account for most of the fluctuation in the proportion of birds from a cohort that recruit into the breeding population. Use of multistate models to estimate recruitment increases precision in parameter estimates with the addition of data from adults of unknown age. However. we are still restricted by some assumptions, most notably the absence of temporary emigration.

AB Patterns in the spatial distribution of endemic species are central to setting conservation priorities and estimating extinction rates due to habitat loss. We use quantitative models to isolate the effects of relative species abundances and conspecific spatial distributions on the endemics-area relationship. Using published abundance data from a tropical rain forest community, we apply these models to illustrate how species abundance distributions and species spatial distributions have a strikingly different influence on total and endemic species diversity patterns, respectively. Increased dominance and conspecific aggregation in a region will act to decrease the total species diversity of smaller sampled subregions, but to increase subregional endemic species diversity. Our results suggest that biotic or abiotic forces contributing to regional-scale species dominance and conspecific clustering may increase the risk of extinctions under habitat loss.

AB Preference for nectar amino acids varies between different groups of pollinators. Females of several butterfly species have shown a clear preference for nectar mimics containing amino acids over nectar void of amino acids. This investigation examined how larval conditions affect nectar amino acid preferences of butterflies. Larvae of Araschnia levana were raised on low and high food quality diets. Female butterflies raised on the low quality larval diet were smaller and showed a significant preference for the nectar mimic with amino acids, whereas females raised on the high quality diet were larger and showed no preference. Larval food quality did not affect male mass, and male butterflies were indifferent to nectar amino acids. Consequently, female butterflies may compensate for poor larval nutrition by selectively feeding on nectar containing amino acids. These results demonstrate the nutritional plasticity of holometabolous insects and the potential evolutionary significance of nectar amino acids for both plants and their pollinators.

AB The number of seeds produced by a population of woody plants can vary markedly from year to year. Unfortunately, knowledge of the patterns and causes of crop-size variation is limited, and most studies have examined only single species in a single mesic environment. We examined long-term patterns of acorn crop sizes for five species of shrubby oaks in three xeric upland vegetative associations of south-central peninsular Florida for evidence of regular fruiting cycles and in relation to winter temperature and precipitation. Counts of acorns on two white oak species (Quercus chapmanii and Q. geminata) and three red oak species (Q. inopina, Q. laevis, and Q. myrtifolia) were,conducted annually from 1969 to 1996 (except in 1991) on grids in southern ridge sandhill, sand pine scrub, and scrubby flatwoods associations. As the result of the dissimilar timing of reproductive events in species of red and white oaks and individual species responses to climatic variables, annual acorn production of red and white oak species in a given vegetation association were not synchronized, which dampened the variability of combined annual acorn production. Consequently, acorns,were produced with reasonable abundance every year by at least one species. Oaks of nearly closed-canopy scrub produced fewer acorns than similar-sized oaks of the same species in the more open-canopied sandhill and scrubby flatwoods, suggesting light. limitation. We identified regular cycles of acorn production that ranged from 2 to 2.4 yr for white oak species and from 3.6 to 5.5 yr for red oak species and found evidence that annual acorn production is affected by the interactions of precipitation, which is highly variable Seasonally and annually in peninsular Florida, with reproductive patterns. Multiple regression models using precipitation variables accounted for as much as 74% of crop-size variation in Q. inopina, 65% in Q. laevis, 60% in Q. chapmanii, and 44% in Q. geminata, but only 29% for Q. myrtifolia. In contrast, acorn production showed no significant association with-minimum winter temperatures. Of the various hypotheses offered to explain supra-annual variation in seed crops, our, data are most compatible with the nonadaptive resource-matching hypothesis.

AB Long-distance dispersal has many consequences. One of these is the speed with which a population can invade a new habitat. This invasion wave speed can be calculated from information on demography (in the form of a stage-structured matrix population model) and dispersal,(in the form,of a distribution of stage-specific dispersal distances). Wave speed complements population growth rate (lambda) as an index of population performance in conservation biology. Here we present a new. way to calculate the sensitivity of wave speed to changes in short- and long distance dispersal-indeed, to dispersal at any distance-using the order statistics of the dispersal distribution. This makes it possible to examine the effects of changing the distance dispersed by the longest-dispersing individual, the shortest, the median individual, etc. We apply the method to data on the Pied Flycatcher in the Netherlands, the Starling in the United States, and-the Sparrowhawk in England and the Netherlands. We find that wave speed is vastly,more sensitive to changes in the uppermost percentiles of the dispersal distribution than to changes elsewhere. The sensitivity results make it possible to carry out life table response experiment (LTRE) calculations, which quantify the contribution of demography, short-distance dispersal, and long-distance dispersal to interpopulation differences in wave speed. We find that 30% of the difference in wave speed between the Pied Flycatcher and the Starling is due to demography and about 70% to dispersal. Most of the dispersal effects come from the top 10% of the dispersal distribution. In contrast, 86% of the difference in wave speed between the two populations of Sparrowhawks is due to differences in demography, and about 14% to differences in dispersal. Again, most of the dispersal effects are due to the upper percentiles of the dispersal distribution. The patterns revealed in the analysis of the four populations are very similar, suggesting that the dependence of wave speed on long-distance dispersal may exhibit common patterns of sensitivity and elasticity.

AB At a landscape scale, the combined influence of biotic and abiotic factors may determine the distribution patterns of large herbivores in African savanna ecosystems. Herbivores foraging in these ecosystems may become nutritionally stressed during an annual dry season when both forage quality and quantity are reduced. Additionally, the locations of water sources may impose a landscape-scale constraint on dry-season herbivore distributions. We used logistic regression to analyze 13 years of aerial census data collected in the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, and evaluated hypotheses regarding the relative influences that surface water, forage quality, and forage quantity exert on the dry-season, landscape-scale distribution patterns of eight herbivore species, Hypotheses regarding the degree of correlation between species' distributions and distance to water were developed using previous observations of species' relative water dependence. We also developed hypotheses regarding species' responses to the trade-off that may occur between surface-water constraints and nutritional requirements when either forage quality or quantity is reduced. In general, we expect an increase in species' mean distance to water as a result of individuals mitigating limitations in nutritional requirements (i.e., intake quality or quantity) by foraging farther from water. Our analyses, suggest that the trade-off between nutritional requirements and surface-water constraints that species ace varies according to the species' water dependence, size, and gut morphology. Of the four grazers considered in our analyses, waterbuck. distributions appear to be constrained primarily by surface-water availability. Distributions of buffalo, a large ruminant grazer, suggest that individuals face a trade-off between nutritional requirements and surface-water constraints when forage quantity is reduced.. Alternatively, distributions of wildebeest, a-smaller ruminant grazer, suggest that individuals face this' trade-off when access-to high-quality forage is limited. In comparison to buffalo and, wildebeest, the strength of this trade-off is moderate for zebra, a nonruminant similar in size to wildebeest, when either forage quality or quantity is reduced. Distribution patterns for browsers are characterized by a weak relationship with distance to Water, as expected for these relatively water-independent species. Population densities relative to forage quality confound exploration of this trade-off for mixed feeders.

AB This research used a model experimental system to explore the joint effects of resource fragmentation and resource deterioration on population dynamics. The system provides a rapid test of conservation theory and can aid in planning for large and expensive studies. The investigation subjected the sawtooth grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.), to five experiments in which population abundance was monitored over time. Metapopulations were created by connecting adjacent vials of flour. with rubber tubes. The metapopulations were arranged in rings, and food was replenished at two-week, intervals. The experiments examined populations in (1) habitats becoming increasingly fragmented, (2) dynamically fragmenting structure with concurrent loss of resources over time, (3) static structure, dynamic resource loss and differing numbers of patches, (4) static structural arrangements with dynamic resource loss that mimic resource deterioration and destruction, and (5) static arrangements of connected fragments with an equal total amount of food in a few large patches or several Small patches. Time series of stage-specific abundances were compared in repeated.-measures ANOVA. The results show that populations respond in nonlinear ways to both the amount of food and area provided. Within a confined area, when food is plentiful, individual interaction limits population abundance. When the amount of food is reduced,. population abundance becomes food dependent. Immediate increase in immature abundance was a characteristic. of fragmentation while a delayed reduction of adults was characteristic of food reduction. The stage-specific interaction at intermediate food levels shows birth and death processes that control this system, and elucidates the relationship between area and food that is, integral to the dynamics of patchy populations.

AB We investigated interindividual variation and intra-individual phenotypic flexibility in basal metabolic rate (BMR), total evaporative water loss (TEWL), body temperature (T-b), the minimum dry heat transfer coefficient (h), and organ and muscle size of five species of larks geographically distributed along an aridity gradient. We exposed all species to constant environments of 15degreesC or 35degreesC, and examined to what extent interspecific differences in physiology can be attributed to acclimation. We tested the hypothesis that birds from deserts display larger intra-individual phenotypic flexibility and smaller intern individual variation than species from mesic areas.
   Larks from arid areas had lower BMR, TEWL, and h, but did not have internal organ, sizes different from birds from mesic habitats. BMR of 15degreesC-acclimated birds was 18.0%, 29.1%, 12.2%, 25.3%, and 4.7% higher than of 35degreesC-acclimated Hoopoe Larks, Dunn's Larks, Spike-heeled Larks, Skylarks, and Woodlarks, respectively. TEWL of 15degreesC-acclimated Hoopoe Larks exceeded values for 35degreesC-acclimated individuals by 23% but did not differ between 15degreesC- and 35degreesC-acclimated individuals in the other species. The dry heat transfer coefficient was increased in 15degreesC-acclimated individuals of Skylarks and Dunn's Larks, but not in the. other species. Body temperature was on average 0.4degreesC +/- 0.15degreesC (mean +/- 1 SEM) lower in 15degreesC-acclimated individuals of all species. Increased food intake in 15degreesC-acclimated birds stimulated enlargement of intestine (26.9-38.6%), kidneys (9.8-24.4%), liver (16.5-27.2%), and. stomach (22.0-31.6%). The pectoral muscle increased in 15degreesC-acclimated Spike-heeled Larks and Skylarks, remained unchanged in Hoopoe Larks, and decreased in 15degreesC-acclimated Woodlarks and Dunn's Larks. We conclude that the degree of intra-individual flexibility varied between physiological traits and among species, but that acclimation does not account for interspecific differences in BMR, TEWL, and h in larks. We found no general support for the hypothesis that species from desert environments display larger intra-individual phenotypic flexibility than those from mesic areas.
   The coefficient of variation of larks acclimated to their natural environment was smaller in species from and areas than in species from mesic areas for mass-corrected BMR and surface-specific h, but not for mass-corrected TEWL. The high repeatabilities of BMR, TEWL, and h in several species indicated a within-individual consistency on which natural selection could operate.

AB Causes of natal dispersal were studied in an isolated population of the migratory, facultatively colonial Lesser Kestrel (Falco naumanni) in northeastern Spain. Dur During a seven-year study, we gathered information on natal dispersal of 751 individuals and on 24 explanatory variables that evaluated individual traits, conspecific cues in terms of colony size, and different ecological and populational features. We examined separately whether or not individuals changed colonies and how far they moved. Dispersal from the natal colony was high (83%), and dispersers covered a median distance-of 7225 In (range 112-136500 m). The probability of natal dispersal decreased with the size of the natal colony and with the distance to the nearest colony, but not with the distance to unoccupied buildings, in the year of recruitment. Moreover, the shorter the distance to the nearest colony, the shorter the distances that individuals dispersed, particularly to large colonies (>10 pairs). These results support the conspecific attraction hypothesis. Accordingly, the probability of recruiting in-the natal colony increased with the proportion of philopatric adults, although beyond a threshold individuals were prevented from recruiting by the more dominant adults in a despotic way. The timing of arrival from the wintering grounds was positively related to the probability of colony change, especially in males. To the extent that this variable is related to the phenotypic quality of individuals, it reinforces the idea that natal dispersal is shaped by intraspecific competition in crowded colonies. Males showed lower frequencies of colony change and dispersed shorter distances than did females, as explained by the different role of the sexes in nest acquisition and defense. Our results indicate that natal dispersal is an evolutionarily labile trait simultaneously influenced by ecological, social, and individual features both within and between populations.

AB The dominant models explaining tree species diversity and distribution patterns in tropical forests are the Janzen-Connell and Recruitment Limitation models, neither of which considers the effect of long-distance geed dispersal on seed survival, seedling establishment, or the aggregated distributions of trees empirically observed at mesoscales in tropical forests. At a neotropical forest site (Maraca Island Ecological Reserve, Roraima, Brazil), we experimentally reproduced long-distance clumped seed dispersal by tapirs for the palm Maximiliana maripa. Such dispersal protects seeds from attack by species-specific bruchid beetles by. (1) covering them in protective fecal material and (2) placing them in sites distant from conspecific adult tree aggregations, where beetles are less active. Endocarps distant from parent patches survived bruchid attack at a significantly higher rate than those in parent patches, as did in-feces endocarps compared to clean endocarps. A significant interaction effect between distance from patches. and feces treatment showed that feces conferred protection to seeds within a parent patch but did not appear to confer additional protection to seeds already protected by distance from the parent patch. A mesoscale map compiled from aerial photography, satellite imagery, and air- and ground-truthing revealed an aggregated pattern of M. maripa palms associated with tapir latrine sites, supporting the view that long-distance seed dispersal by tapirs is responsible for the generation of palm patches and potentially important in forest-savanna boundary dynamics. We conclude that seed shadows and survival rates can justifiably be studied at the scale of tree aggregations rather than at the scale of individual trees, and that long-distance Seed dispersal is neither rare nor unpredictable once we understand the movements and behavior of large, mobile animals.

AB It has been argued that nonstandard mechanisms of dispersal are often responsible for long-distance dispersal in plants. For example, plant seeds that appear to be adapted for wind dispersal may occasionally be dispersed long distances by birds, or vice versa. In this paper, we explore whether existing data on dispersal distances, colonization rates, and migration rates support the idea that dispersal processes suggested by the morphology of the dispersal unit are responsible for long distance dispersal. We conclude that the relationship between morphologically defined dispersal syndrome and long-distance dispersal is poor. This relationship is poor because the relationship between the morphology of dispersal units and the multiple processes that move seeds are often complex. We argue that understanding gleaned from the often anecdotal literature on nonstandard and standard means of long distance dispersal is the foundation for both statistical and mechanistic models of long-distance dispersal. Such models hold exciting promise for the development of a quantitative ecology of long-distance dispersal.

AB Plant roots play diverse roles in the rhizosphere. They function as organs responsible for structural support, for acquisition of mineral and water resources, and for fostering of symbiotic bacteria and fungi. They also sustain a complex food web of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in, on, and near the root. In addition to these well-known functions, roots have a recently discovered role with potentially profound coevolutionary implications for the rhizosphere food web, as well as for terrestrial ecological communities in general. Roots are both a source and a receptor of molecular signals important for mutualistic bacteria and perhaps other soil organisms. Fluid-borne rhizosphere compounds flow in the opposite direction from airborne signals that emanate from plant shoots. The powerful transpiration stream around roots naturally concentrates molecular data in a cafeteria of information about the surrounding soil. These molecular signals, such as N-acylated homoserine lactones and phenazines produced by bacteria, can be interpreted simultaneously by multiple species as well as by the root. We propose a model of multitrophic molecular signals in the rhizosphere that implies multiple roles of roots, as hosts, regulators, and sustainers of terrestrial productivity. We suggest a framework of regulation in the rhizosphere that functions through molecular "control points." We define control points as regulatory elements that are operated on by selection processes to confer fitness on individual organisms and thereby have effects that propagate through other trophic levels. Identification of a control point creates a hypothesis that can be tested to assess the quantitative significance of that regulatory element. Some control points may transmit or perceive signals between organisms, but others probably integrate changing environmental conditions or external resources into individual life histories and community functions. The promise of understanding the new molecular signals is that genes must closely underlie these control points. This could offer ecology access to the power of molecular biology and allow a deep understanding of the evolutionary significance of these phenomena. One major strength of rhizospheres for addressing these issues is that realistic ecological interactions can be examined in a restricted microcosm under environmentally controlled conditions with organisms whose genomes have been completely defined and/or partially modified.

AB Large fires in chaparral-dominated shrublands of southern and central California are widely attributed to decades of fire suppression. Prehistoric shrubland landscapes are hypothesized to have exhibited fine-grained age-patch mosaics in which fire spread was limited by the age and spatial pattern of fuels. In contrast, I hypothesize that fires during extreme weather conditions have been capable of burning through all age classes of the vegetation mosaic. Using the mapped fire history (1911-1995) of Los Padres National Forest, I analyzed burning patterns for hundreds of fires using a geographic information system (GIS). To estimate the degree of age dependency exhibited by the fire regime at different spatial scales, I employed methods of fire frequency analysis (i.e., fitting a generalized Weibull function to fire interval distributions). Statistics were also calculated using a temporal breakpoint of 1950 to assess possible effects of suppression. Results indicated that shrubland fires have frequently burned through young age classes of vegetation, exhibiting a minimal degree of age dependency. Findings were not scale dependent and were consistent for all but one region of the study area. The anomalous region exhibited a more rapid increase in the hazard of burning with fuel age, reflecting a moderately age-dependent fire regime; this difference probably resulted from the fact that the region is somewhat sheltered from extreme fire weather that commonly affects other shrublands. Exposure to extreme fire weather therefore appears to override the sensitivity of a fire regime to fuels characteristics at the landscape scale. Fire suppression has affected characteristics of smaller fires much more than those of larger fires. Since 1950, there has been a decrease in size and an increase in the number of smaller fires. Findings support the claim that fire suppression-could offset ecological risks posed by increasingly frequent human-caused fires in specific areas, but with a net decrease in annual burning rate of similar to14% across the landscape. Findings contradict the assertion that, in the absence of fire suppression, large fires would be constrained by more complex age-patch mosaics on the landscape.

AB Nest predation has been hypothesized as a major factor influencing clutch size in birds. Indirect and correlative evidence for clutch size reduction under high nest predation risk is accumulating, but such a reduction has never been shown experimentally. We experimentally tested this "nest predation hypothesis" by manipulating nest predation rate in the Collared Flycatcher, Ficedula albicollis. As predicted, clutch size decreased in the year following the experiment in "depredated" areas (in which 20-35% of the nests were totally depredated) compared to control ones (no predation). This could result from (1) phenotypic plasticity in clutch size, or (2) differential breeding habitat selection, with dominant individuals or individuals laying large clutches preferentially leaving depredated areas and settling in control ones. There was no evidence for differential dispersal from areas of the two treatments, nor differential competitive abilities of breeders in areas of the two treatments. Conversely, all individuals had a smaller clutch size in depredated areas, supporting the hypothesis of clutch size plasticity. These results provide experimental support for the nest predation hypothesis of clutch size variation in birds and suggest the importance of information available to individual birds on local nest predation risk and previous experience for determining clutch size.

AB Arabidopsis thaliana and some of its close allies have been a model system for genetics, developmental biology, and molecular biology for some time. More recently, they have been adopted by an increasing number of laboratories involved in evolutionary ecological research. In this paper, I illustrate some of the methods and advantages concerning the use of Arabidopsis to study selection and the constraints imposed on it by the genetic architecture underlying morphological and life history traits. Populations of A. thaliana and closely related species show a wider ecological,variance than had been suspected, and it is increasingly clear that even such a relatively simple organism presents endless challenges to ecologists and evolutionary biologists. The study of the evolution of life history traits in this group also provides us with an invaluable opportunity to advance our search for ways to integrate biological knowledge at the organismal and molecular levels. At,the same time, these efforts also yield a better understanding of the type of research that can be carried out independently at these two levels of the biological hierarchy.

AB As nonindigenous species continue to displace native species and disrupt ecosystems, understanding the degree to which native species richness affects the vulnerability of communities to nonindigenous species invasions has grown in importance. Native and exotic species diversity are often positively correlated in large-scale observational studies, but negatively correlated in small-scale experimental studies. This discrepancy suggests that the scale of invasion studies may be an important influence on their outcomes. Using a competition-based model that exhibits a negative relationship on a small scale, we show that changes in the number of available resources across communities can cause invasion success to become positively correlated with native species diversity at larger scales. The strength of the positive correlation, however, depends on the relationship between niche breadth and species diversity in natural communities. Adding species to a community or removing resources has a similar effect-increasing the sum of interspecific interaction strengths, which decreases invasion success.

AB Many standard statistical models used to examine population dynamics ignore significant sources of stochasticity. Usually only process error is included, and uncertainty due to errors in data collection is omitted or not directly specified in the model. We show how standard time-series models for population dynamics can be extended to include both observational and process error and how to perform inference on parameters in these models in the Bayesian setting. Using simulated data, we show how ignoring observation error can be misleading. We argue that the standard Bayesian techniques used to perform inference, including freely available software, are generally applicable to a variety of time-series models.

AB The importance of density-mediated indirect effects (e.g., keystone predators) in marine communities has been widely recognized. Behaviorally mediated indirect interactions (BMIIs) may be equally important in marine systems, but have received relatively little attention. BMIIs occur when a change in an "initiator" species causes a behavioral shift in a "transmitter" species that, in turn, affects a "receiver" species. BMIIs between initiator and receiver species can be described by the ecological relationships between initiator and transmitter, and between transmitter and receiver (i.e., predator and prey, competitors, or no relationship), and the nature of the indirect effect on the receiver (i.e., positive or negative). We review published examples of BMIIs in marine communities, showing that BMIIs may create, enhance, ameliorate, or even reverse the sign of the direct interactions between species. Models that only include direct interactions or density-mediated indirect ones cannot predict some of these effects. BMIIs are likely to be ubiquitous in marine communities and have important implications for both understanding community dynamics and managing these systems. A thorough understanding of BMIIs is particularly important for conservation and management, as humans may play the role of an initiator, transmitter, or receiver of these effects in a variety of marine communities.

AB Ecologists have traditionally neglected demographic stochasticity in describing the spread of an invading species. However, the region most critical in determining wave speed is often the leading edge, precisely the point where demographic stochasticity is most pronounced. In this paper, I analyze a common class of one-dimensional, single-species invasion models and find that, for very general conditions, demographic stochasticity slows biological invasions. Nonetheless, the slowing is not large enough to be noticeable in most ecological time series. 1 also briefly discuss the role of transient dynamics and rare, long-distance dispersal.

AB Many attempts have been made to link invasions of exotic plants to specific plant traits and key attributes of invaded ecosystems. While these factors play a role in determining the potential for invasion. they are often inadequate in predicting the Success of a specific invasion. We show that interactions of an invasive grass with other members of the community determine the local pattern of invasion. A fungus, Ulocladium atrum, aids the establishment of barbed goatgrass (Aegilops triuncialis) by weakening the grass's tough seed head. thereby accelerating germination and seedling establishment. In contrast, gophers. Thomomys bottae, decrease establishment of this invader by selectively burying patches of goatgrass seedlings under mounds. Plants that survive these gopher disturbance produce seeds that are uninfected by Ulocladium atrum, which may further decrease the establishment of the next generation of goatgrass. A field survey indicated that goatgrass achieves dominance in areas with minimal gopher disturbance. but has limited establishment in pastures with high gopher activity, indicating that the landscape pattern of gopher activity influences patterns of goatgrass invasion by manipulating gopher-plant-fungal interactions.

AB To predict how species establish and disperse within novel communities, the spatial scale at which competition, predation, and habitat interact must be understood. We explored how these factors affect the distribution and abundance of the exotic crayfishes Orconectes rusticus and O. propinquus and the native O. virilis at both the site-specific and whole-lake scales in northern Wisconsin lakes. During summer 1990, we quantified crayfish, fish predators, and fish diets in cobble and macrophyte sites in Trout Lake, comparing resulting patterns to those in 21 lakes surveyed during summer 1987. Within and across lakes, fish abundance was unrelated to habitat. Within Trout Lake, O. rusticus and O. propinquus were common in both cobble and macrophyte. Orconectes virilis was restricted to macrophyte, probably due to strong displacement by the invaders in cobble. Across lakes, O. rusticus increased where habitat was more than 16.7% cobble, O. propinquus was generally rare, and O. virilis abundance was unrelated to cobble. Crayfish were generally small in cobble and large in macrophyte, perhaps because of habitat-specific, size-selective fish predation or because large crayfish leave cobble when it no longer provides refuge. Orconectes virilis, the largest of three congeners, may have a size refuge in macrophyte but not in. cobble. Across lakes, O. rusticus was only abundant when fish biomass was low; O. virilis abundance varied positively with fish.
   Effects of fish predation and habitat on the ability of invaders Orconectes rusticus and O. propinquus to establish and replace O. virilis appear to be scale dependent. At local (site-specific) scales, cobble likely interacts with selective predation for O. virilis to allow the invaders to establish and replace the native. At the lake-wide scale, high cobble facilitates invaders but predation may curb their successful dispersal and establishment at new sites. Models of community assembly and invasions need to incorporate scale dependencies in habitat availability and biotic interactions to effectively assess the invasion potential of novel species.

AB The study of animal movement and behavior is being revolutionized by technology, such as satellite tags and harmonic radar, that allows us to track the movements of individual animals. However, our ability to analyze and model such data has lagged behind the sophisticated collection methods. We review problems with current methods and suggest a more powerful and flexible approach, state-space modeling, and we illustrate how these models can be posed in a meta-analytic framework so that information from individual trajectories may be combined optimally. State-space models enable us to deal with the complexity of modeling animals interacting with their environment but, unlike other methods, they allow simultaneous estimation of measurement error and process noise that are inherent in animal-trajectory data. A Bayesian framework allows us to incorporate important prior information when available and also allows meta-analytic techniques to be incorporated in a straightforward fashion. Meta-analysis enables both individual and broader-level inference from observations of multiple individual pathways. Our approach is powerful because it allows researchers to test hypotheses regarding animal movement, to connect theoretical models to data, and to use modern likelihood-based estimation techniques, all under a single statistical framework.

AB Pollinator unpredictability favors evolutionary shifts from outcrossing to autonomous selfing, which provides reproductive assurance. Our goal was to quantify the reproductive assurance benefit of autonomous selfing and the stochastic nature of pollinator-mediated pollen receipt using three wild populations of the annual species Collinsia verna (Scrophulariaceae) over three years. The timing of autonomous self-pollination in C. verna ranges from competing to delayed, with more than half of the autonomous pollen arriving late in floral life. Floral density, identity of insect floral visitors, and visitation rate varied within and among years, with significant variation in pollinator community between years within populations. Pollinator failure reduced fruit set within and among populations across years. However, reproductive assurance selfing increased fruit set on average by 8% overall and up to 30% in one population. Despite this fitness benefit, fruit set (= Sigmafruits/Sigmaflowers) estimated in pollinator-exclusion cages was significantly less than the fruit set in paired open-pollinated plots. In a series of experiments, we found no difference in fruit set from self- vs. outcross pollen, ruling out early inbreeding depression. However, flowers, hand-outcrossed at the same time that autonomous selfing naturally occurs, produced significantly more fruits relative to flowers that received pollen only through autonomous selfing. These results suggest that pollen type (self/outcross) is less important to fruiting success than is the timing or efficiency of autonomous pollination relative to vector-mediated pollination. Our results support the reproductive assurance hypothesis and suggest that autonomous selfing in C. verna is adaptive under variable pollinator conditions. Fruit set results from both pollinator-delivered and autonomous self-pollen, suggesting a "best of both worlds" scenario, with mixed mating a likely outcome.

AB Distinguishing the mechanisms responsible for the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem services requires knowledge of (1) the functional roles played by individual species and (2) the sequence with which species are added to or lost from communities in nature (i.e., "community assembly" and "community disassembly," respectively). Rarely, if ever, are both these issues understood with certainty in any given ecosystem. We used an empirically based simulation model to assess the degree to which the sequence of species loss from vertebrate communities influences risk of human exposure to Lyme disease, as measured by the proportion of ticks infected with the etiological agent. Dramatic differences in the shapes of the curves relating vertebrate biodiversity to disease risk (which we consider an ecosystem service) were observed. Randomized sequences of species loss resulted in a decrease in disease risk with reduced biodiversity, a result that is contradicted by both empirical observations and model results from nonrandomized sequences of species loss (i.e., specific "disassembly rules"). All potentially realistic disassembly rules resulted in increases in disease risk with decreasing biodiversity, although shapes of the curves varied considerably. Our results highlight the importance of both species identity and the order by which species are lost, in understanding the mechanisms by which biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning.

AB Increasing habitat fragmentation has led population ecologists to consider dispersal as a key process for population functioning and persistence. However, due to logistic and methodological problems, dispersal rates within fragmented populations have rarely been estimated, leaving many unanswered questions about the role of dispersal and the factors affecting dispersal.
   Recently developed multistrata capture-recapture models allow the estimation of dispersal probabilities from the analysis of recaptures or recoveries of marked individuals. Despite their undoubted efficiency at estimating dispersal rates, their contribution to the investigation of dispersal processes at the individual level is presently limited by a lack of flexibility in their parameterization. In this paper, a new parameterization of these models is presented in which the probability of leaving the site of origin and the probability that an emigrant settles on a given recipient site are modeled separately.
   This parameterization is then used to address the influence of local perturbations on site fidelity and settlement decisions of emigrants in a subdivided population of Black-headed Gulls, Larus ridibundus.
   The parameterization introduced here accurately describes dispersal probabilities whenever they result from a two-step decision-making process (i.e., when choice of a settlement site only occurs after a decision has been made to leave the current site). Furthermore, this parameterization permits investigators to disentangle hypotheses about these two components of dispersal behavior.

AB Agricultural expansion has resulted in loss of natural habitats worldwide, threatening remnant populations and communities. However, during the past several centuries in much of Europe and eastern North America, extensive forest clearance (usually resulting in <20% forest cover) has been followed by widespread expansion of forest onto abandoned agricultural land. Since ancient forests (those remaining at the peak of forest loss) provide seed sources for recolonization of recent (post-agricultural) forests, the extent of forest loss should influence the rate of population recovery in recent forest. Data compiled from the literature for 10 regions of Europe and North America indicate that the proportion of ancient forest in a landscape can account for >65% of the variation in species diversity of "ancient forest herbs" in recent forests relative to ancient forests. This result suggests that ancient-forest loss has had a strong influence on the recovery of herbaceous plant diversity in post-agricultural forests. In addition, a simple mainland-island metapopulation model suggests that with increasing severity of habitat loss the return time to equilibrium patch occupancy in recent forests is greatly extended, perhaps for centuries after forest clearance has ceased and restoration begun.

AB Mostly indirect evidence has shown that the size of bird colonies is often related positively to the size of foraging areas, in turn an indirect measure of prey availability. We report here results of an unusual opportunity to directly investigate the relationships among the size and distribution of colonies of Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), the degree of overlap of colony-specific foraging areas, and the availability of kittiwake prey, principally Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) and sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus), in Prince William Sound, Alaska, 1995-1999. Aerial surveys to assess prevalence of prey schools visible at the surface (the kittiwake mode of prey search) allowed quantification of prey availability in foraging areas. Foraging areas and foraging ranges were determined by radio telemetry. Large colonies occurred as far apart as physically possible and not within foraging range (similar to40 km) of one another; only small colonies occurred within the respective ranges of large colonies. Foraging range, foraging trip duration, and area of foraging grounds were related positively to colony size. Down to the finest scale (1.5-nautical miles, or 2.8 km), the presence-absence of foraging kittiwakes was related to where prey schools were likely to occur, rather than there being a direct relationship between densities of kittiwakes and observed prey schools. Annual variation in school density did not alter the relationship between colony size and size of foraging grounds, i.e., more abundant prey did not reduce the size of the foraging ground. Importantly, the quality of foraging grounds (prevalence of fish schools at the surface) decreased with colony size. We conclude that the density of foraging kittiwakes within Prince William Sound has reached a limit: additional birds would compromise access to prey, probably by passive foraging interference. This pattern would explain why overall numbers of breeding kittiwakes in the Sound have remained relatively stable during the past few decades, whereas several colonies have dramatically increased in size and others have decreased or disappeared.

AB Human disturbance in northeastern North America over the past four centuries has led to dramatic change in vegetation composition and ecosystem processes, obscuring the influence of climate and edaphic factors on vegetation patterns. We use a paleoecological approach on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to assess landscape-scale variation in pitch pine-oak vegetation and fire occurrence on the pre-European landscape and to determine changes resulting from European land use. Fossil pollen and charcoal preserved in seven lakes confirm a close link between landform and the pre-European distribution of vegetation. Pine forests, dominated by Pinus rigida, were closely associated with xeric outwash deposits, whereas oak-hardwood forests were associated with landforms having finer grained soils and variable topography. In general, fire was much more abundant on Cape Cod than most other areas in New England, but its occurrence varied geographically at two scales. On the western end of Cape Cod, fires were more prevalent in pine forests (outwash) than in oak-hardwood forests (moraines). In contrast, fires were less common on the narrow and north-south trending eastern Cape, perhaps because of physical limits on fire spread.
   The most rapid and substantial changes during the past 2000 years were initiated by European settlement, which produced a vegetation mosaic that today is less clearly tied to landform: Quercus and other hardwood trees declined in abundance in the early settlement period in association with land clearance, whereas Pinus has increased, especially during the past century, through natural reforestation and planting of abandoned fields and pastures. An increase in fossil charcoal following European settlement suggests that fire occurrence has risen substantially as a result of forest clearance and other land uses, reaching levels greater than at any time over the past 2000 years. Although fire was undoubtedly used by Native Americans and may have been locally important, we find no clear evidence that humans extensively modified fire regimes or vegetation before European settlement. Instead, climate change over the past several thousand years and European land use over the past 300 years have been the most important agents of change on this landscape.

AB A flexible method is needed for constrained ordination on the basis of any distance or dissimilarity measure, which will display a cloud of multivariate points by reference to a specific a priori hypothesis. We suggest the use of principal coordinate analysis (PCO, metric MDS), followed by either a canonical discriminant analysis (CDA, when the hypothesis concerns groups) or a canonical correlation analysis (CCorA, when the hypothesis concerns relationships with environmental or other variables), to provide a flexible and meaningful constrained ordination of ecological species abundance data. Called "CAP" for "Canonical Analysis of Principal coordinates," this method will allow a constrained ordination to be done on the basis of any distance or dissimilarity measure. We describe CAP in detail, including how it can uncover patterns that are masked in an unconstrained MDS ordination. Canonical tests using permutations are also given, and we show how the method can be used (1) to place a new observation into the canonical space using only interpoint dissimilarities, (2) to classify observations and obtain misclassification or residual errors, and (3) to correlate the original variables with patterns on canonical plots. Misclassification error or residual error is used to obtain a non-arbitrary decision concerning the appropriate dimensionality of the response data cloud (number of PCO axes) for the ensuing canonical analysis. We suggest that a CAP ordination and an unconstrained ordination, such as MDS, together will provide important information for meaningful multivariate analyses of ecological data by reference to explicit a priori hypotheses.

AB Quantifying habitat use is vital to understanding animal ecology. Herein, we contrast classification-based (i.e., animal locations are placed into habitat categories for subsequent analyses) and distance-based (i.e., distance between animal locations and habitat features are used in subsequent analyses) approaches for analyzing habitat use data. Compositional analysis (CA) and a distance-based analysis (DA) were used to quantify habitat selection of Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). We qualitatively compared the outcome of these different procedures to illustrate advantages of the DA approach. The DA approach identified edges as an important habitat feature, and location error did not alter conclusions from DA. In contrast, CA did not detect the importance of edge, and presence of location errors altered conclusions. Moreover, modeling the distribution of location error did not effectively reduce sensitivity to error within CA. Distance-based approaches to habitat analyses are not restricted to linear or point habitat features, require no explicit error handling, and permit extraction of more information from the data than classification-based analyses alone.

AB A major goal of insect community ecology is to understand how and why herbivorous insect species vary in the diversity of their parasitoid assemblages and the rates of parasitism that they experience. Most studies investigating these issues with Lepidoptera as hosts have relied on literature records of parasitoid-host associations that are. often of limited quality and that do not necessarily reflect local interactions between hosts and parasitoids. We sampled externally feeding Lepidoptera in mesquite-oak savanna habitats of southeastern Arizona (USA) to assess the ecological and evolutionary determinants of parasitoid community structure. We focused on parasitoids in the family Tachinidae (Diptera) due to their dominance as larval parasitoids of macrolepidoptera at our site. Host abundance, morphology, coloration, gregariousness, and diet breadth of the host were all significantly correlated with tachinid species richness among hosts. Tachinid species richness also varied according to host taxonomy (family), but most of this variation appeared to be better explained by morphology and ecology than by phylogenetic position. Characteristics of host habitat and body size had no significant effect on tachinid species richness. Tachinid parasitism rates were higher for abundant, hairy, non-aposematic, and gregarious hosts. Hymenopteran parasitism rates were low and Variable with, only host family explaining a significant amount of variation. In general, we found that a substantial amount of the variation in tachinid species richness and parasitism rates among hosts can be,explained by ecological attributes, and that interactions of host species with their host plants and predators may determine their suitability as hosts for parasitoids.

AB Many Antarctic seabirds depend on prey that are patchy, cryptic, ephemeral, and unpredictable in location. These predators typically employ two alternative behavioral strategies for locating resource patches: direct visual or olfactory detection, and indirect detection (local enhancement) by sighting other predators that are already exploiting a patch. We developed a model of direct detection and local enhancement in seabirds that predicts how foraging success varies with behavioral strategy, seabird densities, and prey swarm density and detectability. Application of the model to Black-browed Albatrosses foraging for Antarctic krill near South Georgia suggests that local enhancement is generally a highly effective foraging strategy, and that the fraction of time albatrosses spend in feeding flocks should show strong interactions between prey and conspecific densities. To test these predictions, we analyzed survey data collected near South Georgia in January-March 1986. Our analysis suggests a strong Allee-type density dependence in foraging success that was qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with model predictions. This density dependence suggests a potential for destabilizing patterns of resource utilization and reproductive success in Black-browed Albatrosses that may have important implications for conservation of albatrosses and other Antarctic species.

AB The density-dependence inherent in population interactions can be undermined when the behavior or distribution of predators is not predictable from their population density. For instance, unequal use of space by consumers can lead to improper characterizations of their interaction with prey if based solely on population density. Instead, quitting harvest rates (QHRs) from resource patches might provide a useful alternative index of predator impacts. We tested whether space use would predict predation rates of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) on experimental songbird nests and whether QHRs or mouse density would best predict the proportion of space used. Our results indicated that space use was an accurate predictor of nest predation rates. Moreover, space use was significantly related to QHRs, but not to mouse density. In our study, space use is the outcome of behavioral mechanisms that do not appear to scale with or lag behind consumer density. In such cases, we may expect a disjuncture between population density and species interactions.

AB Recent literature on plant population spread advocates quantification of long-distance dispersal (LDD). These estimates could provide insights into rates of migration in response to climate change and rates of alien invasions. LDD information is not available for parameterization of current models because it is hard to obtain. We combine a new stochastic model with a flexible framework that permits assimilation of evidence that might be derived from a range of sources. Results are consistent with the prediction of traditional diffusion that population spread has a finite asymptotic velocity. Unlike traditional diffusion, spread is not well described by the mean; it is erratic.
   In contrast with deterministic models, our results show that inherent uncertainty, rather than parameter sensitivity, thwarts informative forecasts of spread velocity. Analysis shows that, because LDD is inherently unpredictable, even full knowledge of LDD parameters might not provide informative estimates of velocity for populations characterized by LDD. Although predictive distributions are too broad to provide precise estimates of spread rate, they are valuable for comparing spread potential among species and for identifying potential for invasion.
   Using combinations of dispersal data and the estimates provided by dispersal biologists that derive from multiple sources, the model predicts spread rates that are much slower than those from traditional (deterministic) fat-tailed models and from simulation models of spread, but for different reasons. Deterministic fat-tailed models overestimate spread rate, because they assume that fractions of individuals can rapidly occupy distant sites. Stochastic models recognize that distant colonization is limited to discrete individuals. Stochastic simulations of plant migration overestimate migration of trees, because they typically assume values of R-0 that are too large.

AB Foliage quality may decline in deciduous trees following defoliation, thus affecting the insect generation responsible for the herbivory (rapid induced resistance, RIR), or future generations (delayed induced resistance, DIR). During outbreaks, trees often suffer partial or complete defoliation for two or more successive years, yet most studies have examined induced resistance following only one season of defoliation, which may not reveal its full impact on herbivores.
   In a field experiment, 40 trees from each of two clones of trembling aspen, Populus tremuloides, were severely defoliated for one, three, and four years in succession by experimentally manipulating densities of an outbreak folivore, the forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma disstria. Treatments Were applied such that the individual and combined effects of RIR and DIR on the fitness of, the forest tent caterpillar could be assessed independently. In field assays, defoliation treatments did not affect larval development time and only marginally affected survival. However, fecundity in both clones was significantly reduced by a single season of defoliation concurrent with the bioassay (effects of RIR), by three consecutive years of defoliation prior to the year of the bioassay (effects of DIR), and by four consecutive years of defoliation (combined effects of RIR and DIR). There were no differences among the three defoliation treatments, indicating that the effects of DIR and RIR combined were not greater than each acting alone. Reductions in fecundity were less than half those observed during natural outbreaks, suggesting that other factors also must contribute to declining fecundity during the collapse of outbreaks.
   Short-term laboratory bioassays indicated that-defoliation effects observed in long-term field assays were not due to changes in relative growth rate (RGR) of second instars or final-instar males, which were unaffected, possibly because of increased relative consumption rates (RCR). Defoliation treatments decreased RGR of final-instar females in laboratory bioassays, despite elevated RCR.
   Both defoliation treatment and aspen clone influenced parasitism by tachinid flies that detect hosts through volatiles released from leaves damaged by caterpillars. Parasitism was highest on trees defoliated concurrently with the larval bioassay. However, there were no differences between trees defoliated prior to the bioassay and control trees, indicating that effects on parasitism were not due to defoliation-induced changes in host quality per se. Thus, there were no additive interactions between DIR and parasitism that would amplify delayed density-dependent effects on population dynamics. Spatial responses of these tachinids to host density or to current defoliation rather than the defoliation history of the trees may enhance the stabilizing effect of RIR on population dynamics. Conversely, differences in parasitism among clones could contribute to spatial variation in tent caterpillar population density. Neither defoliation effect on host quality nor parasitism was sufficient to slow reproductive rates to levels observed in declining outbreaks in nature, suggesting that single-factor explanations for tent caterpillar population dynamics are unlikely.

AB Water-column methane oxidation can represent a substantial carbon transformation pathway in lakes, and circumstantial evidence indicates that methane may be a potentially important source of carbon for pelagic food webs. We estimated methanotrophic bacterial production (MBP), methanotrophic bacterial growth efficiency (MBGE), heterotrophic bacterial production (HBP), primary production (PP), and the relative contribution of methanotrophic bacteria to overall bacterial biomass in three very different lakes during summer and winter. In addition, we measured stable carbon isotope ratios in particulate organic matter (POM), surface sediments, zooplankton, and methane. MBP corresponded to 0.3-7% of the organic C production by primary producers, and 0.5-17% of HBP during summer. During winter, MBP was 3-120% of HBR MBP generally dominated the heterotrophic bacterial production at greater depths. Methanotrophic biomass was 3-11% of total bacterial biomass on a depth-integrated basis. Zooplankton were generally more depleted in C-13 than POM. If phytoplankton delta(13)C signatures were -35 to -30parts per thousand, such as the POM signals, observed zooplankton signatures could be explained by a fraction of 5-15% methanotrophic bacteria in their diet. The results indicate that methanotrophic bacteria can provide a significant food source for zooplankton, and that methane oxidation represents a potentially important benthic-pelagic carbon and energy link in many lakes, particularly during winter.

AB Planktonic larvae of marine organisms may vary greatly in individual condition. Larval quality, metamorphosis, juvenile growth, and mortality of the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides were monitored in the field and laboratory for 4 mo to determine whether propagule quality varied among daily cohorts and influenced juvenile performance. I measured the organic content of individual planktonic cyprids sampled on 15 days during the recruitment season. Settlers were monitored daily on natural substrata in the field and on settlement plates deployed daily and transferred to the laboratory. Cyprid organic content declined as the recruitment season progressed. Metamorphic success and growth differed among cohorts in both the field and laboratory. Mortality differed among cohorts in the field, but no mortality occurred in the laboratory. Metamorphic success and growth increased with increasing cyprid organic content in the laboratory. Growth in the laboratory was high for the first 7 of,10 daily cohorts monitored. In the field, the first and last three cohorts of the season grew poorly even though cyprid organic content was greater for the first three cohorts. These findings indicate that larval quality can vary among cohorts and impact juvenile performance. Studies of population and community structure may benefit from consideration, of propagule quality.

AB We take advantage of a fortuitous. local extinction and recolonization of white-lipped peccaries (WLPs) at the Cocha Cashu Biological Station in southeastern Peru to assess the impact of this high-biomass seed predator on the recruitment of a dominant member of the tree community, the palm Astrocaryum murumuru. WLPs were common at Cocha Cashu in the mid-1970s. In 1978, the species vanished from the entire region and did not reappear until 1990. To assess the impacts of the presence-absence of WLPs on Astrocaryum. recruitment, we conducted transect counts of both the number and spatial distribution of palm seedlings in 1978 (when WLPs were present), in 1990 (after a 12-yr absence of WLPs), and in 1999 (after 10 yr of recovery). Other factors affecting recruitment, such as climate variability, differences in tree fecundity, and fluctuations of vertebrate and invertebrate seed predators were also examined as alternative hypotheses for any changes in seedling spatial distribution and abundance.
   In the absence of WLPs, the density of Astrocaryum seedlings increased 1.7-fold, and the spatial distribution of seedlings with respect to safe sites was significantly altered. After the return of WLPs to the study area, seedling density dropped to its former level, and the spatial distribution of seedlings with respect to safe sites returned to the same pattern found 21, yr earlier in 1978. None of the other factors investigated varied systematically with the census intervals. These results demonstrate that the absence of a single, albeit important, member of a diverse seed predator guild can have a major impact on the demography of a common tree species. We infer that individual seed predators can play central roles in regulating the demography of tropical trees, as envisioned many years ago by Janzen and Connell, and that their extirpation or extinction can have cascading effects in tropical ecosystems.

AB Analyses of growth response to resource availability are the basis for interpreting whether trophic trade-offs contribute to diversity. If different species respond most to resources that are limiting at different times, then those differences may trade off with other trophic or life-history traits that, together, help to maintain diversity. The statistical models used to infer trophic differences do not accommodate uncertainty in resources and variability in how individuals use resources. We provide hierarchical models for resource-growth responses that accommodate stochasticity in parameters and in data, despite the fact that causes are typically unknown. A complex joint posterior distribution taken over > 10(2) parameters is readily integrated to provide a comprehensive accounting of uncertainty in the growth response, together with a small number of hyperparameters that summarize the population response. An application involving seedling growth response to light availability shows that large trophic differences among species suggested by traditional models can be an artifact of the assumption that all individuals respond identically. The hierarchical analysis indicates broad trophic overlap. with the implication that slow dynamics play a more important role in preserving diversity than is widely believed.

AB How great an effect does self-generated spatial structure have on logistic population growth? Results are described from an individual-based model (IBM) with spatially localized dispersal and competition, and from a deterministic approximation to the IBM describing the dynamics of the first and second spatial moments. The dynamical system incorporates a novel closure that gives a close approximation to the IBM in the presence of strong spatial structure. Population growth given by the spatial logistic model can differ greatly from that of the nonspatial logistic equation. Numerical simulations show that populations may grow more slowly or more rapidly than would be expected from the nonspatial model, and may reach their maximum rate of increase at densities other than half of the carrying capacity. Populations can achieve asymptotic densities substantially greater than or less than the carrying capacity of the nonspatial logistic model. and can even tend towards extinction. These properties of the spatial logistic model are caused by local dispersal and competition that affect spatial structure, which in turn affect, Population growth. Accounting for these local spatial processes brings the theory of single-species population growth a step closer to the growth of real spatially structured populations.

AB Investigations into vertebrate life histories have demonstrated trade-offs between growth and reproduction that can result in individual and population-specific variation in life-history Strategies. Mechanisms to explain variation among populations, however, often remain unidentified. We examined the relative strength of genetic (population source) and environmental (population social structure) factors on variation in growth and timing of maturation for juvenile male bluegill in a common garden experiment. We placed juvenile male bluegill collected from two different wild source populations, one with parental males that are large (>190 mm total length) and one with parental males that are stunted (<155 mm total length), in a common environment and varied the social structure by controlling the presence or absence of large, mature, male bluegill collected from a third population. Juvenile male bluegill from both populations allocated significantly more energy to reproduction in the absence of large males than in their presence. Within ponds, differences in growth and maturation rates between juvenile males from the two source populations were small but significant. These results indicate both genetic and environmental components to growth and maturation in bluegill but emphasize the importance of social interactions in shaping individual life-history strategies.

AB We determined the individual and population responses to food availability of wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus wintering in small forest woodlots by means of a food addition experiment. The allocation of the extra provided energy to the maintenance of body condition and reproduction was expected to vary between sexes due to their different energy investment in reproduction and to the different indirect costs of reproduction associated with different hormone-mediated susceptibilities to parasite infections.
   There were no effects of food supplementation on the density of adult males or on the overall density of mice. However, adult females were marginally more abundant and the sex ratio was more balanced in supplemented woodlots. Body condition (as estimated by body mass, body mass relative to body size, and amount of fat reserves), did not differ among treatments for either adult males or females. The prevalence and intensity of endoparasites of short life cycle (oxyurid nematodes) were lower in food-supplemented woodlots than in controls and lower in females than in males. No differences were found for endoparasites with long life cycles (telacid nematodes and cestodes). Males with intermediate parasite loads were in better body condition than either nonparasitized or highly parasitized individuals, and the body condition of each group of males was better in food-supplemented woodlots than in controls. This nonlinear relationship between parasite loads and body condition was apparently due to indirect costs of reproduction in control woodlots, where there was a direct relationship between male reproductive effort (relative testis size) and parasite loads. This relationship was not found in supplemented woodlots.
   Most individuals were breeding actively at the end of winter. Males had larger testicles, and females showed an advanced breeding, and probably enhanced survival and larger litter sizes, in supplemented woodlots. Individual mice wintering in Mediterranean fragmented forests are thus food limited, and directed most of the extra provided food resources to reproduction without losing body condition or antiparasite abilities. This enhanced reproduction, rather than improved body condition, may translate into larger population densities and recruitment.

AB Module dynamics were studied for the shade-tolerant canopy tree species Vouacapoua americana in a French Guiana rain forest. A module life cycle graph was constructed, including all the possible transitions between four module states: apically growing (G), apically dormant (D), apically arrested (A), and branching (J). Transitions (module level) were translated to the module population growth rate lambda (tree level) and related to the variance in lambda among 18 different trees. This variance was also related to light availability (1-60% of ambient PAR) and tree height (5-30 m).
   Three module life cycle pathways (or loops) were dominant in their contributions to lambda: persistent apical dormancy (D-->D), biannual apical growth (G-->D-->G), and biannual branching by dormant modules (J-->D-->J). This suggests that biannual or even slower module production rates predominate in the module life cycle. The positive covariance between biannual loops seems the result of synchronization in apical and axillary activity. Slow production rates and synchronization allow trees to accumulate carbon, flush massively, and escape from herbivore attacks, and at the same time allow the tree to replace its leaves.
   The variance in lambda (V(lambda)) among trees was low. Apical trade-offs, which occur as one apical fate excludes other apical fates by definition, lead to negative covariances between apical growth and apical dormancy, and thus reduced the net contributions of the apical transitions to the variance in lambda among trees. Branching (D-->J) was independent of such trade-offs, was highly variable, increased with light availability, and almost fully accounted for V(lambda). Module fates and V(lambda) were unaffected by tree height.
   The module mechanisms underlie the rather invariable module population growth rate lambda in the shade, as well as the increasing lambda during higher light episodes, enabling shade-tolerant canopy trees to grow up and survive in a heterogeneous forest light environment.

AB Recent research suggests that the behavior of individuals under risk of predation could be a key link between individual behavior and population and community dynamics. Yet existing theory remains largely untested at large spatial and temporal scales. We manipulated food available to age-0 rainbow trout while at risk of cannibalism, in a replicated factorial whole-take experiment, to test whether the trade-off between growth and mortality rates is mediated by foraging activity by young fish under predation risk. We found that this trade-off exists for young fish at the whole-system scale, and that food-dependent behavioral variation has large mortality consequences. In high-food lakes, age-0 trout spent less time moving, fewer individuals swam continuously, and those swimming continuously swam at slower speeds relative to those in low-food lakes. Age-0 trout also used deep, risky habitats less when food was abundant. This lower activity, combined with avoidance of risky habitats, coincided with 68% higher survival in high-food lakes. If general, this trade-off may be a key mechanism linking individual behavior to population-level processes in size-structured populations.

AB The concept of a zone of influence, the area over which a plant alters the environment, forms the basis of many models of plant competition. Because of logistical difficulties, we actually know little about the sizes and shapes of zones of influence belowground. Here we advocate obtaining data on plants' belowground zones of influence, including the length and distribution of lateral roots, in order to understand better how plants respond to their abiotic soil environment and to other plants. We provide several examples from recent work. First, we present an analysis of a large global data set which shows that maximum lateral root spread correlates with canopy size but that, for a given canopy size, maximum lateral root spread is greater in arid environments and in coarse textured soils. Second, we use an experiment with the weedy annual Abulilon theophrasti to show how using nutrient analogs as tracers yields information about lateral root distributions within populations. In our experimental populations, the belowground zone of influence extended well beyond the closest neighboring plants. Overlap in zones of influence increased in nutrient patches. Third, we propose a new conceptual model of belowground zones of influence based on these and other data sets. The model assumes that the probability of resource uptake or competing with a particular neighbor declines with distance from the stem but that considerable uptake at great distances from the stem is still possible. It also allows for plasticity in root distributions as might occur in spatially heterogeneous soils. Finally, we suggest how better information oil the shapes and sizes of below-round zones of influence will help develop a more predictive framework for understanding plant competition.

AB Several recent studies demonstrate that yield of individual plants, and their allocation of biomass between roots and shoots, can be profoundly affected by the pattern of supply of soil-based resources. Patchy provision of soil-based resources can affect the location of root biomass, as roots often proliferate in nutrient-rich patches. Root system size is important in determining whether plants access nutrient-rich patches, and the proportion of root systems located within such patches. This proportion will alter as growth proceeds. Species with small root systems have a limited ability to place roots in nutrient-rich patches even when they are very close. Of four species with different root system sizes, the growth of the species with the smallest root system was significantly limited by being located in nutrient-poor substrate even when nutrient-rich substrate was only 3.5 cm away, whereas three species with larger root systems were not disadvantaged. Both in the laboratory and in the field, root density is higher in nutrient-rich patches, and such patches can contain roots of many plants. Recent work showing that plants can respond to non-self roots sharing the same, nutrient supply suggests that competition will be more severe in nutritionally patchy substrates than in homogeneous environments with the same overall nutrient supply. Taken together, these facts lead to the prediction that inter- and intraspecific plant interactions will be influenced by patterns of nutrient supply. We present evidence supporting this prediction, and indicating that population and community structure are also affected by patterns of nutrient supply. Significant differences in population yield, plant size distribution, and mortality have been recorded between populations growing under patchy and uniform conditions. Plant communities grown from, identical seed inocula, with the same overall nutrient supply, provided in different spatial and temporal patterns, differed by up to 44% in total biomass, up to 70% in root biomass, and differed in species composition. These significant effects of heterogeneous resource supply on plants merit further detailed study.
   We present a framework of predictions of the impacts of different types of spatial heterogeneity in nutrient supply on the performance of single plants, and on plant interactions, plant populations, and plant communities.

AB Plant productivity and ecosystem productivity are strongly influenced by nutrient availability, Which is largely determined by the decomposition rate of plant litter. Belowground litter inputs (dead roots, mycorrhizae, and exudates) are larger than aboveground litterfall in many systems. Chemical quality and diameter primarily control decomposition for coarse roots, but these patterns do not hold for finer classes of roots, which are frequently colonized by mycorrhizae. Though mycorrhizal status is known to drastically alter toot chemistry, morphology, life span, and exudation, it has never been explicitly, considered as a factor affecting root decomposition. We hypothesize that mycorrhizal status substantially influences fine root decomposition rates.
   Both ectomycorrhizal (EM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can change root properties but do,so in different ways. Dominant tree species of most cold and temperate forests rely heavily on EM associations. EM fungi form massive structures that envelop fine roots. Roots infected by ectomycorrhizae have higher nitrogen concentrations than nonmycorrhizal roots, which would be expected to increase decomposition rates, but much of this nitrogen is bound in recalcitrant forms, such as chitin, so the net effect on decomposition is difficult to predict. AM fungi lack elaborate, macroscopic structures and may not alter root chemistry as profoundly.
   In addition to mycorrhizal roots, external fungal hyphae can contribute significantly to ecosystem carbon budgets and thereby influence rates of soil carbon turnover. Hyphae have commonly been considered a rapidly decomposing carbon pool, though this has never been demonstrated experimentally. If hyphae are produced at the expense of rapidly decomposing root exudates, then the net effect of hyphal litter production might be to reduce soil microbial activity and overall carbon cycling rates. Based on known differences in morphology and chemistry, EM hyphae may be more recalcitrant than AM hyphae. In summary, we submit that mycorrhizal status could substantially influence fine root decomposition and soil carbon processing rates, potentially explaining some of the variation observed within and among individual plant species and ecosystems.

AB Spatial heterogeneity in microenvironments may provide unique regeneration niches for trees and may promote forest diversity. We examined how heterogeneity in understory cover, mineral nutrients, and moisture and their interactions with canopy gaps contribute to the coexistence of three common, co-occuring tree species. We measured survival and height growth of 1080 seedlings of Acer rubrum (red maple), Liriodendron tulipifera (yellow poplar), and Quercus rubra (red oak) that were planted in one of five understory treatments: removal of understory vegetation, trenched, trenched plus removal of understory vegetation, fertilization, and a control. Understory treatments were replicated in 12 paired gap and canopy environments.
   Survivorship varied among species, with Q. rubra having the highest probability of surviving beyond the 1135-day experiment (probability = 0.64), followed by A. rubrum (probability = 0.27) and L. tulipifera (probability = 0.07). Although canopy gaps and understory treatments had large effects on survivorship, species survival rankings changed little across microenvironments; Q. rubra had the highest survival in all microenvironments. In contrast to survival, L. tulipifera had a relative growth rate for height that was three times greater than that of A. rubrum and Q. rubra in high-resource microenvironments. There was broad overlap among species in relative growth rates in the remaining seven microenvironments, with no clear top-ranked species.
   Differences in seedling growth and survival across these 10 microenvironments may contribute to the coexistence of two of the three species studied, L. tulipifera and Q. rubra, but not A. rubrum. Q. rubra had higher survival than A. rubrum and L. tulipifera in all microenvironments, but L. tulipifera tended to grow faster than A. rubrum and Q. rubra in high-resource microenvironments. Despite the generally poor performance of A. rubrum, it was the only surviving species in some quadrats at the end of the experiment, indicating that stochastic effects, in conjunction with broad niche overlap, may also contribute to species coexistence. The importance of stochastic effects will probably increase when differential fecundity across these three species is considered because the high fecundity of A. rubrum offsets survival and growth disadvantages of its seedlings through their greater total abundance.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are integral components of grasslands because most plants are associated with interconnected networks of AM hyphae. Mycorrhizae generally facilitate plant uptake of nutrients from the soil. However, mycorrhizal associations are known to vary in their mutualistic function, and there is currently no metric that links AM functioning with fungal colonization of roots. Mycorrhizal structures differ in their physiological and ecological functioning, so changes in AM allocation to intraradical (inside roots) and extraradical (in soil) structures may signal shifts in mycorrhizal function. We hypothesize that the functional equilibrium model applies to AM fungi and that fertilization should reduce allocation to arbuscules, coils, and extraradical hyphae, the fungal structures that are directly involved in nutrient acquisition and transfer to plants. This study compared AM responses to experimental N enrichment at five grasslands distributed across North America. Samples were collected from replicated N-enriched (and some P-enriched) and control plots throughout the growing season for three years. Intraradical AM structures were measured in over 1400 root samples, extraradical hyphal density was measured in over 590 soil samples, and spore biovolume was analyzed in over 400 soil samples. There were significant site X N interactions for spore biovolume, extraradical hyphae, intraradical hyphae, and vesicles. Nitrogen enrichment strongly decreased AM structures at Cedar Creek, the site with the lowest soil N:P, and it increased AM structures at Konza Prairie, the site with the highest soil N:P. As predicted by the functional equilibrium model, in soils with sufficient P, relative allocation to arbuscules, coils, and extraradical hyphae was generally reduced by N enrichment. Allocation to spores and hyphae was most sensitive to fertilization. At the mesic sites, this response was associated with a shift in the relative abundance of Gigasporaceae within AM fungal communities. This study demonstrates that N enrichment impacts mycorrhizal allocation across a wide range of grassland ecosystems. Such changes are important because they suggest an alteration in mycorrhizal functioning that, in turn, may impact plant community composition and ecosystem function.

AB Previous studies point to biogeographic (i.e., evolutionary and demographic) and ecological (i.e., habitat differentiation and disturbance) processes as the most important causes of spatial variation in species richness and species composition (occurrence and abundance). We examined patterns of variation in vascular plant and bryophyte species composition among 150 1-m(2) plots distributed semi-randomly over 11 Norwegian boreal swamp-forest localities. Swamp forests are species-rich islands in an otherwise species-poor forest landscape. For each plot, 53 environmental variables were recorded. By using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), we found that similar to20% of the explainable variation in species composition was due to swamp-forest affiliation, in addition to the similar to35% that was due to environmental differences between swamp-forest localities. The uniqueness of the species composition of each swamp forest was also emphasized by analyses of compositional dissimilarity. Plots were significantly more dissimilar if situated in different swamp forests than if situated in the same swamp forest, after environmental differences had been corrected for. The lack of any significant relationship between compositional dissimilarity and geographical distance or swamp-forest area indicated that this pattern was not mainly due to recent successful dispersal and establishment events. We argue that the distinctness of swamp forests, in particular, those richer in species and soil nutrients, is due to a combination of factors among which randomness in establishment in gaps ("windows of opportunity") and persistence of established clonal species are important. Furthermore, we argue that the probability for successful recruitment may have been higher in previous time periods than it is today. The unique combination of important determinants of the species composition in boreal swamp forests supports the view that there exists a diversity of explanations for diversity, and that these, to a large extent, are system and/or area specific.

AB The spatially explicit and mechanistic model TREEGRASS was used to test the effects of tree density, tree spatial distribution, and tree size distribution on radiation absorption, net primary production (NPP), and water fluxes for a West African savanna. The model has previously been shown to adequately predict radiation absorption, production, and soil water balance in humid savannas. Using field measurements quantifying the spatial variations in grass NPP the model was found to predict correctly the effect of tree abundance on grass NPR Model simulations showed that annual photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), absorption efficiency, NPP, and transpiration of the tree layer increased with increasing tree density and decreased with increasing tree aggregation; the grass layer showed the opposite trends. Total NPP (tree plus grass) remained stable for all tree densities and decreased slightly for aggregated tree distributions. Total transpiration, increased with tree density and was not affected by tree aggregation. Changing the tree size distribution had no effect on radiation absorption or on carbon and water fluxes.
   This study showed that fine-scale vegetation structure can influence NPP and water fluxes. As such, it should be taken into account when assessing the functioning of treegrass systems. However, the detailed fine-scale structure of the tree layer is rarely available for savanna ecosystems. Thus we assessed the reliability of two common descriptors of savanna vegetation, leaf area index (LAI) and tree canopy cover, to predict PAR absorption, NPP, and evapotranspiration. Neither of these descriptors could adequately predict all the simulated effects. However, tree canopy cover can be used to reasonably estimate radiation absorption and carbon fluxes, whereas LAI is a good predictor of water fluxes. Therefore, mapping and monitoring approaches incorporating both LAI and tree canopy cover appear to be suitable alternatives to quantifying the fine-scale vegetation spatial structure when assessing ecosystem function in savanna-like ecosystems.

AB Interstitial flow of river (hyporheic) water influences algal productivity, benthic assemblages, and locations of fish spawning. However, little is known of the effects of hyporheic flow on the growth of riparian vegetation. By increasing water availability and nutrient delivery, regional upwelling of hyporheic water may increase the growth of terrestrial vegetation. We tested and accepted the hypothesis that cottonwood trees (Populus trichocarpa) in a gaining reach of an alluvial floodplain grow faster than trees in a losing reach by comparing basal areas and ages on an expansive floodplain in western Montana (USA). Trees in the gaining reach had basal areas twice the size of the trees in the losing reach. after correcting for tree age. In addition, the carbon-to-nitrogen ratios in leaves were 16% lower in the gaining reach. Lower cottonwood stem densities, deeper layers of fine sediments, and a higher water table occurred in the gaining compared to the losing reach. Each of these variables was significantly correlated with tree growth and likely interacted to influence the productivity of cottonwoods. We concluded that hydration and fertilization of riparian trees likely is mediated by hyporheic flow.

AB Spatial structure in plant communities occurs in the forms of (1) single-species aggregation and dispersion patterns, (2) distance-dependent interactions between species, and (3) the response to the spatial structure of environmental conditions. Different methods deal with these components of spatial variation: geostatistical analysis reveals autocorrelation in a spatial sample; the variance of species richness has been used as an indicator for interspecific interactions due to niche limitation; and ordination techniques describe multispecies responses to environmental factors. Based on the mathematical properties of presence-absence data, it is shown how variogram modeling, the testing of interspecific associations, and multiscale ordination can be integrated using the same set of distance-dependent variance-covariance matrices (variogram matrix). The variogram matrix partitions the variance of community data into spatial components at the levels of the individual species, species composition, and species richness. It can be used to factor out the effects of single-species aggregation patterns, interspecific interactions, or environmental heterogeneity. The mathematical integration of traditionally unrelated methods increases the interpretability of variograms of plant communities, provides a spatial extension and an empirical null model for the variance test of species richness, and extends multiscale ordination to nonsystematic spatial samples. Beyond the individual applications, the variogram matrix provides a framework for a mathematical unification of geostatistics, multivariate data analysis, and the analysis of variance that may enable ecologists from a broad range of fields to incorporate spatial effects into their research and to integrate analyses across different levels of biological organization.

AB We studied the effects of soil fungi on interactions between Centaurea melitensis, an exotic invasive weed in central California, and two co-occurring grasses, Nassella pulchra and Avena barbata, The fungicide benomyl reduced the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in plant roots but did not affect non-AM fungi. Centaurea plants grown alone were >50% smaller with the resident microbial community intact than when benomyl was applied. When grown with Nassella, the effect of benomyl was reversed. Centaurea grew almost five times larger with the resident microbial community intact. Fungicide had no effect on the biomass of Centaurea grown with Avena, but biomass of Centaurea was significantly lower when grown with Avena than when grown with Nassella or alone. Photosynthetically fixed carbon may have been transferred from Nassella via soil fungi to Centaurea, constituting a form of soil fungi-mediated parasitism, but such a transfer did not occur from Avena to Centaurea. Second. Nassella may have been more inhibited by soil pathogens in the presence of Centaurea than when alone. and the inhibition of Nassella may have released Centaurea from competition. A third possibility is that Nassella has strong positive effects on the growth of Soil fungi. but the positive feedback of beneficial soil fungi to Nassella is less than the positive feedback to Centaurea. Regardless of the mechanism, the difference in soil fungicide treatment effects on competition between Centaurea and Nassella vs. Centaurea and Avena has important implications for the invasion of California grasslands.

AB Metapopulation models are important tools to predict whether a species can persist in a landscape consisting of habitat patches. Here a Bayesian method is presented for estimating parameters of such models from data on patch occupancy in one or more years. Earlier methods were either ad hoc, produced only point estimates, or could only use turnover information. The new method is based on the assumption of quasi-stationarity. which enables it to use not only turnover data, but also snapshot data. Being Bayesian, the method produces reliable information about the uncertainty of the parameters and model-based predictions in the form of posterior distributions. It is computationally demanding, but considerably faster than a recently developed Bayesian method extended beyond turnover data. The method is compared with existing methods (placed in a Bayesian framework) by fitting an extended incidence function model to a data set on a tree frog metapopulation with many missing values and by predicting its viability, mean occupancy, and turnover rate after 100 yr.

AB Grasslands are one of the major biomes on earth and can serve as important soil carbon sinks. Nutrient enrichment of these grasslands can have a significant impact on carbon losses through the decomposition process. We investigated the effects of long-term (12-yr) experimentally increased N and/or P supply on litter production and on the chemistry and decomposition of bulk litter from two grasslands differing in soil nutrient status.
   Potential aboveground litter production in the controls of a P-rich low-productivity riparian grassland was lower than that in a N-rich high-productivity peat grassland and increased with enhanced N supply. Nutrient treatments did not enhance litter production in the high-productivity peat grassland. The concentrations of phenolics in bulk litter from the peat grassland, dominated by sedges, were 2-3 times higher than those in the riparian grassland that was dominated by herbs and grasses. At both sites increased nutrient supply had no detectable effect on phenolics concentrations. All P-related litter chemistry parameters reflected the higher soil P status of the riparian grassland. P fertilization had a greater effect on litter chemistry in the P-deficient peat grassland than in the P-rich riparian grassland. At both sites, there was no change in overall litter chemistry in response to N fertilization, except for higher lignin concentrations in the peat grassland litter. Both short-term (8 wk) litter incubations in the laboratory and a 3-yr litter bag study in the field showed that riparian grassland litter decomposed faster than litter from the peat grassland. The long-term nutrient additions had no significant effects on the decomposition of the bulk litter of each grassland type. Regression analysis on the combined data of the two sites showed that phenolics, and to a lesser extent, P-related litter chemistry parameters, exerted a strong control on both litter respiration and litter mass loss.
   Our study shows that long-term experimental nutrient additions do not lead to increased decomposition rates in grasslands and that the initial plant community litter quality is the main determinant of carbon losses through the decomposition process. The results of this study suggest that nutrient enrichment will likely affect ecosystem carbon balance more by affecting litter production than by affecting litter decomposition rates.

AB Birds that breed in hot, arid environments experience unique physiological demands resulting from efforts to maintain positive water balance when ambient temperatures are high, but humidity and water availability are low. We provided water to Black-throated Sparrows (Amphispiza bilineata) on breeding territories in the Mojave Desert of southern California to examine the effects of water availability on reproduction in desert birds, independent of the increase in food availability commonly associated with increased precipitation in and ecosystems. In both years of the study (2000 and 2001), water-supplemented (treatment) pairs laid significantly larger clutches than did control pairs. In 2000, the drier of the two years, the mean-clutch size of treatment pairs was almost 0.5 egg larger, or about 16% larger, than control pairs. Overall, the mean egg volume per nest in treatment and control pairs was not significantly different, and the mean proportion of eggs hatched was not significantly different at alpha = 0.05, but was nearly so. Daily nest survival probabilities were not greater in treatment nests than in control nests in 2000 or in 2001. Treatment nests did not produce a greater mean number of young surviving to day 8 than did control nests, although the trend is of greater means in treatment nests. The results of our study indicate that for species like the Black-throated Sparrow that are abundant in deserts, are successful in breeding there, and can survive without drinking water, water availability in arid environments can nevertheless impose limitations on reproduction.

AB The Natural Enemies Hypothesis (i.e., introduced species experience release from their natural enemies) is a common explanation for why invasive species are. so successful. We tested this hypothesis for Ammophila arenaria (Poaceae: European beach-grass), an aggressive plant invading the coastal dunes of California, USA, by comparing the demographic effects of belowground pathogens on A. arenaria in its introduced range to those reported in its native range. European research on A. arenaria in its native range has established that soil-borne pathogens, primarily nematodes and fungi, reduce A. arenaria's growth. In a greenhouse experiment designed to parallel European studies, seeds and 2-wk-old seedlings were planted in sterilized and nonsterilized soil collected from the A. arenaria root zone in its introduced range of California. We assessed the effects of pathogens via soil sterilization on three early performance traits: seed germination, seedling survival, and plant growth. We found that seed germination was reduced by 12-16% in nonsterilized soil compared with sterilized soil; similarly, seedling survival was reduced by 7-13%. Both root and shoot biomass decreased in the nonsterilized soil treatments compared with sterilized soil, by as much as 81% after 6 wk of growth. A comparison of the introduced and native ranges failed to show a demographic release from natural enemies; biomass effects of pathogens after 6 and 12 wk of growth were nearly equal between studies in California and The Netherlands. Identification of pathogens and inoculation experiments with fungi from the nonsterilized soil revealed several common fungal pathogens, whereas virtually no pathogenic nematodes were found. Therefore, we found a partial escape from enemies (i.e., pathogenic nematodes were absent in the introduced range), although there was no demographic release. These findings suggest that to fully understand the success and impact of A. arenaria in North America, one must look beyond escape from natural enemies.

AB Interspecific interactions that produce nontransitive competitive networks have been proposed to promote diversity in a broad range of systems, including coral reefs. In this paper, we model the effect of size-dependent shifts in competitive ability on the coexistence of canopy-forming and understory coral species, and we predict how these shifts influence patterns of community structure along large-scale gradients in disturbance and recruitment limitation. We consider three models, representing a gradient from purely hierarchical competition in which the canopy-former is dominant, to competition involving standoffs and reversals between the understory species and juvenile canopy-formers. Analysis of these models leads to two key conclusions. First, as competition becomes less transitive, coexistence may be promoted or inhibited, depending upon the extent to which the canopy-former can sustain itself by clonal propagation. Specifically, when clonal growth alone is adequate to sustain the canopy-former, increasing nontransitivity promotes coexistence. When it is not, nontransitivity inhibits coexistence. Secondly, size-dependent nontransitivity dramatically changes how gradients in disturbance and recruitment affect species coexistence. In contrast to hierarchical interactions, standoffs and reversals do not show an "intermediate recruitment" phenomenon, in which coexistence is facilitated at intermediate levels of recruitment. Moreover, under hierarchical competition, the dominant always benefits mote than the subordinate as recruitment is increasingly facilitated. Under standoffs and reversals, however, increasing recruitment often favors the canopy-former at some levels of disturbance, but the understory species at other levels of disturbance. These results differ markedly from previous models of stage-dependent competition, suggesting that promotion of coexistence by ontogenetic shifts in competitive ability depends upon the mechanisms by which competition occurs in particular ecological contexts. The results also indicate that the effects of gradients in disturbance and recruitment on community structure depend fundamentally on how species compete for space.

AB Is regeneration of understory trees in closed-canopy forests following large-scale disturbances influenced by the recent history of small-scale disturbances? We examined recruitment (in-growth of advance recruits to 2-cm diameter at 1.5-m height at each biennial census), growth, and mortality of non-pioneer understory trees in local areas with different disturbance histories in a southeastern United States hardwood forest over 13 years following a moderate-intensity hurricane. Recruitment was negligible beneath closed canopy, but occurred in hurricane-generated gaps, as well as older and recently formed preexisting gaps already containing recruits of understory trees. Growth rates of recruits in all three types of gaps were generally highest after the hurricane, and declined to similarly low rates over time. High recruitment and low mortality resulted in high densities of Ostrya virginiana and Carpinus caroliniana. Growth rates of these usurper-type species, which exhibit low mortality and substantial responsiveness to increased light levels, were initially Greater in hurricane-generated gaps than in pre-hurricane gaps. Other understory species had lower growth rates and higher mortality in all three types of gaps. Differences in local history at the time of the hurricane produced variation in the dynamics of non-pioneer understory tree populations and favored usurper-type species that responded rapidly in both hurricane-generated gaps and in preexisting gaps that had not yet closed.

AB Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most commonly used tools in the analysis of ecological data. This method reduces the effective dimensionality of a multivariate data set by producing linear combinations of the original variables (i.e., components) that summarize the predominant patterns in the data. In order to provide meaningful interpretations for principal components, it is important to determine which variables are associated with particular components. Some data analysts incorrectly test the statistical significance of the correlation between original variables and multivariate scores using standard statistical tables. Others interpret eigenvector coefficients larger than an arbitrary absolute value (e.g., 0.50). Resampling, randomization techniques, and parallel analysis have been applied in a few cases. In this study, we compared the performance of a variety of approaches for assessing the significance of eigenvector coefficients in terms of type I error rates and power. Two novel approaches based on the broken-stick model were also evaluated. We used a variety of simulated scenarios to examine the influence of the number of real dimensions in the data; unique versus complex variables the magnitude of eigenvector coefficients; and the number of variables associated with a particular dimension. Our results revealed that bootstrap confidence intervals and a modified bootstrap confidence interval for the broken-stick model proved to be the most reliable techniques.

AB Studies of phenotypic plasticity frequently ask how organisms respond to a change in their environment, but most organisms do not experience single environmental changes. Therefore, we need to move to the next step and understand how organisms respond to combinations of environmental changes. Recent studies of predator-induced plasticity have addressed how prey respond to different combinations of predators. I briefly review 22 studies of combined predator effects on prey phenotypes and identify four factors that make it difficult to interpret the results of these studies: (1) uncontrolled prey consumption, (2) a low number of prey traits, (3) a low number of predator combinations, and (4) confounded predator composition and total predator density.
   I address these challenges in an experiment that examined how wood frog tadpoles (Rana sylvatica) altered 12 behavioral, morphological, and life historical traits in response to four different caged predators (Erythemis, Belostoma, Dytiscus, and Anax). The predators were present alone at low density, alone at high density (2X), or combined into six pairwise combinations. When each predator was alone (at either low or high density), tadpoles discriminated among different predators and produced predator-specific phenotypes. The doubling of predator density rarely induced more extreme prey phenotypes. When predators were combined, the tadpoles generally developed phenotypes that were similar to those induced by the more risky predator alone (90% of all traits examined, at either low or high density). These results suggest that tadpoles perceive the risk of combined predators as being similar to the risk of the most dangerous predator in the pair, and not as a summed or averaged predation risk. The actual risk from these predator combinations remains to be tested. This appears to be the first study to take a comprehensive approach that controls prey consumption, examines a large number of prey traits, uses a large number of predator combinations, and separates the effects of predator composition and predator density. There is a clear need for more such studies to determine whether these results can be generalized to other taxa.

AB Diel vertical migration (DVM) is a widespread phenomenon in aquatic organisms, yet the adaptive significance of this behavior is still unclear. In particular, diel vertical migration by juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) has received considerable attention. We studied how changes in the light environment affect juvenile sockeye DVM in Alaskan lakes through changes in foraging rates and predation risk. Using hydroacoustics to track temporal changes in fish distribution, we found clear patterns of DVM and a strong, significant correlation between the mean depth of the sockeye and the amount of light at the lake surface. However, we could not detect diel changes in the depth distribution of fish large enough to be sockeye predators. Given a lack of diel vertical migration in the zooplankton community, it appears that juvenile sockeye were not simply tracking their food supply. Calculations of the in situ light experienced by individual juvenile sockeye suggested that they migrate to maintain a constant light environment. This light environment allowed the sockeye to exploit an antipredation window whereby they could forage on zooplankton while reducing the odds of visual detection by their predators. Furthermore, this antipredation window was continuous in early summer, but was split into two discrete time periods during the crepuscular hours in late summer. These data support the hypothesis that changes in habitat use by juvenile sockeye salmon reflect a dynamic strategy to minimize the ratio of predation risk to foraging gain that changes dramatically over the course of diel cycles in pelagic ecosystems.

AB The Enemies Hypothesis predicts that alien plants have a competitive advantage over native plants because they are often introduced with few herbivores or diseases. To investigate this hypothesis, we transplanted seedlings of the invasive alien tree, Sapitan sebiferum (Chinese tallow tree) and an ecologically similar native tree, Celtis laevigata (hackberry), into mesic forest, floodplain forest, and coastal prairie sites in east Texas and manipulated foliar fungal diseases and insect herbivores with fungicidal and insecticidal sprays. As predicted by the Enemies Hypothesis, insect herbivores caused significantly greater damage to untreated Celtis seedlings than to untreated Sapium seedlings. However, contrary to predictions, suppression of insect herbivores caused significantly greater increases in survivorship and growth of Sapium seedlings compared to Celtis seedlings. Regressions suggested that Sapium seedlings compensate for damage in the first year but that this greatly increases the risk of mortality in subsequent years. Fungal diseases had no effects on seedling survival or growth. The Recruitment Limitation Hypothesis predicts that the local abundance of a species will depend more on local seed input than on competitive ability at that location. To investigate this hypothesis, we added seeds of Celtis and Sapitan on and off of artificial soil disturbances at all three sites. Adding seeds increased the density of Celtis seedlings and sometimes Sapitan seedlings, with soil disturbance only affecting density of Celtis. Together the results of these experiments suggest that the success of Sapium may depend on high rates of seed input into these ecosystems and high growth potential. as well as performance advantages of seedlings caused by low rates of herbivory.

AB The inclusion of flexible behavior in population models can be viewed as part of the development of a mechanistic population/community framework based on individual-level concepts. Based on short-term experiments and analyses of the dynamics of nonstructured models, trait-mediated indirect effects resulting from flexible behavior have been suggested to have major effects on population and community dynamics. We use physiologically structured population models (PSPMs) to account for and assess the importance of flexible behavior in population models where individuals differ substantially in size. We investigate a consumer-resource system in which a size-structured consumer feeds on two resources that are present in two habitats differing in predation risk (pelagic open water vs. littoral vegetation). We compare two flexible rules that individuals might use to trade off foraging gains and size-dependent mortality risks in the two habitats. One rule maximizes the ratio of growth over mortality, and the other optimizes the expected instantaneous biomass increase.
   As a result of strong population feedback, the dynamics and habitat use are qualitatively the same for both rules when open-water mortalities are low, and indeed differ little from a case in which individuals use the two habitats in a fixed proportion. At higher open-water mortalities, the consumers using the two flexible rules show high-amplitude population cycles, whereas consumers using a fixed rule cannot persist. Overall, our results suggest that the behavioral rule used by individuals may be of minor importance, whereas the population feedback is of major importance. In nonstructured models, increased persistence induced by flexible behavior co-occurs with destabilization, as we find here, but the mechanisms behind this pattern are different, driven by cohort cycles rather than by the paradox of enrichment. We argue that extrapolating from experimental data which describe short-term experiments may overemphasize or misrepresent the long-term, population-level effects of flexible behavior. The inclusion of behavior as a proper individual state in physiologically structured population models remains a fundamental issue to solve.

AB By acquiring symbiosis from the mycelium supported by neighboring plants, seedlings become connected to a common mycorrhizal network (CMN). Although the maintenance of a CMN may lead to mutual benefit among the neighboring plants, the benefits may be unequally distributed if the plants differ in their sink strength for the shared resources in the CMN. Hence, seedlings may not obtain any net benefit from a CMN maintained by competitively superior, mature plants. In a controlled greenhouse experiment, we showed that the presence of a mycorrhizal adult plant does not improve the growth of seedlings, although solitary seedlings benefit from mycorrhizae. Seedlings of the perennial, mycorrhizal, subarctic herbs Antennaria dioica, Campanula rotundifolia, Sibbaldia procumbens, and Solidago virgaurea were germinated alone or in the vicinity of an adult established Sibbaldia plant. The seedlings were either left nonmycorrhizal (NM) or were inoculated by spores or by a hyphal network connected to established Sibbaldia plants. Three arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were involved: Glomus claroideum, G. hoi, or an undescribed Glomus sp. isolate. In the absence of an adult Sibbaldia plant, the plant species responded differently to each AMF species, of which G. claroideum was most infective and most improved the growth of solitary seedlings. In NM seedlings grown alternatively with or without a NM adult plant, competition had no or only weakly adverse effects on seedling growth. Interestingly, the situation was the same in seedlings grown with a mycorrhizal adult plant: although heavily infected, seedlings did not show improved growth as compared to NM seedlings. A common mycorrhizal network may well imply some mutual aid for the connected plants, but competitive interactions within the CMN overwhelm any benefits.

AB We describe an approach for estimating occupancy rate or the proportion of area occupied when heterogeneity in detection probability exists as a result of variation in abundance of the organism under study. The key feature of such problems, which we exploit, is that variation in abundance induces variation in detection probability. Thus, heterogeneity in abundance can be modeled as heterogeneity in detection probability. Moreover, this linkage between heterogeneity in abundance and heterogeneity in detection probability allows one to exploit a heterogeneous detection probability model to estimate the underlying distribution of abundances. Therefore, our method allows estimation of abundance from repeated observations' of the presence or absence of animals without having to uniquely mark individuals in the population.

AB In central Europe, the hybridogenetic water frog Rana esculenta is a sexual parasite that only persists in the presence of the parental species, R. lessonae, with which it must mate in order to reproduce. R. esculenta is a superior larval competitor, and adult females are about three times more fecund than R. lessonae. This suggests that, in the absence of some balancing advantage to R. lessonae, R. esculenta should drive the parental species locally extinct, closely followed by itself. We measured annual survival rates over six years at two widely separated ponds using modern capture-mark-recaoture methods to test whether differences in adult survival might contribute to the persistence of the water frog system. We marked 856 adult frogs and recovered 182 at least once. The data did not deviate significantly from the assumptions of the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model at either pond. There were no detectable differences in recapture probabilities between taxa, but females were, overall, less likely to be recaptured. Survival was higher for R. esculenta in all but one year. Therefore, some mechanism other than adult survival must be invoked to explain the persistence of this unusual breeding system. There was considerable year-to-year variation in survival, ranging from 6% over the winter of 1996-1997, to 98% over the winter of 1995-1996. Although the two ponds are separated by 35 km, pond identity did not contribute to the minimum models. A composite measure of winter severity constructed from a principal components analysis of weather data during the course of the study had a very close relationship with survival (R. lessonae, r = 0.905; R. esculenta, r = 0.889). Survival was lowest in winters with low minimum temperatures coupled with high and variable. maximum temperatures.

AB Disturbances that are strongly linked to global climatic cycles may occur in a regular, predictable manner that affects composition and distribution of ecological communities. The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences worldwide precipitation patterns and has occur-red with regular periodicity over the last 130000 years. We hypothesized that ENSO, through effects on local weather conditions, has influenced frequency and extent of fires within Everglades National Park (Florida, USA). Using data from 1948 to 1999, we found that the La Nina phase of ENSO was associated with decreased dry-season rainfall, lowered surface water levels, increased lightning strikes, more fires, and larger areas burned. In contrast, the El Nino phase was associated with increased dry-season rainfall, raised surface water levels, decreased lightning strikes, fewer fires, and smaller areas burned. Shifts between ENSO phases every few years have likely influenced vegetation through periodic large-scale fires, resulting in a prevalence of fire-influenced communities in the Everglades landscape.

AB Invertebrate food webs in wetlands were traditionally thought to be fueled mainly by decaying macrophytes, but recently it has been recognized that microalgae may be more important. In particular, the paradigm that shredders of vascular plant litter dominate food web processes may not apply to many wetlands where shredders are rare and microalgae more abundant. This issue is complicated by potential consumption of floes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) released from living plants, and of exopolymer secretions (EPS) from both autotrophic and heterotrophic microbes. In Wyoming, we used gut contents and stable isotopes to investigate organic matter sources for the dominant invertebrates in oligosaline (0.5-5 g/L total dissolved solids) and mesosaline (5-18 g/L) wetlands. We examined the trophic importance of microalgae vs. macrophytes in wetlands with and without emergent vegetation (Scirpus acutus), with different growth forms and species of submersed plants (Chara spp. vs. Potamogeton pectinatus), with dominance by different microalgal types (phytoplankton, epiphyton, epipelon), and with different primary consumers (mainly amphipods vs. chironomid larvae). In all wetlands studied, guts of the major primary consumers contained little or no macrophyte tissue, but rather mostly amorphous detritus (organic particles with no recognizable cellular structure). Values of delta(13)C indicated that organic matter entering foodwebs was not from submersed macrophytes, but that emergent plants might be a source of DOM or EPS in amorphous detritus. However, in some wetlands, amphipods eating mainly amorphous detritus had the same delta(13)C values as chironomids eating a much higher fraction of diatoms, indicating that amorphous detritus was derived mainly from diatoms. Patterns of temporal change of delta(13)C in consumers, seston, and emergent plants supported this interpretation. We conclude that microalgae rather than macrophytes provided most organic matter for these food webs via amorphous detritus. Amorphous detritus is often thought to have poor nutrient quality and low assimilation efficiency, but this idea may not be true if amorphous detritus is largely floes of labile DOM/EPS. Our results suggest that characterizing the origin and nature of amorphous detritus is key to understanding variations in macroinvertebrate production among saline wetlands and. a broad range of wetland types.

AB Mathematical models have suggested that population cycles of northern voles are generated by a combined effect of delayed and direct density-dependent mechanisms. Predation is considered to be the most likely mechanism affecting vole populations in a delayed density-dependent manner. We conducted a replicated two-factor experiment with the field vole (Microtus agrestis) during 1999-2001 in western Finland, manipulating both predation rate and winter food supply to evaluate whether a shortage of winter food has the potential to limit the growth of vole populations in a direct density-dependent manner. Vole populations in fenced predator exclosures rapidly attained higher densities than in unfenced areas, with the difference persisting until the end of the experiment. In the first winter, food supplementation increased vole population growth in fenced areas, but not in unfenced areas. The growth of vole populations in both supplemented and nonsupplemented fenced areas became limited in a direct density-dependent manner during the first winter. During the second winter, food supplementation prevented the crash of vole populations within fences, whereas again no obvious effect was found in the areas exposed to predation. Furthermore, supplemental winter food increased the overwinter survival of voles in fenced areas in both winters. Our results indicate that Microtus vole populations that have succeeded in escaping regulation by predators are limited in growth by a lack of winter food. This factor is thus a strong candidate for the direct density dependence inherently necessary for the occurrence of population cycles.

AB Demographically open communities are often viewed as stochastically structured assemblages because most colonizing juveniles arrive via unpredictable dispersal mechanisms. However, interactions between established residents and incoming juveniles may affect juvenile persistence in species-specific ways and could therefore impose a degree of determinism on future Community structure.
   Using 16 spatially isolated communities of, coral reef fishes, I conducted two experiments to determine how prior residency by two guilds of fishes affected juvenile recruitment. Each experiment factorially manipulated the presence and absence of two guilds: resident piscivores (groupers and moray eels) and interference competitors (territorial damselfishes).
   In the first experiment, guilds were manipulated via selective removals, and subsequent recruitment (larval settlement minus mortality) was monitored for 44 days. In the second experiment, guilds Were placed within large cages to prevent direct resident-juvenile interactions, while allowing for any cues produced by enclosed fishes, thereby testing whether incoming larvae used resident-derived cues to select or reject settlement sites. Colonizing juveniles were collected from each reef over 42 days to prevent confounding resident- and recruit-derived cues. In the first experiment, piscivores inhibited recruitment of a damselfish (Pomacentridae) and a surgeonfish (Acanthuridae), and enhanced recruitment of a wrasse (Labridae). In contrast, territorial damselfishes inhibited recruitment of the damselfish and the wrasse, and enhanced recruitment of the surgeonfish. Observations of early recruitment patterns suggested that recruitment differences were established rapidly during the night or dawn periods shortly after settlement and before each daily census. In the second experiment, there was no evidence that larvae used resident-derived cues to select settlement sites, suggesting that recruitment differences in the first experiment resulted from differential mortality caused by direct resident-recruit interactions rather than differential larval settlement.
   These results demonstrate that interactions between established residents and newly arrived juveniles can have a strong influence on juvenile persistence, and that such interactions appear to be strongest within hours of larval, settlement. Furthermore, because resident effects were species specific, the present composition of these communities may impose a previously undocumented degree of determinism on their future structure.

AB Tree architecture determines a tree's light capture, stability, and efficiency of crown growth. The hypothesis that light demand and adult stature of tree species within a community, independently of each other, determine species' architectural traits was tested by comparing 53 Liberian rain forest tree species. We evaluated-whether species differed in their tree height, crown depth, and crown diameter, when compared at a standardized size of 15-cm diameter at breast height, and how their architecture changed early during ontogeny.
   Tree height was positively correlated with adult stature and light demand. By producing a relatively slender stem, large-stature species are able to rapidly reach their reproductive size, at a low cost for construction and support. Light-demanding species need a slender stem to be able to attain or maintain a position in the canopy. Both crown depth and crown diameter were negatively correlated with adult stature, but not with light demand. This is in contrast with the hypothesis that shade-tolerant species should have a shallow crown to reduce self-shading in a light-limited environment. Investing energy in height growth rather than lateral crown growth allows a rapid vertical stem extension, but crown diameter has to be sufficiently small to reduce the risk of mechanical failure. All architectural patterns were maintained during ontogeny. The key factors driving interspecific differences in tree architecture are the costs of height extension and mechanical stability. In general, light demand and adult stature represent independent axes of architectural differentiation, affecting tree architecture in different ways.

AB Genotypes of the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata from different geographic regions in North America vary considerably in the level of constitutive and inducible trypsin protease inhibitors (TrypPIs), a potent direct defense. as well as in the production of herbivore-induced volatiles that function as indirect defense. Genotypes collected from Arizona were found to lack the ability to produce TrpPIs at a transcriptional level. had decreased volatile production. but exhibited nicotine and growth responses that were not distinguishable from genotypes collected in Utah. In field trials with naturally occurring herbivores and in lab experiments with Manduca sexta larvae. Arizona genotypes were damaged more and sustained greater herbivore growth than the Utah genotypes. When Arizona and Utah genotypes were grown in competition, Arizona genotypes produced significantly more seed capsules than the Utah neighbor did. Moreover, jasmonate elicitation, which dramatically increased TrypPI production in only the Utah genotypes, reduced lifetime fitness measures of the Utah genotypes more than of the Arizona genotypes, demonstrating that TrypPI production is correlated with a fitness cost. The loss of both a direct and an indirect defense suggests a functional linkage between these types of defense.

AB The relative performance of a parasitic plant on different host species will depend on both direct and indirect effects of hosts on parasite interactions with mutualists and antagonists. Host species could affect parasite interactions with both herbivores and pollinators due to the uptake of defensive compounds and nutrients. However, the effects of different host species on parasitic plants have not been experimentally tested in the field. I determined the effect of two native host species, an alkaloid-producing, nitrogen-fixing lupine and non-alkaloid, non-nitrogen-fixing grass, on herbivory, pollination, and reproduction of the hemiparasitic plant Indian paintbrush (Castilleja indivisa). Within this experiment, I manipulated herbivory and pollination to determine their effects on Indian paintbrush reproduction. Indian paintbrush parasitizing lupines produced three times as many seeds and were more attractive to pollinators than Indian paintbrush parasitizing grass. However, there was no effect of host species on early season or floral herbivory. In addition, MANOVA revealed that host species influenced the response of Indian paintbrush female reproduction to experimentally manipulated herbivory and pollination treatments. Thus, the effect of hosts on parasites is mediated by interactions with herbivores and pollinators, and both direct and indirect effects may shape the selective pressures mediating interactions between hosts and parasites.

AB Alternative equilibria dominated by either submerged plants or phytoplankton have been described for communities in shallow lakes. A nutrient-mediated increase in periphyton (algae attached to plant surfaces) is often described as being responsible for the loss of plants from shallow lakes, yet this violates the stochastic assumptions of alternative equilibria. To determine if periphyton is capable of forcing a switch between these communities, the factors governing the success of aquatic plants were surveyed in 17 plant-dominated shallow lakes in Norfolk (United Kingdom) that varied in nutrient concentration and fish biomass. In these lakes, plant biomass was negatively related to the density of periphyton. However, the density of periphyton on the plants was correlated with the density of grazing invertebrates, not nutrient concentration. In turn, the biomass of fish determined the density of invertebrates. This cascade from fish to periphyton via invertebrates appeared to be evident even though plant-dominated lakes are heterogeneous and complex. Under conditions of plant dominance, periphyton appeared to have a stronger influence on plant growth than phytoplankton. Our data support a model where, within the range of nutrients where alternative equilibria are possible, fish are the prime determinants of community structure in shallow lakes, through a cascading effect of predation on grazing invertebrates influencing the biomass of periphyton and hence, plants. We suggest that the stochasticity required for alternative equilibria in shallow lake communities is often derived from the vagaries of fish colonization and reproduction.

AB The development of fruits after pollination places resource demands on plants that may influence the production of subsequent flowers. Pre-dispersal seed-predation, resulting in the destruction of developing seeds, may allow resource reallocation to the production of subsequent flowers. Silene latifolia, the white campion, is subject to predispersal seed predation by noctuid moths. In order to determine the potential for resource reallocation in S: latifolia we conducted a greenhouse experiment in which female plants were subjected to three levels of pollination (0%, 50%, or 100%) and simulated pre-dispersal seed predation (0%, 50%, or 100% of total fruit production). We assigned 10 plants to each of the seven treatments (0% pollinated had no fruit); in total, 1490 flowers were measured for flower size and scored for date of flowering and longevity. Flower size decreased over the course of the experiment. Average daily production was 12.2 flowers per plant on nonpollinated plants, but only 4.3 flowers on 100% pollinated plants. Chi-square results showed that simulated seed predation resulted in additional flowering bouts later in the course of the experiment. Time series analysis showed that the time between flowering bouts was Also influenced by predation. Plants with 0% predation had an average lag time of 29.5 days, whereas plants with 100% simulated seed predation had a lag period of 20.1 days. Flower longevity of non-pollinated flowers increased in plants that had flowers' pollinated but experienced no seed predation. Simulated predation resulted in a decrease in floral longevity. These results suggest that plants reallocate resources to the production of new flowers, after the destruction of fruits; thus, flowering phenology is influenced by pollination and seed predation. The relationship between pollinators and flowering phenology is well accepted; these. results indicate that seed predators play an equally important role in determining flowering phenology.

AB The distribution and abundance of organisms are affected by behaviors, such as habitat selection, foraging, and reproduction. These behaviors are driven by interactions within and between species, environmental conditions, and the biology of the species involved. Although extensive theoretical work has explored predator-prey dynamics, these models have not considered the impact of behavioral plasticity and life-history trade-offs on predicted patterns. We apply a modeling method that allows the consideration of a spatial, dynamic ecological game between predators and prey using a life-history perspective. As an illustrative example, we model the habitat selection of Antarctic krill- and penguins during the time when penguins are land-based for reproduction. Although environmental conditions and the life-history constraints of each species have both direct and indirect effects on both species, the penguin's foraging rule (whether food-maximizing or time-minimizing) has the greatest effect on the qualitative distribution pattern of both species. Size-dependent-diel vertical migration of krill also strongly affects penguin foraging patterns. This model generates suggestions for future research and qualitative predictions that can be tested in the field. The application of this method to a specific problem also demonstrates its ability to increase our understanding of important ecological interactions in general.

We describe a test for the presence of multiple, potentially stable equilibria in a single population. The test is based on the idea of critical smoothing. Critical smoothing was originally proposed for testing for multiple modes in a probability density function. The test is illustrated using data for the spruce budworm and the snowshoe hare.

AB What determines the way in which roots provide carbon to and interact with other components of the soil? Roots lose metabolites and signal molecules to the soil at rates of significance to soil organisms, and we need to know if the mechanisms of passive diffusion identified in hydroponics apply in soil, and whether other, active mechanisms complement them. New insights from biosensors into the heterogeneity and localization of exudation are transforming our understanding of root-microorganism relations. We need to know more about compounds that are exuded at subnutritional rates in soil and may act as signal molecules modifying the biology of soil organisms. Insights into one suite of such compounds is coming from studies of border cells. These cells are lost from the root cap at a rate regulated by the root and secrete compounds that alter the environment of and gene expression in soil microorganisms and fauna. The amount of root places an upper limit on the effect roots can have; carbon flow to the rhizosphere is a function of root growth. Top-down metabolic control analysis shows that the control over the rate at which roots grow is shared between root and shoot, with most control being in the shoot.

AB Experiments in ecology can have unintended side effects. Recently, it has been suggested that the act of visiting a plant, inherent to,studying herbivory, may alter plant performance and interactions. To evaluate the generality of this inference, we examined plant performance and herbivory on 14 plant species in three geographic regions. Visitation did not, significantly affect any of the variables that we measured, including leaf damage, height, biomass, or survivorship, for any species. However, rates of herbivory varied significantly among sites, and regions. Thus, our data do not support the generality of visitation impacting estimates of herbivory. We propose that future studies of. herbivory will gain more by evaluating spatial heterogeneity in interaction outcomes than by quantifying possible experimenter-caused variation.

AB Dispersal can strongly influence local population dynamics and may be critical to species persistence in fragmented landscapes. Theory predicts that dispersal by resident stream organisms is necessary to offset the loss of individuals to downstream drift. However, there is a lack of empirical data linking dispersal and drift to local population dynamics in streams, leading to uncertainty regarding the general demographic significance of these processes and the power of drift to explain observed dispersal patterns. I assessed the contribution of dispersal along a first-order stream to population dynamics of the headwater salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus (Plethodontidae). I conducted mark-recapture surveys of two contiguous 500 in long sections of a study stream in June, July, and August of 1999, 2000, and 2001. Movement by G. porphyriticus larvae and adults showed a strong upstream bias in the study stream, as well as in 11 other streams that I surveyed. Using mark-recapture models and Akaike's information criterion for model selection, monthly probability of dispersal from the downstream section to the upstream section of the study stream (mean +/- I SE) was estimated to be 0.02 +/- 0.01. The probability of dispersal from the upstream section to the downstream section was 0.00 +/- 0.00. Monthly survival probabilities did not differ between sections. Estimated monthly population growth rates were 1.01 +/- 0.01 in both sections. Net dispersal from the downstream section to the upstream section contributed to the equality of population growth rates. Additionally, reproduction and individual condition were lower in the upstream section, suggesting that population stability and growth there (i.e., lambda greater than or equal to 1.0) may have been dependent on immigration from downstream. Similar interactions between dispersal and variation in local demographic rates along the stream continuum may underlie the distribution and abundance patterns of other organisms at multiple spatial scales. Greater empirical understanding of these interactions will improve conservation of stream biota. The strong upstream bias of G. porphyriticus movement suggests that dispersal is not a response to downstream drift. I propose an alternative model for the evolution of directionally biased dispersal based on the landscape-scale distribution of headwater habitats.

AB Long-distance dispersal (LDD)-dispersal beyond the bounds of the local patch or cluster of conspecifics-will be most advantageous in landscapes in which large areas of suitable habitat are consistently available at long distances from established populations. We review conditions under which LDD will be selected and conclude that biotic interactions, and in particular specialized natural enemies, are likely to be one of the most important factors selecting for LDD in many species. We use simple spatially implicit and spatially explicit models to illustrate how such pests affect the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for investment in LDD. Patches currently occupied by parents are more likely to be infected than distant, potentially unoccupied,. patches, thus advantaging dispersal. Patchy infestations also result in higher variance in reproductive success among patches, which alone selects for increased among-patch dispersal. Both of these effects increase with the strength of the impact of infestation, and with the number of species competing for space in the community. We discuss the potential of different types of models and analytical tools to capture the impacts of pests on the evolution of LDD, and conclude that even simple models can illustrate the general relationship between pest pressure and LDD advantage, but only spatially explicit simulation models can fully elucidate the resulting ecological and evolutionary dynamics. In conclusion, we consider the potential role of selection for LDD in the spread of invasive species, and in long-term responses to habitat fragmentation and range shifts.

AB While numerous studies have been conducted on the ecology and evolution of phenotypic plasticity, to really understand plasticity we need to expose organisms to different environments over several ontogenetic stages. In this way, we can examine whether organisms change their phenotypic strategy over ontogeny, whether there are developmental windows that constrain the development of plastic traits, and whether behavior is more reversible than morphology if the environment reverts back to its original state. I addressed these questions by examining predator-induced plasticity in gray treefrog tadpoles (Hyla versicolor). Using aquatic mesocosms, I reared tadpoles with a constant absence of predators, a constant presence of predators, and the addition or removal of predators at three different times during their larval period. Tadpoles changed their phenotypic strategy over ontogeny; early in ontogeny they responded to predators by hiding, reducing their activity, and developing relatively deep tail fins. Later in ontogeny the tadpoles no longer employed behavioral defenses, but relied on a combination of greater mass, deeper tails, and shorter bodies. The phenotypic changes were inducible throughout most of ontogeny, suggesting, that there were few developmental windows. Activity, tail depth, and body depth were highly reversible, early in ontogeny but less reversible later in ontogeny; because hiding was only used early in ontogeny, I could not assess its reversibility. This reversibility should affect not only the induced species, but will likely transmit,the effects throughout the larger ecological community.

AB The latitudinal diversity gradient is the largest scale, and longest known, pattern in ecology. We examined the applicability of three versions of the energy hypothesis, the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis, and historical contingency to the gradient of terrestrial birds. The productivity version of the energy hypothesis, tested using actual evapotranspiration, a water-energy variable closely associated with plant productivity, accounted for 72% of the variance in a model of global extent. An historical contingency model based on biogeographic region explained 58% of the variance. A combined climate-region model accounted for 78% of the variance, but 52% comprised the overlap between these effects. This suggests that further resolution of contemporary vs. historical processes at the global level will require the inclusion of phylogenetic information.
   Regional-extent regression models suggest a latitudinal shift in constraints on diversity; measures of ambient energy (potential evapotranspiration and mean annual temperature) best predicted the diversity gradient at high latitudes, whereas water-related variables (actual evapotranspiration and annual rainfall) best predicted richness in low-latitude, high-energy regions. Intraregional spatial autocorrelation analysis confirmed that climatic models adequately describe geographic richness patterns at all but the smallest spatial scales resolved by the analysis. We conclude that the "water-energy dynamics" hypothesis, originally developed for plant diversity gradients, offers a parsimonious explanation for bird diversity patterns as well, presumably operating via plant productivity. However, more refined tests of historical factors are needed to fully resolve their influences on the gradient.

AB We tested for life history trade-offs among dormancy, sprouting, and flowering in a seven-year study of a threatened, perennial plant, the small yellow lady's slipper orchid (Cypripedium calceolus ssp. parviflorum (Salisb.) Fernald). The aboveground states of 629 genets were monitored over seven years in a wet meadow in northeastern Illinois, USA. With mark-recapture statistics, survival, resighting, and stage transitions were calculated among three stage classes of individuals: dormant, vegetative, and flowering. The best-fit and most parsimonious models suggested that (1) survival was constant among years, but varied by stage; (2) dormant individuals suffered significantly higher mortality and were more likely to become dormant in future years than sprouting or flowering individuals;, (3) flowering individuals had significantly higher survival and were more likely to flower in the future than sprouting and dormant individuals; and (4) sprouting individuals had a significantly higher stage transition to dormancy from the vegetative state than to any other state. Thus, our results identified costs of dormancy and sprouting to survival and future reproduction, but no costs of reproduction either to survival or future flowering effort. Dormancy seems unlikely to be adaptive except perhaps as a bet-hedging strategy under catastrophic conditions. Applying mark-recapture models to test predictions from life history theory provided a robust means to explore hypothetical trade-offs that may not have been observed in a conventional analysis and allowed dormancy to be estimated robustly without biasing survival estimation.

AB Most freshwater food web models assume that fish occupy the top trophic level. Yet many diet studies and a few caging and artificial stream experiments suggest that birds may be top predators in many freshwater systems. We conducted a large-scale field experiment to test whether avian predators affect the size distribution and abundance of fish in two midwestern streams. We used a combination of netting and perches to manipulate predation by Great Blue Herons (Ardea herodias) and Belted Kingfishers (Ceryle alcyon), and measured the response in the fish assemblage. Bird exclusions caused significant increases in medium size classes of two common prey, striped shiners (Luxilus chrysocephalus) and central stonerollers (Campostoma anomalum). We show that these species of piscivorous birds can alter the abundance of common prey and thus need to be considered more fully when attempting to explain the structure of aquatic food webs.

AB We extend the resource concentration hypothesis (herbivorous insects are more likely to find and stay in more dense and less diverse patches of their host plants) to plant communities. Specifically, whenever superior plant competitors spread to form dense stands, they will be found and attacked by their specialist insect enemies. This will decrease host plant abundance, causing a reduction in standing crop biomass, which will indirectly increase subordinate competitors and plant species richness. In this study, we found that a native, specialist chrysomelid beetle (Trirhabda virgata) in an old-field community decreased total standing crop biomass, leading to an increase in plant species richness. This reduction in biomass was due solely to a reduction in the biomass of the beetle's host plant, meadow goldenrod (Solidago altissima), which was the dominant plant species in this community. Our results demonstrate that when a superior competitor increases in density, the per-stem impact of herbivores increases due to a buildup of these herbivores in high-density host patches. Specifically, we found that as goldenrod density increased, the per-stem abundance of Trirhabda virgata also increased. In turn, species richness increased as the negative effect of insects on goldenrod biomass increased.
   Recent research suggests that litter accumulation could negate or cancel the effect of herbivorous insects on plant communities because litter accumulation increases with standing crop biomass, causing a decline in species richness. The litter accumulation hypothesis states that, in productive communities, the increase in the abundance of the superior competitor will lead to a dense accumulation of plant litter, causing a decline in species richness. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that as the biomass of the dominant plant species increased, litter mass also increased. In turn, species richness decreased as the negative effects of litter on stem density increased. Interestingly, the effect of litter on stem density depended on whether insects were present. Our results suggest the potential for a general rule: specialist insect herbivores will function as classic keystone species in plant communities whenever host species form large, dense aggregations if host plants are dominant species.

In a subalpine forest landscape in northwestern Colorado, we quantified spatial associations of fire and spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) outbreaks over. more than a century and developed a multivariate logistic model of probability of occurrence of spruce beetle outbreaks. The study area, an similar to2800 km(2) landscape in White River National Forest, was affected by severe widespread fires around 1879 and by a spruce beetle outbreak in the 1940s, wh1ch affected most of the forests that were dominated by Picea engelmannii (Engelmann spruce) and Abies lasiocarpa (subalpine fir). The boundaries of the fires ca. 1879 and of the 1940s spruce beetle outbreaks were digitized based on an 1898 vegetation map and modern aerial photograph interpretation, and overlaid in a Geographic Information System. The areas disturbed by the ca. 1879 fires and the 1940s beetle, outbreak were also overlaid with 303 fires recorded after 1950 as well as with topographic and forest structural variables.
   Forests that had burned in 1879 were less affected by the 1940s outbreak than older stands. On the other hand, areas affected by the 1940s spruce beetle outbreak showed no higher susceptibility to subsequent fires. A multivariate logistic model indicated that, although fire history had the greatest effect on stand susceptibility to spruce beetle outbreak, dominance of neighboring stands by spruce as well as elevation were also important predictors of outbreaks. Predictive modeling of spatial interactions between fire and spruce beetle disturbances needs to consider the high degree of variability in the nature of these interactions related to contingencies such as time since last major disturbance, topographic position, and weather during windows of potential interaction.

AB Populations are characterized by variability among individuals, a result of both intrinsic differences among individuals and environmental effects on individual performance. Despite the ubiquity of individual variation, its implications for population model choice are,not fully understood. Population models that use state variables representing individual features such as age or size assume that these state variables can predict the population trajectory. However, State variables are often chosen based on convenience or necessity; only rarely are they tested for importance and accuracy when individuals vary. We examined whether matrix projection models, a common choice in population modeling, provide accurate predictions when individuals vary in a population. With both density-dependent and density-independent formulations, we tested whether matrix projection models that used size as a state variable captured the dynamics of populations projected with an individual-based simulation (or i-state configuration model). We varied the initial size distribution of individuals, the degree to which. individual growth was size dependent, the tendency for positive correlations in growth through time, and the amount of stochasticity in growth, and we, asked what conditions affect the accuracy of matrix models. Stochasticity alone did not compromise the predictions of matrix models; rather, only populations with individual variation generated by strong size-dependent growth and growth correlations were poorly described by matrix models. Otherwise, matrix models captured the trajectories of populations with a fair degree of accuracy. Overall, our results provide guidance as to when and how individual variation must be included in population projections, and when a simple matrix model framework is inadequate.

AB The positive relationship between offspring size and offspring fitness is a fundamental assumption of life-history theory, but it has received relatively little attention in the marine environment. This is surprising given that substantial intraspecific variation in offspring size is common in marine organisms and there are clear links between larval experience and adult performance. The metamorphosis of most marine invertebrates does not represent a "newbeginning," and larval experiences can have effects that carry over to juvenile survival and growth. We show that larval size can have equally important carryover effects in a colonial marine invertebrate. In the bryozoan Bugula neritina, the size of the non-feeding larvae has a prolonged effect on colony performance after metamorphosis. Colonies that came from larger larvae survived better, grew faster, and reproduced sooner or produced more embryos than colonies that came from smaller larvae. These effects crossed generations, with colonies from larger larvae themselves producing larger larvae. These effects were found in two populations (in Australia and in the United States) in contrasting habitats.

AB Seed ecologists have often stated that they expect larger-seeded species to have lower survivorship through postdispersal seed predation than smaller-seeded species. Similar predictions can be made for the relationship between survivorship through predispersal seed predation and seed mass. In order to test these predictions, we gathered data regarding survivorship through 24 hours of exposure to postdispersal seed predators for 81 Australian species, and survivorship through. predispersal seed predation for 170 Australian species. These species came from an and environment, a subalpine environment, and a temperate coastal environment. We also gathered data from the published literature (global) on survivorship through postdispersal seed predation for 280 species and survivorship through predispersal seed predation for 174 species.
   We found a weak positive correlation between seed mass and the percentage of seeds remaining after 24 hours of exposure to postdispersal seed predators at two of three field sites in Australia, and no significant relationship across 280 species from the global literature, or at the remaining field site. There was no significant relationship between seed mass and survivorship through predispersal seed predation either cross-species or across phylogenetic divergences in any of the vegetation types, or in the compilation of data from the literature. Postdispersal seed removal was responsible for a greater percentage of seed loss in our field studies than was predispersal seed predation. On average, 83% of diaspores remained after 24 hours of exposure to postdispersal seed removers, whereas 87% of seeds survived all predispersal seed predation that occurred between seed formation and seed maturity. Mean seed survival was higher in the field studies than in the literature compilations, and species showing 100% survival were heavily underrepresented in the literature. These differences may be due to biases in species selection or publication bias. Seed defensive tissue mass increased isometrically with seed mass, but there was no significant relationship between the amount of defensive tissue per gram of seed reserve mass and survivorship through postdispersal seed predation.

AB Efforts to understand the population dynamics of marine species with planktonic larvae have been stymied by the fact that the larvae recruiting to a location have little chance of originating from that site. Patterns of,larval movement and the spatial scale of dispersal are expected to be major forces regulating the dynamics of marine populations and communities. Unfortunately, the scale and predictability of larval dispersal and its regulation by physical circulation remains unknown due largely to the impossibility of measuring dispersal in open marine environments. Here we exploit strong genetic differentiation among marine mussel populations in southwest England to measure larval dispersal among adjoining genetic patches. This approach allows estimates of larval dispersal over relatively great distances. We combine these measurements with results from a high-resolution model of coastal circulation to test the hypothesis that larval dispersal is regulated by physical circulation. We show that larval dispersal typically occurs over distances of similar to30 km but in some cases was at least 64 km. The circulation model accurately predicted general patterns of larval transport between genetic regions, the scale of larval dispersal, and genetic isolation created by physical barriers to circulation. We demonstrate that physical circulation models and genetic measures of larval transport can be coupled to assess the geographic scale of larval dispersal in marine environments.

AB Analysis of synchrony in population fluctuations can help to identify factors that regulate populations and the scales at which these factors exert their influence. Using 15 years of data on the abundances of songbirds at four replicate forest sites in New Hampshire, USA, we addressed two main questions: (1) Are forest bird populations synchronous at the scale measured (tens of kilometers), and if so, (2) what environmental factors are responsible for the synchrony? Nine of the 10 bird species we examined exhibited significant spatial synchrony across the four sites. Within nesting and foraging species groups, tree nesters and foliage gleaners exhibited the highest spatial synchrony. Long-distance (Neotropical) migrants exhibited higher spatial synchrony than did short-distance migrants or year-round residents. Synchrony within and among six species of long-distance, migratory, insectivorous birds was correlated with synchronous fluctuations in the abundance of lepidopteran larvae, a primary food type during the breeding season, which in turn have been shown to be influenced by El Nino/La Nina global climate patterns. Abundances of year-round resident species were related to another large-scale climatic phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation. Winter weather can have both direct (e.g., via temperature-mediated mortality) and indirect (e.g., via winter food availability) effects on year-round resident species. We do not believe that predation on adults or nests accounted for the observed synchrony. Dispersal among regional populations in this system may have played a role but is likely a product of the influence of regionally synchronous caterpillar fluctuations on bird reproduction. Long-term regional population trends may have contributed to the observed synchrony for some species, but we do not consider these trends to be primary factors. Our findings of population synchrony support the importance of food and climate in influencing forest bird abundances and have broad implications for potential responses of bird and insect populations to climate change.

AB Corridors that connect patches of disjunct habitat may be promising tools for mediating the negative impacts of habitat fragmentation, but little is known about how corridors affect ecological interactions. In eight 12-ha experimental landscapes, we examined how corridors affect the impact of invertebrate, rodent, and avian seed predators on pokeweed, Phytolacca americana. Over 13 months in 2000 and 2001, we quantified the effects of patch shape, connectivity, and predator type on the number of seeds germinating in the field (germinants), seed removal, and the viability of remaining seeds.
   Corridors did not affect the number of P. americana germinants in experimental exclosures or the viability of seeds remaining in exclosures. However, corridors affected the removal of seeds in a predator-specific manner: invertebrates removed more seeds in unconnected patches, whereas rodents removed more seeds in connected patches. Seed removal by birds was similar in connected and unconnected patches. Total seed removal by all seed predators was not affected by corridors, because invertebrates removed more seeds where rodents removed fewer seeds, and vice versa. Overall, seed predation significantly reduced the number and viability of remaining seeds, and reduced the number of germinants in 2000 but not in 2001. The abundance of naturally occurring P. americana plants in our experimental patches in 2000 decreased with increasing seed removal from exclosures but was not related to viability or germinants in 2000, suggesting that seed removal may shape the distribution and abundance of this species.
   Complementary patterns of seed removal by rodents and invertebrates suggest that corridors alter the effects of these predator taxa by changing the relative amounts of edge and core (nonedge) habitats in a patch. Because invertebrates and rodents do not completely overlap in the seeds they consume, corridors may change predation pressure on seeds that are primarily consumed by one predator type, with potential consequences for the composition of plant and seed predator communities.

AB A major challenge facing conservation biologists and wildlife managers is to predict how fauna will respond to habitat loss. Different species require different amounts of habitat for population persistence, and species' reproductive rates have been identified as one of the major factors affecting these habitat-amount requirements. The purpose of this study was to test the prediction that species with higher reproductive rates require less habitat for population persistence than species with lower reproductive rates. We used 41 species of forest breeding birds to test for a relationship between the annual reproductive output and the amount of forest cover at which each species has a 50% probability of presence in the landscape. To look at the presence of species over landscapes with varying amounts of forest cover, we combined two large-scale independent data sets: the North American Breeding Bird Survey and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) digital data. Species presence/absence information was determined over a 10-year window for 779 circular landscapes that surround each Breeding Bird Survey route in the central and eastern USA region. Annual reproductive rates were obtained-from the literature.
   There was a significant negative (interspecies) relationship between the estimated minimum habitat amount at which there was a 50% probability of presence in the landscape and annual reproductive output (F-1.39 = 7.71, P = 0.008, r(2) = 0.16). This is the first direct test for a negative relationship between minimum habitat requirements and annual reproductive rates.

AB Little is known about how density-independent and density-dependent processes affecting population dynamics vary geographically across species' ranges. To address this problem for three vertebrate species (Northern Bobwhite [Colinus virginianus], Ring-necked Pheasants [Phasianus colchicus], and eastern cottontails [Sylvilagus floridanus]), we examined spatially subdivided, long-term (1966-2001), seasonal (January, April, July, and October), time-series data from the Kansas Rural Mail Carrier Survey, USA. All three species have range boundaries in Kansas, with population abundances declining toward the periphery of their ranges. We quantified the strengths of density-dependent and density-independent processes affecting the dynamics of 10 populations of each species ranging from low (peripheral) to high (central) mean abundance using first-order autoregressive models that incorporate measurement error.
   For all three species, peripheral populations with lower mean abundance tended to have greater population variability. This pattern could potentially be explained by peripheral regions experiencing either weaker density dependence or greater environmentally driven density-independent fluctuations in per capita population growth rates. In general, density dependence did not vary among geographic regions, although there was a trend for smaller, peripheral populations to exhibit stronger density dependence. Density-independent variability in per capita population growth rates was higher in peripheral populations. Furthermore, density-independent fluctuations in per capita population growth rates were weakly correlated with temperature and precipitation and were highest for the period October through January, identifying fall as the period of greatest environmentally driven variability in population dynamics. Per capita population growth rates fluctuated in moderate synchrony among regions, especially for more abundant, nonperipheral populations in close geographical proximity.
   The strong density-dependent and stronger density-independent processes in smaller, peripheral populations suggest that the greater variability in peripheral populations' densities is caused by greater population sensitivity to environmental fluctuations. This may make peripheral populations more likely to go extinct and leads to the prediction that, if these species decline to the point of becoming endangered, this decline will be accompanied by a contraction in their geographical ranges.

AB In northern temperate lakes, algal abundance or chlorophyll levels are affected by phosphorus loading (P), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and food web effects from trophic cascades induced by anglers. To investigate how changes in land use and climate might affect future chlorophyll conditions in these lakes, we created a nonlinear model for take chlorophyll that considers the effects of these factors. Parameters were estimated for northern Wisconsin lakes. We show that resilience of the clear-water state in a single lake is maximized when P inputs are low, DOC is high, and angler pressure is low. We simulated a population of lakes to understand the current distribution of chlorophyll and resilience across lakes in the landscape. Under current conditions of land and lake use in the area, the model indicates that most lakes in the region are resilient clear-water lakes. Low chlorophyll levels, however, do not guarantee resiliency. Resilience shows a bimodal distribution suggesting that, with stochastic shocks or changing conditions, more lakes could shift to a high chlorophyll state that is costly to remediate. We also simulated a limnological comparative study to determine what conclusions would be drawn from a common research method if lacustrine ecosystem dynamics are indeed faithfully generated by our model. We show that phosphorus input will most often appear to be the most significant driver of lake chlorophyll levels, despite the fact that all mechanisms (including DOC and grazing) drive the dynamics. This finding suggests that long-standing debates in limnology about the primary drivers of algal abundance are explainable by differences in research approaches. This work brings together community and ecosystem ecology and shows how their processes can interact to drive higher-order feedbacks.

AB Plants in terrestrial systems obtain nitrogen primarily by root uptake from soil, yet current models of ecosystem nitrogen cycling assume little interaction of plant roots with the soil microbial community. The objective of this study was to determine how soil microorganisms in biological soil crusts interact with herbaceous plants for nitrogen in a pyrogenic ecosystem in Florida (USA), using a combination of natural abundance and tracer isotope methods. I demonstrate that plant nitrogen is strongly affected by interactions with mycorrhizal fungi and biological soil crusts. Measurements of nitrogenase activity indicated a high capacity of crusts to fix nitrogen that dramatically decreased after disturbance. Natural abundance of delta(15)N differed between arbuscular mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal herbs. When a small amount of enriched nitrogen was used as a tracer, crusts initially captured a greater amount of the N-15 that was added compared to plants, with some turnover of nitrogen from the crusts to plants observed after 15 days. Observations in this study indicate that crusts have more than one function in nitrogen dynamics: cyanobacteria in crusts fix nitrogen, crusts retain nitrogen in the system that would otherwise be lost to leaching. and though some of this nitrogen is available to plants, they also face competition from heterotrophic bacteria in crusts.

AB We performed a laboratory common-environment study to determine the genetic and environmental sources of variation in growth rates of the sagebrush lizard (Sceloporus graciosus). Hatchling lizards were reared from gravid females collected from three study populations along an elevational gradient in southern Utah, USA. Hatchlings were fed ad libidum and were maintained on a 14:10 light:dark cycle, with temperatures at 33degreesC and 21degreesC during photophase and scotophase, respectively. Each hatchling was randomly assigned to either a water-supplementation treatment or a control group receiving no supplemental water. Once every five days, the water-supplemented lizards were administered orally a quantity of water equal to 5% of their body mass. Growth was quantified as the total change in body size (length and mass) for 30 d after hatching. Resting metabolic rates of a subset of lizards were measured at hatching and at the end of the study. After adjusting growth for food intake, change in length did not differ between water-supplemented and control lizards, and did not differ among the three populations. Metabolic rates were similar across the study for all treatment groups. Water-supplemented lizards did gain wet mass more rapidly than control lizards; however, the difference in growth between groups was attributed to hydration state, because growth in dry mass did not differ between groups. The effects of water supplementation on growth that were observed by other investigators were likely manifested through changes in thermoregulatory behavior or increased activity.

AB Dormancy is a common mechanism employed by short-lived organisms for persistence in a variable environment. Theory suggests that the fraction of propagules that terminate dormancy each year should be <100% when recruitment success varies temporally. Moreover, the fraction of propagules that resumes development should vary across habitats that differ in the probability of successful recruitment or the probability of survival during dormancy. We tested these predictions by using dormant eggs from five populations of the freshwater cladoceran Daphnia pulicaria that differ in their ability to recruit to and persist in the water column. In two separate experiments, newly produced dormant eggs were incubated in situ for one year at various sites on the bottom of the lakes. A series of reciprocal transplants among four of these populations separated the effects of lake-specific environmental cues from the genetic and maternal effects of the different populations. Additional eggs were incubated in the laboratory under photoperiod-temperature combinations representative of those in the field. We found that the annual hatching fraction ranged from 6% to 50% among lakes, and that hatching fraction was primarily driven by environmental cues rather than being a result of the source of the eggs. However, laboratory incubations demonstrated significant differences among populations in the trajectories of the hatching curves, and a much higher rate of hatching than the field incubations. Our results suggest that variation in dormancy strategies within these systems is likely influenced both by the seasonal risk experienced by the active individuals and by risks associated with entering the dormant egg bank.

AB Theoretical models of community assembly predict a variety of possible assembly phenomena, but evidence for them in natural systems is hard to obtain because of problems of temporal scale and replication. We used laboratory experiments to investigate the potential assembly pathways in a small pool of protist species. Mapping the paths of assembly involved two steps: testing the ability of every possible species combination to persist, and testing each persistent community for its capacity to be invaded and changed by every other species from the pool. We then compared the properties of assembly in the experimental system with those predicted by theoretical models.
   We found that the number of community states and assembly paths was much smaller than theoretically possible, but that the system nonetheless had quite a complex range of assembly behaviors. There were many alternative paths to most communities, but overall, the species pool had just one state to which the paths eventually led. This absorbing state involved an oscillation between two communities, driven in part by a catalytic species that could persist in neither of them. Catalytic species have the property of invasion, changing the resident community, and then going extinct. In the species pool used here, only the predatory species acted as catalysts. Several communities capable of long-term persistence were unreachable by sequential assembly. One community had the property that it could not be reassembled from,the species it contained (a "Humpty-Dumpty" community).
   These results are for the most part in keeping with those from numerical simulations of community assembly, although there are certain discrepancies and new phenomena. The results also highlight the potential importance of long-term transient dynamics on assembly in natural systems.

AB Most field studies suggest that competition for nutrients is important in nutrient-limited systems. Nevertheless, the mechanisms, by which species avoid competition for nutrients in nutrient-poor but species-rich communities remain poorly understood. I used a model system, the carnivorous pitcher plant Sarracenia alata, to measure competition for nutrients. In a field competition experiment, I increased the potential for nutrient-niche overlap between established juvenile pitcher plants and their non-carnivorous neighbors by denying a unique source of nutrients (prey) to pitcher plants. Contrary. to predictions based on nutrient-niche complementarity, prey exclusion did not reduce the performance of pitcher plants competing with non-carnivorous neighbors., Hence, differences in nutrient-source specialization did not explain the coexistence of Sarracenia alata and its non-carnivorous neighbors in the field. Instead,, prey exclusion reduced the positive growth response to increased light following the removal of neighbors. By reducing allocation to pitchers in the presence of neighbors,, pitcher plants appeared to reduce their demand for nutrients when shaded. I hypothesize that carnivorous plants avoid competition with non-carnivorous plants by using changes in the light environment to cue adjustments in their demand for nutrients. I suggest that such plasticity is adaptive in any long-lived perennial plant that periodically experiences simultaneous pulses of light And nutrients during its lifetime (e.g., as might occur in fire-prone habitats).

AB Predawn plant water potential (Psi(w), measured with leaf psychrometers) and surrogate measurements made with the pressure chamber (termed Psi(pc) here) are used to infer comparative ecological performance, based on the expectation that these plant potentials reflect the wettest soil Psi(w) accessed by roots. There is growing evidence, however, that some species exhibit substantial predawn disequilibrium (PDD), defined as plant Psi(w) or Psi(pc) at predawn substantially more negative than the Psi(w) of soil accessed by roots. In the western Great Basin desert, the magnitude of PDD calculated as soil Psi(w) minus predawn leaf Psi(w) was as large as 1.4 and 2.7 MPa for two codominant shrub species, Chrysothamnus nauseosus and Sarcobatus vermiculatus, respectively. The magnitude of PDD calculated as soil Psi(w) minus predawn Psi(pc) was smaller, up to 0.6 and 2.1 MPa for Chrysothamnus and Sarcobatus, respectively. For both species, mechanisms contributing to PDD included night-time transpiration and putative leaf apoplastic solutes, but not hydraulic conductance limitations. Hydraulic lift also occurred in both species and likely contributed to PDD for Sarcobatus. Finding large magnitude PDD in field populations emphasizes that species differences in predawn plant Psi(w) or Psi(pc), do not necessarily reflect differences in accessible soil 41, and rooting depth, nor does a low predawn plant T, or Psi(pc) value necessarily mean that soil Psi(w), is also low. Mechanisms contributing to PDD affect relationships between plants and soil resources, as well as the potential for plant plant interactions.

AB Savanna ecosystems are characterized by the co-occurrence of trees and grasses. In this paper, we argue that the balance between trees and grasses is, to a large extent,determined by the indirect interactive effects of herbivory and fire. These effects are based on the positive feedback between fuel load (grass biomass) and fire intensity. An increase in the level of grazing leads to reduced fuel, load, which makes fire less intense and, thus, less damaging to trees and, consequently, results in an increase in woody vegetation. The system then switches from a state with trees and grasses to a state with solely trees. Similarly, browsers may enhance the effect of fire on trees because they reduce woody biomass, thus indirectly stimulating grass growth. This consequent increase in fuel load results in more intense fire and increased decline of biomass. The system then switches from a state with solely trees to a state with trees and grasses. We maintain that the interaction between fire and herbivory provides a mechanistic explanation for observed discontinuous changes in woody and grass biomass. This is an alternative for the soil degradation mechanism, in which there is a positive feedback between the amount of grass biomass and the amount of water that infiltrates into the soil. The soil degradation mechanism predicts no discontinuous changes, such as bush encroachment, on sandy soils. Such changes, however, are frequently observed. Therefore, the interactive effects of fire and herbivory provide a more plausible explanation for the occurrence of discontinuous changes in savanna ecosystems.

AB Most biological control systems involve a diverse community of natural enemies. We investigated how specialist and generalist natural enemies differ as biological control agents of pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisuin), and how interactions among natural enemies affect successful control. In alfalfa, pea aphids are attacked by a specialist parasitoid wasp, Aphidius ervi, and a guild of generalist predators primarily made up of Nabis and Orius bugs, coccinellid and carabid beetles, and web-building spiders. In three field experiments, we manipulated the parasitoid, then the generalist predator guild, and finally both classes of natural enemy, and recorded resulting impacts on pea aphid population control. The parasitoid caused little immediate reduction in aphid population growth but caused a large decline after a delay corresponding to the generation time of the parasitoid. In contrast, the generalist guild caused an immediate decline in the aphid population growth rate. However, the generalists did not exert density-dependent control, so aphid densities continued to increase throughout the experiment. The third field experiment in which we simultaneously manipulated parasitoids and predators investigated the possibility of "non-additive effects" on aphid control. Densities of parasitoid pupae were 50%, lower in the presence of generalist predators, indicating intraguild predation. Nonetheless, the ratio of parasitoids to aphids was not changed, and the impact of the two types of natural enemies was additive.
   We constructed a stage-structured model of aphid. parasitoid, and predator dynamics and fit the model to data from our field experiments. The model supports the additivity of parasitoid and predator effects on aphid suppression but suggests that longer-term experiments (32 d rather than 20 d) would likely reveal nonadditive effects as predation removes parasitoids whose response to aphid densities occurs with a delay. The model allowed us to explore additional factors that could influence the additivity of parasitoid and predator effects, Aphid density-dependent population growth and predator immigration in response to aphid density would likely have little influence on the additivity between parasitism and predation. However, if a parasitoid were to show a strong Type II functional response, in contrast to A. ervi whose functional response is nearly Type I, interactions with predators would likely be synergistic. These analyses reveal factors that should be investigated in other systems to address whether parasitism and predation act additively on host densities.

AB Dividing sister pairs of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana (reared in a common environment) between high and low temperature shows that oviposition temperature induces a plastic response in egg size. Females at a lower temperature laid significantly larger (but fewer) eggs than their sisters kept at a higher temperature, whereas total reproductive investment increased with temperature. Cross-transfer experiments demonstrated that this plastic response in egg size is reversible. Interestingly, this pattern parallels an almost universal temperature-induced developmental response in ectotherm body size. In both cases, however, we do not yet understand the underlying mechanisms or the potential adaptive significance.
   By cross-transferring the experimentally manipulated eggs between temperatures, we showed that the larger eggs produced at a lower temperature had a higher hatching success, and yielded larger hatchlings with a slightly higher probability of reaching maturity and shorter larval development time (at the lower temperature) compared to the smaller eggs produced at a higher temperature. Overall, the lower temperature was slightly more detrimental for smaller than for larger eggs. The slight differences in survival across temperatures, together with more substantial differences in fecundity, indicate that it could pay off to produce fewer but larger offspring (with increased fitness) at a lower temperature, but more and smaller offspring at a higher temperature where offspring survival was generally high. Our data present for the first time evidence that selection may favor larger eggs at a lower temperature, and thus that a. plastic response. of egg size to temperature in ectotherms could be adaptive.

AB Many organisms exploit highly variable food supplies and, as an adaptation to such conditions, show elevated growth during recovery from starvation. In some species this response enables starved and re-fed individuals to outpace those growing continuously.
   The main engine of compensatory growth is a relative increase in food ingestion as a reaction to poor nutritional condition. We use a series of mathematical energy-budget models to investigate the interaction between the mechanisms that control such hyperphagia and those that control internal allocation, with the aim of identifying those strategies that permit overcompensation.
   We find that hyperphagia alone normally produces weak compensation and can never result in overcompensation. When combined with internal allocation, which routes a fixed fraction of net production to reserves, a strong compensatory response becomes the norm, and overcompensation is frequent.

AB Many nonexperimental studies have shown positive correlations between resource abundance and vertebrate abundance. These relationships, however, are difficult to interpret because of confounding factors that may independently determine the abundance of vertebrates and their resources. Moreover, verifying links between vertebrate and resource abundance is complex because human perception of resource abundance may differ from that of nonhuman vertebrates and because manipulating resource abundance on an ecologically meaningful scale is difficult.
   We studied the dependency of frugivores on fruit abundance in eastern Amazonian floodplain forests dominated by one species of palm tree (Euterpe oleracea) from which people harvest fruit. We first compared spatial and temporal use by frugivorous parrots of four sites dominated by E. oleracea and four sites with no E. oleracea. Parrots spent 48-92% more time in the former, where their activity over the fruiting season mirrored the abundance of fruits. To test whether fruit abundance was the mechanism underlying these patterns, we removed fruit at two intensities in replicated 1.8-ha plots, and then monitored responses of frugivorous birds and mammals. High-intensity removal (75% of ripe fruit harvested) significantly reduced the number of frugivorous bird individuals by 29% and the length of frugivorous bird visits by 68%, relative to controls. In contrast, low-intensity removal (41% of ripe fruit removed) had no impact on these metrics. Frugivore species richness did not differ among treatments and controls, but the composition of the frugivore community was altered by harvest, with the presence of 11 species being linked to fruit abundance. Nonfrugivorous birds did not respond to either intensity of fruit harvest. The number of fruit-eating mammal species was 58% lower in both the low- and high-removal treatments, relative to control plots.
   These results verify that fruit abundance influences the species composition of frugivore communities and the abundance and foraging behavior of individual species. They also document short-term dependency of fruit-eating mammals on fruit abundance. Harvest of fruit from forest systems, a common practice in tropical forests, therefore can affect populations of fruit-eating animals.

AB Cave stream food webs rely exclusively on detritus from the surface for energy and represent a heterotrophic end point in the continuum of stream types. Both dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulate organic matter, and associated microbes, are available in caves, but the relative importance of these foods is unclear. We examined trophic structure and the roles of particulate organic matter and DOM retained in epilithic biofilms in three cave streams using natural abundance isotopes (C-13 and N-15) and C-13 tracer additions. Natural abundance N-15 ratios showed that cave animals occupied two trophic levels: primary consumers and predators. Epilithic biofilms and animals were highly enriched in N-15, suggesting that dissolved organic matter from surface soils was incorporated into epilithon and supported stream food webs, even when coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) from the surface was abundant. We conducted 28-day C-13-acetate tracer additions to trace the use of epilithon carbon in the food webs. The tracer(13)C acetate was rapidly taken up in the streams at uptake velocities (0.5-22.8 x 10(-5) m/s) and uptake rates (0.04-0.23 mg m(-2) h(-1)) similar to those in surface streams. Epilithon was highly labeled and epilithon turnover time was relatively long (10.0-16.7 d), showing that C from DOM was immobilized in biofilms and thus available to invertebrates, which also became labeled with tracer by the end of the experiment. Several snails (Fontigens tartarea, Gyraulus parvus, and Physa sp.) that fed directly on epilithon were highly enriched with tracer C-13. Other primary consumers (Gammarus minus and Caecidotea holsingeri) fed on a combination of epilithon and fine particulate organic matter. Predators in the streams (Stygobromus emarginatus, S. spinatus, and Macrocotyla hoffmasteri) also became labeled with C-13, indicating that biofilm C was passed through the entire food web. This study shows that DOC and epilithic biofilms are important energy sources for stream communities even when CPOM is an abundant resource.

AB Recent studies have suggested that plant-pollinator interactions may be less specialized than previously thought. We contrasted patterns of specialization observed in five plant-pollinator interaction webs with predictions based on null models. In the five data sets, the observed number of extreme specialists and extreme generalists was significantly higher than the null expectation. This pattern was mostly due to a positive correlation between species frequency of interaction (f) and their estimated degree of generalization (s). After accounting for this association, the expected frequency distribution of degree of specialization generated by the null model closely matched the observed frequency distribution in the five data sets. A second null model, which explicitly incorporated the correlation between f and s, also generated expected frequency distributions of specialization that closely resemble those observed in the data sets. To make progress in understanding the distribution of degree of specialization in pollination systems it will be necessary not only to improve the quality of the data and to refine methods used to quantify specialization, but also to answer the question of why more frequently interacting species appear to be more generalized.

AB Artificial Selection is used by quantitative geneticists to examine the genetic variances and covariances that underlie the evolution of traits that show continuous phenotypic variation. Such traits are crucial for adaptive evolution in natural populations. Here, I discuss the extent to which artificial selection experiments can provide insights about both the proximate and ultimate causes of adaptive evolution. In particular, such experiments can explore the basis of interactions among traits, and the potential consequences of genetic coupling of traits for the paths taken during evolution. They can also yield phenotypes of relevance to examining the reasons why differences in reproductive success and fitness occur. I focus here on the methodology, with particular reference to examples from investigations of the evolution of the development of morphologies and of phenotypic plasticity.

AB In this study, I experimentally examined how the landscape matrix influenced the movement, oviposition behavior, and spatial distribution of Anagrus columbi, a common egg parasitoid of the planthopper Prokelisia crocea. Both species exist among discrete patches of prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata), the sole host plant of P. crocea. Based on out-planted cordgrass pots bearing host eggs (to assess parasitism) or sticky leaves (traps for adult A. columbi), I found that the distribution of adult female A. columbi and pattern of ovipositions within a cordgrass patch were strongly matrix dependent. Female densities were 59% lower on the edge than interior of patches embedded in a mudflat matrix, but were evenly distributed within patches embedded in a matrix consisting of either native grasses or the exotic grass smooth brome (Bromus inermis). In contrast, parasitism was higher in the interior than edge for patches in all three matrix types. The lack of correspondence between A. columbi density and parasitism was attributed to differences in oviposition behavior: A. columbi parasitized 71% more hosts per capita in the interior than edge for patches embedded in nonhost grasses, but equal numbers on the edge and interior of patches embedded in mudflat. Matrix-dependent differences in the within-patch distribution and oviposition behavior of A. columbi can influence the distribution of parasitism risk and host-parasitoid stability at the patch level.
   Matrix composition also affected the pattern of movement through the matrix and the colonization of nearby cordgrass patches. Anagrus columbi females emigrating from a mudflat-embedded patch were captured at very low, but constant, numbers with distance out into the matrix, suggesting that they were reluctant to enter or remain in the mudflat. In contrast, A. columbi females entering a nonhost grass matrix had numbers that were high near the patch border and then declined exponentially with distance. These patterns of movement were likely responsible for the very different colonization rates for experimental patches embedded in different matrix types and located 3 m from a source patch of A. columbi. Patches embedded in brome were colonized at a rate that was 3.0 and 5.7 times higher than for patches in native grass or mudflat, respectively. Finally, based on a census of cordgrass patches spanning five generations, A. columbi densities and proportion of patches occupied generally increased with increasing host density, patch isolation, and the proportion of the surrounding matrix that was mudflat. Patch size had no effect on the distribution of A. columbi. Overall, these data suggest that cordgrass patches in a nonhost grass matrix, particularly smooth brome, have high connectivity relative to patches in a mudflat matrix. Changes in connectivity due to changes in matrix composition can significantly influence host-parasitoid persistence at the metapopulation level.

AB We use a simple model of ecosystem management to demonstrate that apparently rational management approaches can lead to ecological collapse. Our model of the ecosystem management of lake eutrophication integrates lake dynamics, management decision-making, and learning in a framework that is deliberately simplified to highlight the role of model uncertainty. The simulated lake can switch between alternate eutrophic and oligotrophic states. Managers consider two management models of the lake, one for an oligotrophic lake and the other for a eutrophic lake. As managers observe the lake varying from year to year, they estimate how well each of the two management models is supported by the observed data. Management policies maximize the expected net present value of the lake. Even under optimistic assumptions about environmental variation, learning ability, and management control, conventional decision theory and optimal control approaches fail to stabilize ecological dynamics. Rather, these methods drive ecosystems into cycles of collapse and recovery. We suggest how scientists could help prevent ecosystem management from driving ecosystems toward collapse.

AB Although plants and other sessile organisms often disperse in a prevailing direction, the ecological consequences of this are poorly understood. To explore patterns of plant diversity similar to those found in a California river system, I modeled perennial plant populations and communities occurring in a linear series of neighborhoods connected by dispersal, where dispersal occurs in a prevailing downstream direction. Simulations demonstrated that population size and species diversity correlated with dispersal and increased downstream, but only if fecundity and death rates were such that neighborhoods within the system depended on external propagule input for their persistence. Highly effective downstream dispersal and some upstream dispersal were also required. If these demographic and dispersal criteria were met, communities with intense competition and inhibition still developed downstream increases in diversity. Additionally, in such systems, directional dispersal could favor species coexistence since upstream neighborhoods provided a refuge for inferior competitors. The demographic and dispersal criteria were relaxed for systems recovering from scattered source populations following disturbance. I conclude that directional dispersal may be a key determinant of species coexistence and patterns of diversity in severely propagule-limited systems.

AB Rhizosphere interactions are affected by many different regulatory signals. As yet, however, only a few have been identified. Signals, by definition, contain information, react with a receptor, and elicit a response. Signals may thus represent the highest level of evolved response in rhizosphere communities and, in that sense, occupy a supreme control point. At the same time, some signals may function as modulators of downstream responses, rather than on/off switches. To assess these possibilities, several interactions between plants and soil organisms are described, starting with the molecular interactions between leguminous plants and symbiotic bacteria of the family Rhizobiaceae, one of the best-characterized plant-microbe associations in the rhizosphere. We then examine other interactions between plants and soil organisms for overlap and/or connections with the rhizosphere signals utilized in the legume-Rhizobium symbiosis. Whether information currently available reflects the interaction of the organisms in nature or only in the laboratory has not always been determined. Thus, the key ecological issue of how important some of the signals are under field conditions remains to be addressed. Molecular tools now available make this task less daunting than in the past, and thus a new age of experimental field ecology may soon burst forth in rhizosphere studies. By identifying the signals, receptors, and the critical control points, we can better understand the organismal dynamics in this key belowground ecosystem.

AB Trophic polyphenisms are examples of phenotypic plasticity where two or more morphs within a species exploit different food niches. In this context, induced traits that enhance feeding ability on certain prey types have been termed inducible offenses. Here, we describe a prey-induced continuous size polyphenism in the predatory ciliate Lembadion bullinum.
   Further to previous reports of "giant cannibals" in this species, we show that Lembadion is able to gradually adjust its size to the size of its prey. Large size acts as an inducible offense, since large morphs have an increased gape-size and can exploit a wider food range than small morphs. Despite-these benefits, large morphs reduce their size whenever small prey is available. This suggests that their fitness is governed by a trade-off. We experimentally demonstrate this trade-off by showing that, when offered small prey, large morphs achieve lower volume-specific feeding rates and lower maximal population growth rates than small morphs. Both results highlight that large morphs suffer demographic costs that make them inferior in small-prey environments. Consequently, inducible predator offenses may evolve as adaptations to situations where important prey characteristics vary with space or time.

AB I studied 787 female and 510 male Prothonotary Warblers (Protonotaria citrea) breeding,in southern Illinois, USA, from 1994 to 2000 to test two competing hypotheses that may explain between-year breeding-site fidelity in migratory birds. I experimentally manipulated the nesting success of randomly chosen female (n = 187) and male (n = 139) warblers during 1997-2000 to test the "decision rules" hypothesis. The site fidelity of individuals increased significantly with an increase in the number of broods produced (zero, one, or two) and >80% of those that were double-brooded returned to sites the following year. Territory fidelity of individuals that returned to study sites also increased with increased reproductive success. The "renesting stress" hypothesis was not supported because site fidelity was unaffected by the number of nesting attempts made. Site fidelity did not differ between sexes, but territory fidelity was higher for males than for females. Mate fidelity, age, and brood parasitism by cowbirds had little effect on site and territory fidelity. Nesting success on Prothonotary Warbler territories was predictable between years, and individuals benefited by returning to territories where two broods were produced or by dispersing from territories where no broods were produced. These results support the decision rules hypothesis and demonstrate a causal relationship whereby individuals use their own reproductive experience at a site to assess the current and potential future quality of the location and then respond accordingly by returning or not returning. Decision rules may allow these birds to avoid sites with chronically high rates of nest predation and to concentrate in areas where nesting success is high.

AB Soil pathogens close to mature Prunus serotina trees reduce the survival of conspecific seedlings. We examined whether the soil community associated with P. scrotina trees has continued negative effects on seedling growth. P. serotina seedlings and saplings were harvested after being followed for 1-3 years in the field, and above- and belowground biomasses were measured. Linear regression models including distance to adult P. serotina tree, conspecific seedling density. and seedling age explained 13.9% of the variation in biomass. Distance and age were positively correlated with total biomass, while density as negatively correlated with total biomass. A similar model for saplings established prior to the beginning of the study, and of unknown age, predicted 11.3% of the variation in total biomass, with distance to adult positively correlated with biomass.
   To separate the effects of distance from density and remove confounding environmental factors, seedlings were grown in the greenhouse at high or low density in soil collected 0-5 m or 25-30 m from adult P. serotina trees. Half of the soil collected at each distance was sterilized by autoclaving. The experiment was repeated in 1998 and 1999, and in both years there was a significant sterilization-by-distance interaction, Sterilization of soil collected close to the tree resulted in higher root: shoot ratios, while sterilization of soil collected away from the tree resulted in lower root:shoot ratios, This suggests that soil biota vary with distance to adults and that elimination of soil biota changes plant allocation patterns differentially with distance.
   Distance-dependent effects of soilborne pathogens may continue beyond seedling mortality and suppress juvenile growth. Reduced growth could increase an individual's, chance of later mortality, suggesting that initial escape front damping-off pathogens close to parental trees does not ensure longer-term survival.

AB In an age- or stage- structured population, a given change on a proportional scale of different fitness components has different effects on the population growth rate. Because earlier studies have shown that variability is selectively disadvantageous for long-lived iteroparous species, fitness components whose variation has greatest impact on the population growth rate are expected to be canalized against temporal variability. We present here a test for such a canalization of fitness components most influential for population growth. If canalization occurs, (1) within a given population the variance of canalized fitness components should be less than that of noncanalized components, and (2) among populations an inverse relationship should occur between the potential demographic impact of fitness components and their temporal variability. We tested these hypotheses using data on age-dependent survival of ungulates. As expected for long-lived vertebrates, elasticities and sensitivities of adult survival were consistently higher than for juvenile survival. In support of the canalization hypothesis, the variance of juvenile survival with low potential demographic impact on fitness was consistently higher than the variance of adult survival with high potential demographic impact on fitness, in all of 22 ungulate populations for which long-term demographic monitoring data were available. However, a negative co-variation between potential impact on fitness and temporal variation could also be accounted for by alternative hypotheses, the lower resistance of growing individuals to environmental "insults," or reduced adult phenotypic variability due to selective mortality of juveniles. To differentiate between canalization of adult survival and frailty/selective mortality of juveniles, we included five populations of small mammals. We then found a negative relationship between the relative potential impact of age-dependent survival on fitness and the relative variability of age-dependent survival, especially for populations faced with high environmental variation. This remained true after correcting for differences in mean survival of juveniles and adults and was independent of phylogeny. Although more data are required to extend the hypothesis to other taxonomic groups, we conclude that available data support the idea that adult survival of ungulates is canalized against temporal variation. Therefore, contrasted responses of juvenile and prime-age survival to environmental variaton in ungulates may be adaptive and could be viewed as a bet-hedging strategy.

AB We investigated. effects of light and nutrients on whole plant growth, eco-physiology, and leaf chemistry of Eucalyptus nitens seedlings, and the effect of these characteristics on herbivory by common brushtail possums (Trichosurus, vulpecula) and red-bellied pademelons (Thylogale billardierii). We compared results of the response of plant secondary chemistry to changes in environmental conditions against two contrasting hypotheses: (1) the carbon:nutrient balance hypothesis (CNBH) and (2) the photoinhibition hypothesis. Nutrient and light levels affected relative growth rate and leaf area ratio of seedlings. Electron transport rates and optimum photochemical efficiencies indicated different rates of carbon fixation between treatments, consistent with levels of chlorophyll and xanthophyll pigments. Nonphotochernical quenching and xanthophylls per unit chlorophyll were negatively correlated with total chlorophyll content. Consistent with the photoinhibition hypothesis, levels of leaf phenolics (flavonols, hydrolyzable tannins, and sideroxylonals) per unit chlorophyll were also negatively correlated with. total chlorophyll content. In contrast, phenolic levels on a dry-mass basis were not consistent with predictions of the CNBH; they were better explained as A response to severity of photoinhibition than by reallocation of resources from growth to defense. Total essential oil and cineole levels were positively correlated with nitrogen levels, but there was an interaction in their response to nutrients and light. Thus, levels of essential oils were not well predicted by the CNBH. Sideroxylonal and cineole levels were not correlated, and we hypothesize that different processes and requirements drive their production. Intake of seedlings by possums and pademelons was not directly negatively correlated with levels of hydrolyzable tannins, sideroxylonals, or essential oils. An interaction of the costs of these compounds against benefits of nitrogen levels may explain patterns in intake. We suggest that, while environmentally induced levels of carbon-based plant secondary metabolites have consequences for herbivory, photoinhibition may drive the adjustment of levels of leaf phenolics in response to variation in light and nutrients. This contrasts with the view that these adjustments represent a trade-off in resource allocation between growth and defense.

AB The natural complexity of ecological communities regularly lures ecologists to collect elaborate data sets in which confounding factors are often present. Although multiple regression is commonly used in such cases to test the individual effects of many explanatory variables on a continuous response, the inherent collinearity (multicollinearity) of confounded explanatory variables encumbers analyses and threatens their statistical and inferential interpretation. Using numerical simulations, I quantified the impact of multicollinearity on ecological multiple regression and found that even low levels of collinearity bias analyses (r greater than or equal to 0.28 or r(2) greater than or equal to 0.08), causing (1) inaccurate model parameterization, (2) decreased statistical power, and (3) exclusion of significant predictor variables during model creation. Then, using real ecological data, I demonstrated the utility of various statistical techniques for enhancing the reliability and interpretation of ecological multiple regression in the presence of multicollinearity.

AB Pulsed resources, such as natural and anthropogenic inputs of nutrients into natural communities, can have important consequences for primary productivity, as well as for consumers and their predators. Little, however, is known of how a resource pulse influences community assemblages for periods longer than one growing season. This study, repeated twice and in two different habitats on a mid-Atlantic Spartina alterniflora salt marsh, showed that a one-time nitrogen (N) subsidy can have not only significant within-year effects on plant primary production and herbivore and natural enemy abundance, but can also have long-term effects on plants and arthropod food web structure.
   Spartina plants exhibited significantly greater biomass for 2-3 yr and elevated percentage of N for up to two years following the nutrient pulse, an effect that had direct positive effects on herbivores that were sensitive to variation in plant N content. Populations of Prokelisia planthoppers (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) were elevated in fertilized plots for up to three years following the nutrient addition. However, Trigonotylus uhleri, an herbivorous mirid (Hemiptera: Miridae), was more abundant on previously fertilized plants only for a brief time, either within the same season as the nutrient addition, or for only one year after the pulse. The carryover effect of the nutrient pulse on plants and herbivores also propagated to the third trophic level. Both non-lycosid spiders (mostly linyphiids) and a specialist egg predator of Spartina planthoppers (Tytthus vagus) were more abundant in previously fertilized plots for up to two years following the nutrient pulse. In contrast, wolf spider (Lycosidae) densities were elevated in fertilized plots only within the same season as the initial fertilization pulse. Food web structure, as indexed by herbivore: predator ratio, was altered in plots that received a one-time N subsidy, with the arthropod food web in fertilized Spartina taking three years to resemble that of unperturbed Spartina. The response of particular herbivores and predators to the nutrient pulse was in part habitat dependent (contiguous Spartina meadows vs. isolated islets), suggesting that habitat heterogeneity combined with the differential dispersal ability of arthropods can influence the long-term response of a food web to a nutrient pulse.

AB Species and their abundances change along environmental gradients, and populations of some species are decimated by introductions of foreign species. We show that the prey-to-predator species ratio is resistant to change. We determined that ratios were about 3:1 for 50 lakes with diversity ranging from 5 to 58 taxa, and with a total combined fauna of 140 insects, crustaceans, and fish. The prey-to-predator ratio range (1.25:1 to 5.20:1) was only 9% of the potential range. Ratios were not related to chemical, thermal, or physical characteristics of lakes. Ratios were generally the same for fishless lakes, for lakes with one or two introduced predators (salmonids), and for lakes with more complex communities with up to 14 predators including five fish species. For the simplest model, this suggests that when a fish species is introduced and becomes established in a lake there is a fundamental ecological compensatory adjustment with either a three species increase in the diversity of prey or the loss of a predator (but no change in diversity). However, we show more complex prey-predator ratio changes occur because certain keystone species regulated community structure and prey diversity. When the keystone fish (a predatory salmonid) was removed from five lakes, the penultimate littoral predator (lake chub) occupied both the pelagic and littoral zones. Consequently, amphipod density decreased, chironomid density increased, and total zooplankton and benthic diversity increased by 31% or 7.8 taxa per lake on average. The mean prey-predator ratio for these five lakes increased significantly from 2.32:1 to 4.16:1. These community based prey-predator ratios were established by single keystone species from their influence on prey, other predators, and community structure.

AB We model the effects of stochastic fluctuations in sex ratio on the demographic stochasticity in populations with two sexes. Two different mating systems, purely polygamous and purely monogamous, are considered. For both systems, the fluctuation in sex ratio adds a large component to the demographic variance. For long-lived species, there will be a large temporal autocorrelation in the sex ratio that affects the components of the demographic variance. For monogamous mating systems, the fluctuations in sex ratio may also cause an Allee effect. These effects need to be taken into account when modeling two-sex populations without explicitly using separate counts of males and females, but only the total population size.

AB Understanding the nature and causes of global gradients in species richness is a perennial ecological problem, and recent work has highlighted the need to assess these gradients relative to an appropriate statistical expectation. This paper examines latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in species richnesses of corals and reef fishes in the Indo-Pacific domain and compares them with gradients predicted by a mid-domain model in which geographic domains are located at random between the latitudinal and longitudinal boundaries-of this region. We test for significant differences between observed and predicted species-richness patterns, and we identify regions that are enriched or depauperate in species, relative to expectation. In addition, we move beyond previous mid-domain analyses by directly comparing observed spatial distributions of geographic ranges with those predicted by a mid-domain model. This comparison indicates precisely how species-richness anomalies are produced by nonrandomness in the distribution of species ranges. For both corals and fishes, large and statistically significant differences exist between observed latitudinal and longitudinal species-richness gradients and those predicted by mid-domain models. Longitudinally, species richness is markedly higher than predicted along the African coast and, to a lesser extent, within the Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA), and it is markedly lower than expected in the eastern Pacific. Latitudinally, species richness becomes increasingly higher than predicted as one moves from the equator to the tropical margins; then it becomes sharply lower than predicted beyond the tropics. Unexpectedly, differences between observed and predicted spatial distributions of range endpoints and midpoints reveal a pattern of nonrandomness that is highly congruent with the hypothesis that gyres in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, with the IAA forming a porous boundary between them, have a-major influence on Indo-Pacific species-richness patterns. Our analyses indicate that the perspective offered by a focus on explaining nonrandomness in the location of geographic ranges (rather than explaining why species, numbers vary in space) is likely to dramatically alter our assessments of alternative explanations for global species-richness gradients.

AB Indirect effects, in which one species affects another through an intermediate species, can occur by changes in either the density or the traits of the intermediate species. Ecologists have focused primarily on density-mediated indirect effects, but have become interested in quantifying the relative sizes of trait- and density-mediated indirect effects. We examined how state-dependent prey behavior and experimental protocols affect the sizes of measured trait- and density-mediated indirect effects in a three-species chain (predator, prey, and resource). We found that the size of trait-mediated indirect effects relative to the size of density-mediated indirect effects increases as the level of resources increases. We also found that the relative contributions of trait- and density-mediated indirect effects depend on the timing of manipulations in relation to the state of individuals and their vulnerability to predators. In addition, we found that trait-mediated indirect effects that have been measured during a portion of a season may diminish or disappear when measured across a whole season because of behavioral compensation. These results show that the relative contributions of trait- and density-mediated indirect effects in a system will be variable, and experiments need to be designed to account for dynamic systems.

AB Amphibians are often thought to have a metapopulation structure, which may render them vulnerable to habitat fragmentation. The red-spotted toad (Bufo punctatus) in the southwestern United States and Mexico commonly inhabits wetlands that have become much smaller and fewer since the late Pleistocene. This study tests two predictions based on metapopulation theory, that the incidence of habitat patch occupancy is directly related to patch size and that it is inversely related to patch isolation, and a third, potentially competing hypothesis, that patch occupancy is influenced by local environmental conditions. In a 20 000 km(2) area of the eastern Mojave Desert, 128 potential habitat patches (primarily springs) were identified and surveyed for local environmental characteristics and presence/ absence of B. punctatus. Patch size metrics reflected extent of water and riparian vegetation of several types. Patch isolation metrics were based on nearest-neighbor distances, calculated both as Euclidian distance and distance via connecting drainage channels. B. punctatus was found at 73% of the sites, including all of the 16 historic (pre-1970) sites. Patches were generally quite small, with water extending a median distance of only 200 m and median area of 72 m. Median nearest-neighbor distances among patches were 1.8 km Euclidian distance (range: 0.4-22.0 km) and 6.8 km via drainage channels (range: 0.5-64.9 km). Based on stepwise multiple logistic regression, the incidence of patch occupancy increased significantly with patch size and was also significantly related to elevation, latitude, and four metrics that were associated with rocky terrain, periodic scouring water flows, and ephemeral water. In contrast, incidence of patch occupancy was not significantly related to patch isolation. These findings are consistent with a "patchy population" model, rather than the classical equilibrium metapopulation model, implying frequent dispersal among patches and virtually no local extinctions. We speculate that B. punctatus in the Mojave Desert today occurs primarily in a patchy population or populations within mountain ranges that are isolated from patchy populations in other ranges. The influence of local environmental characteristics on patch occupancy demonstrates the importance of including patch quality metrics in tests of predictions for patch occupancy based on metapopulation theory.

AB Resources influence consumer physiology, behavior, population growth, interspecific interactions, and community structure. To understand fully the influence of resources on interactions among consumer populations and community structure, it may be necessary to understand the influence of resources on individual behavior. In the first part of this study, we examined how resource type influenced foraging behavior and interactions in a guild of omnivorous desert ants. Cafeteria experiments showed that Myrmecocystus depilis, M. mimicus, and Aphaenogaster cockerelli prefer protein resources to seed resources. However, A. cockerelli collects mostly seed resources, and M. depilis and M. mimicus collect mostly protein resources when faced with competition from one another. A temporary removal experiment showed that the effect of M. mimicus and M. depilis on A. cockerelli depended on resource type. At protein resources, Myrmecocystus foragers tended to displace A. cockerelli foragers, but at seed resources, there was no effect of one species on the other.
   In the second part of this study, we tested how resource availability may influence the arrangement of species in ecological dominance hierarchies. We found that there was considerable variation among sites in the arrangement of species, and that variation could be attributed to variation in resource availability and in the effect of particular species among sites. Our results suggest that the outcome of interactions between individuals are resource dependent, because individuals respond to resources in different ways. Furthermore, resource-dependent interactions and behavior can lead to communities that are arranged in intransitive dominance hierarchies, which may promote biodiversity at regional scales.

AB The importance and strength of density dependence continue,,, to engender debate because of its central importance to Population dynamics and regulation. Here, we show how confounding effects of site quality can mask strong effects of density dependence. In particular, we explore spatiotemporal variation and covariation among (1) densities of newly settled coral reef fish (Thalassoma hardwicke). (2) environmental characteristics, and (3) the strength of density-dependent mortality. Environmental features of patch reefs were spatially and temporally variable and influenced density-dependent survival. Higher-quality sites (i.e., reefs possessing features that yield greater numbers of recruits at any given settlement level) received greater settlement, and this relationship masked the operation of density dependence when variation in quality among sites (or times) was not distinguished (a common approach in many observational studies of density dependence). Our work illustrates how spatiotemporal covariation in settlement density, and site quality can obscure patterns of density dependence at larger scales, contributing to a phenomenon we call "cryptic density dependence." Acknowledging patterns and consequences of covariance may alter the way we study population dynamics. especially of marine organisms, where the link between processes that affect settlement and post-settlement survival remains relatively poorly understood.

AB The aggregation model of species coexistence predicts that insect species diversity within a community is maintained by intraspecific aggregation among re source patches. An untested corollary of this prediction is that diversity within resource patches should decrease with increasing intraspecific aggregation. The recently derived species-aggregation relationship provides a general formulation of this prediction: as intraspecific aggregation increases within a geographic area., the species richness within samples of the area decreases. We tested this prediction by compiling and analyzing 76 data sets of arthropod species distribution and abundance. For each data set, we determined the mean amount of intra- and interspecific aggregation and three types of within-sample or local species diversity: species richness, evenness, and dominance. Using regression, we found a negative relationship between intraspecific aggregation and all three types of local diversity. Intraspecific aggregation explained a significant percentage of the variation in species diversity, typically between 20% and 60%. By comparison, interspecific aggregation usually explained <1% of the variation in species diversity. Our study provides empirical support for the species-aggregation relationship as a general macroecological pattern that emerges from intraspecific aggregation.

AB The transfer of organisms among patches is a key process influencing the spatial structure and regional dynamics of a population; yet, detailed experimental studies of animal movement among patches are uncommon. I performed a series of mark-recapture studies to quantify the movement of a planthopper, Prokelisia crocea (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), among discrete patches of its host plant, prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata). Results from these dispersal studies were used to predict the natural distributions and to characterize the spatial population structure of P. crocea. Planthopper emigration loss per patch increased linearly with the density of female conspecifics and was nonlinearly related to patch size (small > large > intermediate sized patches). Planthopper spatial spread was diffusive and 2.7 times faster among cordgrass patches in a heterogeneous habitat (patches embedded in nonhost vegetation) than within a homogeneous habitat (pure cordgrass). Immigration by planthoppers was an increasing function of patch size but was independent of patch isolation (at the scale of this study). The natural distribution of planthoppers in a prairie fragment, obtained from a survey of 146 cordgrass patches over five generations, was well predicted from the dispersal experiments. Planthopper densities and patch occupancy rates were positively correlated with patch size (cordgrass patches greater than or equal to0.8 ha were continually occupied), but uncorrelated with patch isolation. Based on this survey, the rate of patch extinction was 21% per generation, highest in small and moderately isolated patches, and approximately equal to the recolonization rate per generation. Finally, the dynamics of local patch populations were asynchronous, even for patch pairs <10 m apart. I conclude that P. crocea exhibits a population structure most closely resembling a mainland-island metapopulation, but with high patch connectivity. Under these circumstances, processes operating within the few mainland patches are probably more important than regional processes (patch extinctions/recolonizations) in influencing population persistence.

AB Propagule dispersal is fundamental in regulating the strength of demographic and genetic interactions between individuals both within and among populations. I studied spatiotemporal variability in propagule (zoospore) supply of a continuously reproducing seaweed, giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, to examine: (1) the extent to which local zoospore production is coupled to (correlated with) temporal variability in zoospore supply; and (2) spatial variability in the strength of such coupling. Macrocystis pyrifera planktonic zoospores were quantified from seawater samples pumped on numerous dates in 1999 from just above the substratum at various sites in the Point Loma kelp forest, southern California, USA. Zoospore collections were made at a site in the forest interior approximately three times per month from late February through mid-November. Sample collection overlapped with complete demographic surveys of the local population (100 m(2)) to determine local reproductive output. Temporal variability in zoospore supply was strongly correlated with relative changes in the density and size structure of local reproductive adult sporophytes; 76% of variability in zoospore supply was explained by local reproductive output. This tight coupling between zoospore supply and local reproduction appeared to be driven by low-displacement, oscillating currents in the forest interior due to the cumulative drag of adult sporophytes, which kept zoospores close to their release site. High coupling between zoospore supply and local reproduction was validated at two additional interior sites separated by 1 km; 78% of variability in zoospore supply was explained by local reproductive output at these sites. Due to lower sporophyte densities, however, the forest edges experienced rapid, unidirectional currents that appeared to transport zoospores far from their release site, effectively decoupling zoospore supply from local reproduction; only 38% of variability in zoospore supply was explained by local reproductive output at these sites. The results suggest that the size of and location within kelp populations is an important determinant of the importance of local reproduction to zoospore supply due to the effects of flow modification by kelp canopies on zoospore dispersal.

AB Rhizobial bacteria, endomycorrhizal fungi (also known as arbuscular mycorrhizas), and pseudomonad bacteria associated with plant roots can provide substantial benefits to the plants by fixing nitrogen, supplying phosphorus, or controlling root pathogens, respectively. A significant fraction of plant photosynthetic carbon may be used by these associated microorganisms, both to support their beneficial activities and for microbial growth and reproduction. Because many microbial individuals are associated with each individual plant, the individual benefit to a microbe that allocates more resources to its own reproduction (thereby allocating less to fixing N-2, supplying P, or producing antifungal metabolites) would exceed its individual loss from any resulting reduction in collective benefits (mainly plant carbon substrates). An initially rare "free rider" mutant strain might therefore be expected to displace its more cooperative parental strain. Yet, the mycorrhizal and legume-rhizobium mutualisms have persisted (often coexisting with "cheating") for millions of years. This paper discusses the importance of microbial cooperation (with plants and with other microbes) and possible reasons for its evolutionary persistence in the rhizosphere. In undisturbed soils, spatial structure can favor kin selection, but this may be counterbalanced by the increased likelihood that future competitors will be among the beneficiaries of current cooperation. In loose associations, direct fitness benefits to microorganisms may explain the evolutionary persistence of activities (e.g., production of antifungal compounds) that can benefit plants as a side effect. In closer, more symbiotic, relationships, host sanctions against individuals or clones that fail to perform their symbiotic function may be more important. New molecular methods and other research tools are facilitating research on this topic, and some of these conclusions soon may be revised.

AB The temporal patterns of soil water potential in a stand of Artemisia tridentata in central Utah, USA, were monitored during the summer, which included small periodic rainfall events, and over the winter, when most of the soil recharge occurs in this environment. The pattern of recharge, when compared to an area cleared of above ground vegetation, strongly indicated that the downward movement of water to 1.5 in was primarily conducted via roots by the process known as hydraulic redistribution. Rainwater was moved rapidly downward shortly after the rain event and continued over a period of a few days. For rainwater reaching a 0.3-1.5 in depth, the portion redistributed by roots was estimated to range from 100% for small rainfall events (<8 mm) to 74% for a 36-mm event. Simulations with a model of soil water movement that compared situations with and without hydraulic redistribution by roots, indicated that during the fall-spring recharge period, 67% of all water moved downward below 0.1 in was via roots, while 87% of the water moved below 0.3 in was via roots. These results indicate that rapid downward movement of rainwater by roots can be a significant mechanism of soil water recharge to depth in and and semiarid ecosystems.

AB Both the ordination of taxonomic tables and the measurements of species diversity aim to capture the prominent features of the species composition of a community. However, interrelations between ordination techniques and diversity measurements are seldom explicated and are mainly ignored by many field ecologists. This paper starts from the notion of the species occurrence table, which provides a unifying formulation for different kinds of taxonomic data, Here it is demonstrated that alternative species weightings can be used to equate the total inertia of a centered-by-species occurrence table with common diversity indices, such as species richness, Simpson diversity, or Shannon information. Such an equation defines two main ordination strategies related to two different but consistent measures of species diversity. The first places emphasis on scarce species and is based on Correspondence Analysis and species richness (CA-richness strategy). The second, in which abundant species are prominent, relies on Non-Symmetric Correspondence Analysis and Simpson diversity (NSCA-Simpson strategy). Both strategies are suitable for measuring alpha and beta diversity by analyzing the centered-by-species, occurrence table with respect to external environmental or instrumental variables.
   In this paper, these two strategies are applied to ecological data obtained in a Neotropical rainforest plot. The results are then discussed with respect to the intrinsic characteristics of the community under analysis, and also to the broad classes of floro-faunistic data used in ecology (i.e., data gathered from museum or herbarium collections, exhaustive inventories in a reference plot, or enumeration through species-by-releves tables), The approach encompasses several well-known techniques such as Correspondence Analysis, Non-Symmetric Correspondence Analysis, Canonical Correspondence Analysis. and Redundancy Analysis, and provides greater insight into interrelations between ordination methods and diversity studies.

AB Current theoretical models and field evidence suggest that facilitation and interference act simultaneously in the field, but there is little information on their joint dynamics under varying abiotic conditions. We evaluated spatial and temporal variations in the positive, negative, and net effects of the tussock grass Stipa tenacissima on the shrub Pistacia lentiscus in Mediterranean semiarid grasslands. We performed a field experiment in which positive (microclimatic amelioration and water inputs from runoff). and negative (belowground competition) effects were experimentally manipulated under contrasting levels of stress. The environment provided by S. tenacissima (tussock treatment) improved the survival and physiological status of planted P. lentiscus seedlings. The elimination of shade and competition from S. tenacissima significantly decreased and increased, respectively, seedling performance as compared to the tussock treatment. We found evidence that microclimatic amelioration is the main positive factor involved in the interaction under study, and that it can balance the negative effects of belowground competition. The latter was also important, especially after major rainfall events. In contrast with previous studies, both the water inputs from runoff and the soil chemical fertility were found to have a relatively weak effect in the interaction under study. The net effect of S. tenacissima on P. lentiscus was always facilitative, but the magnitude of this effect increased with the harshness of the environmental conditions in both space and time. Despite this, the mechanisms underlying plant-plant interaction responded unequally to small-scale environmental variation. Our results agree with models suggesting that the magnitude of facilitation may increase under stressful conditions, and provide evidence of the dynamic nature of positive and negative interactions in the field.

AB Understanding how terrestrial ecosystems function requires a combined aboveground-belowground approach, because of the importance of feedbacks that occur between herbivores, producers, and the decomposer subsystem. In this paper, we identify several mechanisms by which herbivores can indirectly affect decomposer organisms and soil processes through altering the quantity and quality of resources entering the soil. We show that these mechanisms are broadly similar in nature for both foliar and root herbivory, regardless of whether they operate in the short term as a result of physiological responses of individual plants to herbivore attack or long-term following alteration of plant community structure, by herbivores and subsequent changes in the quality of litter inputs to soil. We propose that a variety of possible mechanisms is responsible for the idiosyncratic nature of herbivore effects on soil biota and ecosystem function; positive, negative, or neutral effects of herbivory are possible depending upon the balance of these different mechanisms. However, we predict that positive effects of herbivory on soil biota and soil processes are most common in ecosystems of high soil fertility and high consumption rates, whereas negative effects are most common in unproductive ecosystems with low consumption rates. The significance of multiple-species herbivore communities is also emphasized, and we propose that if resource use complementarity among herbivore species or functional groups leads to greater total consumption of phytomass, and thus greater net herbivory, then both positive and negative consequences of increasing herbivore diversity for belowground properties and processes are theoretically possible. Research priorities are highlighted and include a need for comparative studies of herbivore impacts on above- and belowground processes across ecosystems of varying productivity, as well as a heed for experimental testing of the influence of antiherbivore defense compounds on complex multitrophic interactions in the rhizosphere and the significance of multiple herbivore species communities on these plant-soil interactions.

AB Studies in terrestrial systems suggest that long-distance propagule dispersal is. important for landscape pattern and dynamics, but largely inconsequential for local demography. By contrast, in marine systems, dispersal at regional scales may drive local dynamics, because many species may have large mean dispersal distances. To assess variation in marine dispersal scales, we estimated mean dispersal distances from genetic isolation-by-distance slopes. Estimates ranged widely, from a few meters to hundreds of kilometers. Dispersal differed among taxonomic groups (macroalgae, invertebrates, and fish) and among species in different functional groups (e.g., producers and herbivores). Differences in dispersal scale have important implications for marine community dynamics, reserve design, responses to large-scale perturbations, and evolution of interacting species.
   To place genetic estimates of marine dispersal in context, we compared them to other measures of dispersal in the ocean and to estimates of dispersal on land. Maximum scales of dispersal by sedentary marine species exceeded maximum estimates of terrestrial plant dispersal by at least one to two orders of magnitude. Direct and genetic estimates of terrestrial plant dispersal were comparable to estimates of marine plant dispersal. Rates of marine macroalgal range expansion, however, far exceeded spread rates of terrestrial plants. Terrestrial plant spread rates were more similar to those of short-dispersing marine organisms that lack secondary dispersal by drifting adults. Genetic estimates of dispersal by different functional groups suggest that herbivores typically disperse much farther than their plant resources both on land and in the sea, although the timing, frequency, and consequences of dispersal may differ in the two systems. Terrestrial herbivores have more flexible dispersal behavior than marine organisms that disperse each generation by planktonic transport of larvae.
   Our results validate some long-standing views about the greater dispersal potential of species in the ocean, but also highlight the extreme heterogeneity in dispersal scale among marine species. As a result, development of a community perspective on marine connectivity will require consideration of multiple dispersal mechanisms and scales.

AB We demonstrate the use of piecewise regression as a statistical technique to model ecological thresholds. Recommended procedures for analysis are illustrated with a case study examining the width of edge effects in two understory plant communities. Piecewise regression models are "broken-stick" models, where two or more lines are joined at unknown points, called "breakpoints." Breakpoints can be used as-estimates of thresholds and are used here to determine the width of edge effects. We compare a sharp-transition model with three models incorporating smooth transitions: the hyperbolic-tangent, benthyperbola, and bent-cable models. We also calculate three types of confidence intervals for the breakpoint estimate: an interval based on the computed standard error of the estimate from the fitting procedure, an empirical bootstrap confidence interval, and a confidence interval derived from an inverted F test. We recommend use of the inverted F test confidence interval when sample sizes are large, and cautious use of bootstrapped confidence intervals when sample sizes are smaller. Our analysis demonstrates the need for a careful study of the likelihood surface when fitting and interpreting the results from piecewise-regression models.

AB We studied the reproductive strategy of a population of fat dormice (Myoxus glis) breeding in nest boxes in a beech forest on the southern Alps, Italy. In eight years of data collection (1991-1998), we observed births only in 1991, 1992, and 1995. We did not observe young during the autumn dispersal in the remaining five years. Reproduction was not correlated with high rainfall, low temperature in summer, or with population density. Reproduction was only observed in years of beech mast seeding. Body condition of adults when they emerged from hibernation did not differ between years with and without reproduction, suggesting that the adults may avoid breeding when the young have a low probability of surviving their first winter. A capture-recapture analysis on individually marked adult fat dormice identified a very high yearly survival rate (0.86-0.92), close to that of large herbivorous mammals and much higher than that typical of other rodent species with similar body size. No influence of sex on survival or recapture probability was detected. The long life span expectancy of an adult dormouse (averaging nine years) is the prerequisite for the infrequent breeding strategy adopted by this rodent species to cope with an unpredictable food source. A high survival rate despite the small body size may have been possible because of the long hibernation time (>6 months). Long life span and intermittent breeding make the life history of fat dormice unique among rodents.

AB Transfer of energy from more productive donor habitats is frequently significant for the maintenance of consumers in the recipient habitats. Nevertheless, the connection between the distribution of consumers and allochthonous inputs has not been directly examined by field experiment. We present experimental evidence that terrestrial invertebrate inputs directly influence the distribution of stream fishes in a forested headwater stream. When terrestrial invertebrate input to the stream was experimentally reduced by using greenhouse covers, fish biomass also decreased dramatically. Despite the greater amounts of input in the control than in the reduced treatments, terrestrial invertebrates made up similar to90% of stomach contents in both treatments during the study period. Moreover, no difference in fish growth rates was evident between the treatments. These results provide experimental evidence that the flow of such allochthonous resources in the donor-controlled system can explain the distribution and dynamics of the consumer populations.

AB Animals that obtain food by using the investment of other foragers (kleptoparasites) often do so in groups. We tested whether group formation by a kleptoparasitic fish, the western buffalo bream (Kyphosus cornelii), fit the predictions of five social foraging models. Two aggregation economy models assumed that there was some benefit to grouping shared by group members, such as reduced predation risk or increased ability to gain access to resources. These models and a third, the dispersion (ideal free) economy model, assumed that kleptoparasites had perfect information regarding the quality of opportunities for kleptoparasitism. The other two models did not make this assumption. These producer-scrounger models assumed that some kleptoparasites (producers) discovered opportunities, while others used producers to reduce the costs of foraging. These last two models differed in whether foragers could estimate the state of current opportunities for kleptoparasitism. We compared typical group size, and the influence of group size on intake rate and the success of kleptoparasitic attempts, with the predictions of these models. We found that typical group size was larger during periods. when opportunities for kleptoparasitism were poor than when good and that there was no influence of group size on the likelihood that the group was successful at kleptoparasitizing. Individual intake rate declined with group size for small group sizes, but increased with group size in large groups. However, large groups were rare. For small groups, only a producer-scrounger model allowing foragers to update their information could not be rejected. For large groups, neither that model nor the aggregation economy with foraging benefits model could be rejected. We compare these results with those of other studies of kleptoparasitic groups.

AB Spatial mosaics in resource productivity may facilitate competitive coexistence when species differ in their ability to exploit resource-rich vs. resource-poor conditions. In this study, I investigated. the influence of a termite-generated spatial mosaic in resource productivity on the dynamics of competition and coexistence in a guild of four acacia ants that reside on Acacia drepanolobium. Near termite mounds, both new shoot production of A. drepanolobium and densities of litter-dwelling invertebrates (an important food source of the acacia ants) are higher than in "matrix" habitats, between mounds. This resource variation is spatially correlated with the outcome of competition among acacia ants for host trees; near the mounds, competitively dominant species are more likely to supplant subordinates, whereas the likelihood of subordinates replacing dominants on host trees increases with distance from mounds.. Variation in competitive outcomes among patch types appears to result from differential responses among acacia ant species to resource heterogeneity. Analysis of average tissue delta(15)N levels indicated that acacia ant colonies near termite mounds had higher ratios of animal prey in their diets than colonies in matrix areas. Bait trials and analysis of average nest size in mound and matrix habitats suggest that competitively dominant species are disproportionately successful in exploiting higher prey densities near termite mounds. Increased dietary uptake of nitrogen-rich prey may fuel more rapid colony growth in competitively dominant acacia ants, resulting in more pronounced asymmetries in colony size between dominant and subordinate species in mound areas. Because colony size asymmetry is a key determinant of interspecific competitive outcomes, colonies of subordinate species near termite mounds may be more vulnerable to aggressive take-overs by dominants. In lower-productivity matrix habitats, increased tolerance to low-resource conditions may afford subordinate species greater persistence. Overall, these results suggest that termite-induced habitat heterogeneity plays a significant role in the dynamics of the acacia ant community, and may contribute to species coexistence in this intensely competitive community.

AB Artificial selection has been practiced by humans since the dawn of agriculture, but only recently have evolutionary ecologists. turned to this tool to understand nature. To perform artificial selection, the phenotypic trait of interest is measured on a population, and the individuals with the most extreme phenotypic values are bred to produce the next generation. The change in the mean of the selected trait across each generation is the response to selection, and other traits can also evolve due to genetic correlations with the selected trait. Artificial selection can directly answer the question of how quickly a trait will evolve under a given strength of selection. This kind of result can help ecologists determine whether range or niche boundaries are determined by a lack of variation for a key phenotypic trait or trade-offs due to genetic correlations with other fitness-related traits. In a related approach, controlled natural selection, the organisms are not selected according to their values for a given trait, but rather are allowed to evolve for one to several generations under experimentally imposed environmental treatments such as temperature, light, nutrients, presence or absence of predators or competitors, etc. The results of this kind of study can tell us how quickly a population can adapt to a given environmental change, either natural or anthropogenic. Finally, artificial selection can create more variation for measurements of natural Selection or can be coupled with QTL mapping; both these combinations provide new. insights into adaptation. I discuss advantages and disadvantages of these approaches relative to other kinds of studies and highlight case studies showing how these tools can answer a,wide range of basic and applied questions in ecology, ranging from niche and range boundaries and character displacement to climate change and invasive species.

AB We analyzed the importance of shoot structural and leaf physiological characteristics in determining interspecific differences in whole-shoot carbon gain in a tallgrass meadow. Canopy structure, aboveground mass, leaf nitrogen content, and leaf photosynthesis were determined for individual shoots of the dominant grass Miscanthus sinensis (a C. species) and for four forb species (all C-3). These data were used to calculate net daily carbon gain of individual shoots in absolute terms, per unit leaf area, and per unit aboveground biomass (P-mass). P-mass in turn, is an important component of growth per unit mass (relative growth rate, RGR). Miscanthus shoots had a higher total carbon gain and a higher P-mass than shoots of the other species. The greater P-mass of Miscanthus shoots was not because they captured more light per unit mass (Phi(mass)), but because they achieved higher rates of photosynthesis per unit of absorbed light (P-light, P-mass = Phi(mass) x P-light). The latter was mainly due to the higher leaf photosynthetic capacities per unit nitrogen associated with the C, pathway of this species. Among the forbs, Potentilla freyniana had the highest P-mass, even though it was the shortest, most shaded species in the stand. This high P was because its shoots had relatively high leaf-area-to-mass ratios (resulting in high and low rates of dark respiration (resulting in high P-light). Sensitivity analysis of our model showed that relative to the other species these traits enable Potentilla to achieve high carbon gain in the shade but not at high light. It also showed that the traits of Miscanthus enable it to achieve relatively high carbon gain at high light but not at low light. Another sensitivity analysis revealed that an increase in leaf area and associated light capture of shoots, while keeping their total canopy nitrogen constant and thus reducing their leaf N content and associated photosynthetic capacities, reduced the estimated carbon gain for most of the shoots in the stand. These results indicate that interspecific differences in carbon gain per unit mass in this stand were more closely associated with differences in leaf physiology than with structural differences that determine light capture.

AB Elucidating the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up forces in communities of phytophagus insects has been a major historical focus. Current consensus is that both forces play a role, but it is poorly known if these forces act differently on herbivores in the same assemblage and what factors underlie this variation. Using manipulative experiments with an assemblage of sap-feeding phytophagous insects (six species of plant-hoppers, leafhoppers, and heteropteran bugs) inhabiting intertidal Spartina marshes, we examined the association between herbivore behavior, risk of predation, and ultimately the relative impact of top-down (wolf spider predation) and bottom-up (host-plant nutrition) factors on the population density of each sap-feeding herbivore.
   A factorial experiment on open Spartina islets in the field (two levels of plant nutrition crossed with two levels of spider predation) showed that bottom-up and top-down manipulations differentially affected the various sap-feeders. Overall, bottom-up effects dominated in this sap-feeder community, whereby the density of all six sap-feeders increased when the nitrogen content of Spartina was elevated. By contrast, wolf-spider addition significantly suppressed populations of only the Prokelisia species and had little impact on the other four sap-feeder species in the community. Functional-response experiments and behavioral studies revealed that certain species (Prokelisia planthoppers) were at much higher risk of attack by wolf spiders than other sap-feeders in the assemblage and that risk of predation was associated with a species' particular "escape/defensive behavior." Moreover, risk of spider predation was roughly linked to the strength of top-down impacts in the field, because species with ineffective escape behaviors and a high risk of spider attack (Prokelisia planthoppers) were the only sap-feeders whose populations were suppressed by spider predation in the field. Thus, specific behavioral characteristics of the sap-feeders on Spartina influenced risk of predation and the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up impacts on their population dynamics.
   Notably, all herbivores in this system were positively influenced by elevated plant nutrition, only the common sap-feeder species (Prokelisia planthoppers) were adversely affected by spider predation, and it was the rarer sap-feeders in the assemblage that were least impacted by predation. These results call into question the overall pervasiveness of top-down forces and underscore the primacy of basal resources in structuring this community of phytophagous insects.

AB Population regulation requires between-generation temporal density dependence, which has proved difficult to document unequivocally in nature, especially in marine fishes. Field experiments and observations in the Bahamas demonstrated that such population regulation occurs in the coral-reef fish Gramma loreto. I performed manipulative field experiments that identified mortality as the primary source of demographic density dependence among local populations. The causative mechanism involved a response in the behavior of predators, which both aggregated and spent more time hunting where prey fish densities were high. Spatially density-dependent mortality (i.e., density dependence among populations) led to between-generation temporal density dependence (i.e., density dependence within populations over time) indicative of population regulation. Over three years-roughly two generations-local populations followed regular annual cycles of abundance that stemmed from seasonal patterns of recruitment. Despite considerable natural and experimentally induced variability in the recruitment of new individuals, adult density remained nearly constant. Because multispecies interactions such as predation can be necessary to regulate marine populations, effective management and conservation requires an ecosystem approach that preserves these interactions.

AB Native pine-forest streams from Maine and North Carolina, USA. and exotic pine-forest streams from New Zealand were compared to assess the effects of geographic location on three aspect,., of community structure: (1) taxonomic composition, (2) trophic structure (summarized in terms of functional feeding groups), and (3) food web structure (as connectivity food webs). In addition. pine-forest assemblages in New Zealand were compared to assemblages from New Zealand native forest and grassland streams. Taxonomic similarity was, as expected. low for invertebrates. but there were strong similarities in the algal assemblages in different geographic locations. Trophic structure analysis was unable to distinguish either geographic or land-use effects. Food web analysis revealed structural similarities between the pine-forest streams. regardless of location, but there were clear differences among land uses in New Zealand. Pine-forest streams were typified by food webs with few algal species. low internal connectance and a relatively square shape. Grassland food webs were more triangular in shape and exhibited high internal connectance. while native forest food webs had intermediate characteristics. The results show that the native stream biota. despite a distinct species composition. can adapt to a novel riparian vegetation type and produce trophic and food web structures that are difficult to distinguish from those in the country of origin.

AB The rates of transmission of infection from inoculum or infecteds to susceptible hosts are critical determinants of epidemics, yet no formal experimental methods have been described for their quantification and analysis in spatially explicit epidemics. Replicated microcosms of >400 radish seedlings and with tight control of environmental conditions were exposed to known amounts of inoculum of the fungal plant pathogen Rhizoctonia solani. Spatiotemporal maps of disease progress were used to distinguish between primary and secondary infections and to count changes with time in the number of infected plants and the number of contacts between susceptible and neighboring infected plants. Transmission rates were defined within a compartmental S-I (susceptible-infected) model for plant epidemics and estimated empirically using counts from spatial maps. The transmission rate for primary infection declined with time; the transmission rate for secondary infection rose initially and then declined. We discuss the mechanisms contributing to the changes in transmission rates with time and show that spatial mapping combined with an epidemiological analysis provides accurate empirical estimates of transmission rates.

AB A century of annual burning of the understory of otherwise fire-free deciduous tropical forest in central India has favored seven tree species that produce sprouts or suckers from root buds (root-sprouters) over 37 species that produce sprouts basally from root crowns (root-crown resprouters). Experiments over two years demonstrated that low-intensity ground fires killed seedlings (<1 year old), resulting in a 30% decrease in seedling diversity in burned relative to unburned plots. Overall fire-related mortality of seedlings was 74% for 17 root-crown resprouters, compared, to 63% for six root-sprouters. Repeated-measures ANOVA showed that the number of juvenile (>1 year old) stems of root-sprouters increased in burned study plots but decreased in plots protected from fire. Annual burning by people favors species that repair damage by root sprouts. Root-sprouting offers a means of occupying new ground with clonal ramets away from the original parental base. Over time, forests may become dominated by clonal root-sprouters, in contrast to historical accounts of forest dominated by root-crown resprouters that do not spread by clonal growth. If this process continues in the Mendha Forest in India, >80% of its tree diversity could be lost within 100-200 years.

AB The number of species in an area is critical to the development of evolutionary and ecological theory from mass extinctions to island biogeography. Still, the factors influencing the accuracy of estimators of species richness are poorly understood. We explored these factors by simulating landscapes, that varied in species richness, relative abundances, and the spatial distribution. We compared the extrapolations of nine nonparametric estimators and two species accumulation curves under three sampling intensities. Community evenness of species' abundances, sampling intensity, and the level of true species richness significantly influenced bias, precision, and accuracy of the estimations. Perhaps most surprisingly, the effects of gradient strength and spatial autocorrelation type were generally insignificant. The nonparametric estimators were substantially less biased and more precise than the species accumulation curves. Observed species richness was most biased. Community evenness, sampling intensity, and the level of true species richness influenced the performance of the nonparametric estimators indirectly via the fraction of all species found in a sample or "sample coverage." For each particular level of sample coverage, a single estimator was most accurate. Choice of estimator is confounded by a priori uncertainty about the sample coverage. Accordingly, researchers can extrapolate species richness by various estimators and base the estimator choice on the mean estimated sample coverage. Alternatively, the most reliable estimator with respect to community evenness can be chosen. These predictions from our simulations are confirmed in two field studies.

AB Compensatory growth (CG, accelerated growth that may occur when an organism that has grown at a reduced rate as a result of suboptimal environmental conditions is exposed to better conditions) is considered an adaptation to variable environments. Although documented thoroughly under captive conditions, CG has rarely been studied in wild populations. In their first years of life, oceanic-stage loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) have relatively little control over their geographic position or movements and thus have an extremely stochastic lifestyle with great variation in food availability and temperature. This environmental variation results in variable growth rates. We evaluate somatic growth functions of oceanic-stage loggerheads from the eastern Atlantic based on skeletochronology that allowed us to assign age and cohort to each individual. We demonstrate CG in these turtles based on three different analytical approaches: changes in coefficients of variation in size-at-age, generalized additive model regression analyses of somatic growth, and linear regression of age-specific growth rates. As a result of CG, variation in size-at-age in these juvenile loggerheads is substantially reduced. Thus, size is a better predictor of age than expected based on variation in growth rates. CG decreases with age, apparently as loggerheads gain greater control over their movements. In addition, we have evaluated for the first time in wild sea turtles the time-dependent nature of somatic growth by distinguishing among age, year, and cohort effects using a mixed longitudinal sampling design with assigned-age individuals. Age and year had significant effects on growth rates, but there was no significant cohort effect. Our results address critical gaps in knowledge of the demography of this endangered species.

AB Why do closely related, coexisting species typically differ in phenotypic features associated with resource use?. One answer to this question is that such differences might generally evolve in allopatry, as different species adapt to divergent environmental conditions, and any differences that thereby accumulate might subsequently enable coexistence in sympatry. Alternatively, coexisting species might generally diverge in sympatry, because of selection to reduce competition for food (character displacement). Here we evaluated these two causes of character divergence by asking which hypothesis better explains differences in feeding morphology between tadpoles of two species of spadefoot toads, Spea bombifrons and S. multiplicata. We found that, in natural ponds containing both species, S. multiplicata almost always developed into a smaller, round-bodied tadpole with normal sized jaw muscles used for feeding on detritus at the pond bottom (the "omnivore" morph), whereas S. bombifrons almost always developed into a larger, flat-headed tadpole with greatly enlarged jaw muscles used for feeding on crustaceans in open water (the "carnivore" morph). By contrast, in all but one of 18 similar ponds containing a single species, both species expressed both phenotypes. Divergence between species in morph production appears to have evolved in sympatry: when we compared population means for each of four key trophic characters, we found that no allopatric population of S. bombifrons was as carnivore-like as the sympatric S. bombifrons, and, for three of four characters, no allopatric population of S. multiplicata was as omnivore-like as the sympatric S. multiplicata. In contrast to significant differences in trophic characters, we found no divergence between allopatric and sympatric populations in a character not directly involved in feeding on detritus or crustaceans (overall body size). These data, together with our earlier experimental work, reveal that coexisting S. bombifrons and S. multiplicata have diverged from one another in resource use and in phenotypic features associated with resource use because of selection to reduce competition for food (i.e., character displacement). Spea tadpoles, therefore, are one of few systems for which both experimental and observational evidence link phenotypic divergence to resource competition, thereby providing a model for understanding why coexisting species often differ phenotypically.

AB Root exclusion experiments demonstrated the importance of belowground competition between grasses and Prosopis glandulosa (honey mesquite) during the critical seeding establishment phase of the woody plant life cycle. Belowground available volume accounted for 67% and 79% of the variance in first- and second-year Prosopis seedling growth and survival, respectively. Available volume in the vertical dimension was more important than that in the horizontal dimension. Trials spanned years with contrasting annual precipitation, suggesting that root competition occurs in years of near-average as well as below-average annual rainfall. Spatial heterogeneity in canopy gaps and belowground biomass was also quantified in a Schizachayriuim-Paspalum grassland matrix and evaluated with respect to Prosopis seedling establishment. Of the 100 grid points encountered in four grass stands, 62% were unoccupied; and 50% of these exceeded 80 cm(2) (similar to10 cm diameter). Gaps greater than or equal to 10 cm in diameter were sufficient for successful Prosopis germination and survival after one (40%) and two (15%) growing seasons. Herbaceous root biomass was statistically comparable among stands, but point-specific biomass varied three orders of magnitude (<50 g/m(2) to >3000 g/m(2)). In addition, root biomass was temporally variable, ranging from a mean (+/-1 SE; g/m(2)) of 768 (86) in a year of below-average annual rainfall (1996; 721 mm) to 1108 (104) in a year of roughly average annual rainfall (1995; 1032 rum). It is often assumed that grasslands dominated by productive, late seral species will be resistant to woody plant encroachment; and that grazing, by reducing the ability of grasses to competitively exclude woody seedlings, makes grasslands susceptible to tree/shrub invasion. However, given the substantial annual variation in belowground biomass observed in this study, it seems reasonable that ungrazed grasslands may be more susceptible to woody plant encroachment in some years and more resistant in others. Furthermore, given the substantial spatial variation in aboveground gap area and belowground biomass, there may be numerous low-competition microsites for woody plant seedlings within ungrazed grasslands. A high degree of temporal and spatial variability in gap area and belowground biomass may therefore help explain successful establishment of woody seedlings in ungrazed or lightly grazed, late seral grasslands in the absence of fire. We found no correlation between aboveground structure and belowground biomass at scales of 1-10 m(2). Thus, readily quantifiable attributes such as grass basal area or gap area could not be used to infer site susceptibility to woody plant seedling establishment.

AB Historically, fish predation has been viewed as a primary determinant of zooplankton community size structure and variable dominance by large-bodied Daphnia species. However, recent models have emphasized the relative carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus content of algae as a potential determinant of these patterns. In this research, I utilized five fishless ponds that varied in Daphnia pulex relative abundance and patterns of seasonal succession to explore the factors influencing Daphnia population performance in these systems. D. pulex population growth rates were measured in three treatments: (1) predators/competitors excluded, (2) competitors present and predators excluded, and (3) competitors and the predator Chaoborus present. The experiment was conducted twice in the growing season. In contrast to the top-down view, effects of competition outweighed effects of predation but were variable among ponds (being strongest in those ponds/times in which Daphnia relative abundance was low, and weakest when Daphnia were dominant). Competitor interaction strength was also temporally variable, increasing later in the season. Several potential determinants (biotic and abiotic) of variable competition intensity were explored using regressions. Only the C:P ratio of edible algae showed a significant relationship; negative effects of competition increased as algae became more phosphorus limited, in keeping with recent stoichiometric models. However, significant collinearities in several biotic/abiotic variables among ponds suggest, that this interpretation may not be the only explanation for variable competition intensity.

AB In native tallgrass prairie, soil depth and nitrogen (N) availability strongly influence aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and plant species composition. We manipulated these factors in a newly restored grassland to determine if these resources similarly constrain productivity and diversity during the initial three years of grassland establishment. Four types of experimental plots with six treatment combinations of deep and shallow soil at reduced-, ambient-, and enriched-N availability formed the basis of this study. The soil responses to the experimental treatments were examined over three years, and patterns in diversity and productivity were examined in year 3. The soil depth treatment did not significantly affect soil carbon (C) and N pools or ANPP and diversity. A pulse amendment of C added to the soil prior to planting increased soil microbial biomass and decreased potential net N mineralization rates to effectively reduce N availability throughout the study. Nitrogen availability declined over time in nonamended soils as a result of plant establishment, but adding fertilizer N alleviated the increasing immobilization potential of the soil. The level of ANPP was lowest and diversity highest in the reduced-N treatment, whereas the enriched-N treatment resulted in high productivity, but low diversity. As a result, diversity was inversely correlated with productivity in these newly established communities. The same mechanism invoked to explain decreased diversity under nutrient enrichment in old-field ecosystems and native grasslands (e.g., reduced light availability with increased production) was supported in the restored prairie by the positive relationship between ANPP and intercepted light, and a strong correlation between light availability and diversity. The effects of nutrient availability on plant community composition (diversity and richness) were due primarily to the responses of prairie species, as the productivity of early successional, nonprairie species was less than 1% of total ANPP after three years of establishment. These results show that the effects of resource availability on productivity and diversity are similar in young and mature grasslands, and that manipulation of a limiting nutrient during grassland establishment can influence floristic composition, with consequences for long-term patterns of diversity in restored ecosystems.

AB Feedback between plants, and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can affect species diversity in plant and fungal communities. Feedback depends on (1) some specificity between plants and fungi and (2) fungi exhibiting specificity either improving (positive feedback) or decreasing. (negative feedback) host performance relative to other fungi. Associations between AM fungi and plant - species in a serpentine grassland dominated by Andropogon gerardii,Schizachyrium scoparium, Sorghastrum nutans, and Sporobolus heterolepis were examined, and their performance consequences were evaluated. Specificity was determined from AM fungal spore abundance under plants in the field and from trap cultures established by inoculating greenhouse plants with field-collected roots containing fungal material. Seven AM fungal species were unevenly distributed among plant species, with differences in total spore numbers and evenness. In the field, Gigaspora gigantea exhibited specificity to Sporobolus compared to Andropogon and Sorghastrum, and Glomus microcarpum exhibited specificity to Schizachyrium compared to Andropogon and Sporobolus. In trap cultures, Glomus etunicatum exhibited specificity to Andropogon compared to Sorghastrum, and an unidentified species of Glomus exhibited specificity to Sorghastrum compared to Sporobolus. The AM fungal community associated with Smilax rotundifolia, a grassland invader, was not qualitatively different from those of grasses.
   In the greenhouse, plant and fungal performance was examined as a function of three host plant species (excluding Sporobolus), four AM fungal species, and the same three plant species on which the fungi had been collected in the field. Fungal species affected. host plant biomass and fungal performance, measured by AM root length and percentage of colonization. Compared to other fungal species,, Gigaspora gigantea increased plant biomass And had a higher percentage of colonization and AM root length on both Andropogon and Schizachyrium. Glomus etunicatum, which exhibits specificity on Andropogon, depressed growth of Andropogon relative to other fungi, implicating negative feedback. Schizachyrium had reduced biomass when inoculated with Glomus microcarpum, its specific fungus. Additionally, fungi originating on a conspecific host depressed plant growth compared to fungi collected from other host species, an effect strongest for Andropogon. Percentage of AM colonization on Andropogon was also greater for fungi originating on Andropogon. The latter two effects serve as another example of negative plant-fungal feedback and could represent intraspecific fungal variation within this community.

AB How animals change their movement patterns in relation to the environment is a central topic in a wide area of ecology, including foraging ecology, habitat selection, and spatial population ecology. To understand the underlying behavioral mechanisms involved, there is a need for methods to measure changes in movement patterns along a pathway through the landscape. We used simulated pathways and satellite tracking of a long-ranging seabird to explore the properties of first-passage time as a measure of search effort along a path. The first-passage time is defined as the time required for an animal to cross a circle with a given radius. It is a measure of how much time an animal uses within a given area. First-passage time is scale dependent, and a plot of variance in first-passage time vs. spatial scale reveals the spatial scale at which the animal concentrates its search effort. By averaging the first-passage time on a geographical grid, it is possible to relate first-passage time to environmental variables and the search pattern of other individuals.

AB Spatially synchronous dynamics are widespread in ecology, but attributing them. to environmental correlation, as originally pro-posed by Moran, is complicated by the synchronizing influences of dispersal and trophic interactions. Nonetheless, spatially correlated masting in trees and its relation to spatial covariation in weather patterns over large regions are strongly suggestive of coupling of populations by large-scale climate. I investigated the potential for population synchronization by large-scale climate in an analysis of long-term (i.e., 50-yr) dynamics of the timing of flowering by three species of plants in 26 populations spanning several hundred kilometers in,Norway. Temporal fluctuations in the timing of flowering were highly correlated across populations, both within and among species. Moreover, large-scale climatic fluctuation (the Arctic Oscillation) synchronized the timing of flowering across all three species over distances up to 500 kin. These results represent a clear demonstration of population linkage by large-scale climate, and suggest that populations of multiple species may be influenced simultaneously over broad distances by climatic change.

AB The strategy of relying extensively on stored nutrient reserves for reproduction (capital breeding) was thought to be common in large-bodied birds breeding in harsh environments, such as arctic-nesting geese, but this view has been challenged recently. Our objective was to model inputs to the eggs from stored reserves and from local food plants in Greater Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens atlantica) breeding in the high Arctic, using a now approach based on stable-isotope signatures. Snow Geese and their eggs were collected during laying from 1999 to 2001 (N = 66 females and 110 eggs). We analyzed the isotopic signature (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) of egg constituents (lipid-free yolk, yolk lipid, and albumen), goose tissues (lipid-free breast muscles, abdominal fat, and whole liver) and of the food plants eaten by laying geese in the Arctic (graminoids and forbs). We applied a two-isotope mixing model approach to delineate nutrient input to eggs quantitatively. Differences in the isotopic signature of endogenous reserves and arctic food plants were relatively large (5.3-8.0parts per thousand for Deltadelta(13)C and 7.5parts per thousand for Deltadelta(15)N) because reserves were accumulated in southern staging areas where geese feed in farmlands and estuarine habitats. The percentage of egg nutrients derived from exogenous sources (food consumed in the Arctic) was higher than from endogenous (body) reserves and varied little among the three years. Isotopic signatures indicated that endogenous reserves contributed 33% of lipid-free yolk nutrients, 27% of albumen, and 20% of yolk lipid, on average. Isotopic signatures of egg constituents of individual females were more strongly related to those of liver than endogenous sources (breast muscles or abdominal fat), indicating that the endogenous isotopic signature was diluted by a dietary input in the liver. We also found evidence of seasonal variation in the use of endogenous reserves. Late-laying females apparently invested proportionally more endogenous reserves in their eggs than did early layers, but not those laying larger clutches. We conclude that Greater Snow Geese use a mixed capital/income breeding strategy. Our study shows that isotopic composition of tissues can be used to infer the contribution of exogenous vs. endogenous sources of nutrients for egg formation where inputs differ isotopically.

AB It is often claimed that we do not understand the forces driving the global diversity gradient. However, an extensive literature suggests that contemporary climate constrains terrestrial taxonomic richness over broad geographic extents. Here, we review the empirical literature to examine the nature and form of the relationship between climate and richness. Our goals were to document the support for the climatically based energy hypothesis, and within the constraints imposed by correlative analyses, to evaluate two versions of the hypothesis: the productivity and ambient energy hypotheses. Focusing on studies extending over 800 km, we found that measures of energy, water, or water-energy balance explain spatial variation in richness better than other climatic and non-climatic variables in 82 of 85 cases. Even when considered individually and in isolation, water/energy variables explain on average over 60% of the variation in the richness of a wide range of plant and animal groups. Further, water variables usually represent the strongest. predictors in the tropics, subtropics, and warm temperate zones, whereas energy variables (for animals) or water-energy variables (for plants) dominate in high latitudes. We conclude that the interaction between water and energy, either directly or indirectly (via plant productivity), provides a strong explanation for globally extensive plant and animal diversity gradients, but for animals there also is a latitudinal shift in the relative importance of ambient energy vs. water moving from the poles to the equator. Although contemporary climate is not the only factor influencing species richness and may not explain the diversity pattern for all taxonomic groups, it is clear that understanding water-energy dynamics is critical to future biodiversity research. Analyses that do not include water-energy variables are missing a key component for explaining broad-scale patterns of diversity.

AB In closed-canopy forests, plant morphology and physiology determine shade tolerance and potential growth and mortality rates; potential vital rates and ongoing gap dependence determine realized vital rates; and realized vital rates determine individual size distributions. This hypothesis was evaluated for the 73 most abundant canopy tree species from Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The percentage of recruits located in tree-fall gaps (P), sapling growth (G), and mortality (M) rates, and the coefficient of skewness of size distributions (g(1)) were determined from censuses of all individuals >10 mm dbh in a 50-ha plot, Seven qualitative, bivariate predictions relating g(1), G, M, P, and wood density (W) were evaluated. Six of the seven predictions were substantiated in pairwise analyses. A path analysis integrated all seven predictions and explained 51% of the interspecific variation in g,. Size distributions with many large individuals and a long tail of relatively rare, small individuals (g(1) < 0) characterized gap-dependent species with large fecundity, seed mortality, seedling mortality, G, M, and P. Size distributions with many small individuals and a long tail of relatively rare, large individuals (g(1) > 0) characterized shade-tolerant species with the opposite traits. The percentage of tropical tree species that require tree-fall gaps to regenerate has been estimated to range from <20% to >70% for old-growth forests. Our analyses suggest that there are not large numbers of functionally equivalent species at either extreme of the regeneration continuum. Rather, there are very few extremely shade-tolerant and extremely light-demanding species. Most species have intermediate light requirements and lifestyles.

AB We analyzed to what extent and by what mechanisms plants of the tropical understory palm Chamaedorea elegans are able to mitigate the negative effects of defoliation on performance (i.e., plant size, total growth, leaf lamina growth, and reproduction) and how this is related to light availability. For this purpose we developed a new approach that allowed us to quantify the performance of defoliated plants relative not only to the performance of undamaged plants, but also relative to the estimated performance of hypothetical defoliated plants that do not exhibit any. mechanisms of compensatory growth. The latter provides a way to quantify the adaptive value of compensation with reference to a hypothetical noncompensating alternative state. C. elegans plants were grown in a greenhouse at two light levels (5% and 16% of natural daylight) and subjected to five defoliation treatments (a control and four levels of defoliation). Defoliation was repeated every three months. Growth analysis revealed that defoliated plants allocated considerably more mass to the production of leaf laminas (f(lam)) than control plants, at the expense of allocation to other organs, particularly reproductive structures. Average growth rates per unit leaf area (NAR) and per unit plant mass (RGR), both measured on the basis of above-ground mass, increased with the level of defoliation at high light but not at low light. We estimated that the increases in f(lam) and NAR enabled C. elegans to compensate for part of the potential loss in performance caused by defoliation, even in cases where their RGR values were lower than those of control plants. Sensitivity analysis indicated that changes in NAR contributed more to this compensation than f(lam), but the importance of f(lam) increased with defoliation level and with decreasing light availability. The degree of compensation was higher in the high- than in the low-light treatment, suggesting that the possession of traits associated with compensatory growth. may be more important in sunny than in shaded environments. The degree of compensation differed depending on the measure of performance. Defoliated plants fully compensated for the potential reduction in lamina growth but compensated for <20% of estimated loss in reproductive output. Since survival of C. elegans plants appears to be. strongly associated with their total leaf area, the greater compensation for lamina growth is important in relation to population dynamics.

AB The effects of solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR), both mid-ultraviolet (UVB; 280-320 nm) and near-ultraviolet (UVA; 320-400 nm), on benthic algal and invertebrate communities were compared in three reaches of a British Columbia coastal stream that differed in the degree of shading by riparian canopy (a full canopy, a partial canopy, and no canopy). At each of the three sites benthic communities were exposed to three different radiation treatments: photosynthetically active radiation alone (PAR; 400-700 nm), PAR+UVA, and PAR+UVA+UVB. Relative to the site with no canopy, UVR was 88% and 66% lower, and PAR was 83% and 49% lower at sites with full and partial canopy, respectively. Late summer increases in UVR to the streambed caused by declines in water level and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were also lower at sites with high canopy.
   Sites with less canopy shading had greater algal accrual, decreased biomass of total invertebrates, mayflies, and stoneflies, and reduced invertebrate community diversity compared to the heavily shaded reach of the stream. UVR produced taxon-specific community responses that varied across sites and increased with increasing UVR as summer progressed. At the full canopy site UVR had no impact, and the final (day 91) biomass and diversity of invertebrates was highest, and algal biomass lowest. Higher UVA radiation under reduced canopies inhibited algal accrual but had little effect on algal-community composition. The biomass of several invertebrate taxa (e.g., Dicosmoecus spp., Limnephilidae) and community diversity were reduced by both UVA and UVB. Less sensitive taxa (e.g., Paraleptophlebia spp., Paraleptophlebidae) were inhibited only by the highest UVB levels in late summer when water transparency to UVR was greatest. Inhibition of grazers by UVR appeared to indirectly increase algal accrual, particularly at the partial canopy site.
   Our results indicate that riparian shading may moderate UVR effects on benthic communities, mainly through impacts on invertebrates with indirect effects on algae. By reducing UVR exposure of streambeds, riparian canopies may be important for ameliorating UVR effects on shallow lotic systems, especially during late-summer, low-flow periods when DOC concentrations are reduced.

AB Most studies that examine conflicting selection pressures hold resources and frisks constant, despite their ubiquitous fluctuation. Since little is known about the consequences of neglecting this variation, we examined the temporal response of male red-spotted newts, Notophthalmus viridescens, to conflicting female pheromones and damage-release alarm chemicals signaling predation. After a single exposure in both the laboratory and field, males were attracted to female odor and avoided conspecific alarm chemicals. Response to these combined cues depended on time After exposure, with males initially avoiding, and then being attracted to, the cue combination. This response shift was due to the resource and risk declining at different rates, and female odor accelerating male recovery from antipredator behavior. In the laboratory, males suppressed activity when exposed to alarm chemicals alone but increased their activity when female odor was added. Iterative exposures through the breeding season revealed that, as male mate search activity declined, male avoidance of alarm chemicals increased, but alarm chemical production appeared unchanged. Thawing dates differed between ponds of the same and different populations, which offset levels of mate search activity and consequently alarm chemical avoidance. As a result, simultaneous pond surveys made it appear as though there was geographic variation in reproductive and predator-avoidance behaviors. However, when thawing dates were aligned, the time courses of reproductive and predator-avoidance behaviors for the ponds coincided, demonstrating that observed site differences were predominantly due to different behavioral onsets, which would have gone overlooked had the larger temporal scale not been considered. These results indicate that temporal variation can be easily mistaken for geographic variation in behavior, increasing the. potential for data interpretation errors. These studies underscore the importance of considering temporal variation when examining conflicting selection pressures.

ID MODELS; MORTALITY; INFERENCE; CLIMATE; CYCLES; FOREST; SIZE
AB Estimates of uncertainty are the basis for inference of population risk. Uncertainty is estimated from models fitted to data that typically include a deterministic model (e.g., population growth) and stochastic elements, which should accommodate errors in sampling and any sources of variability that affect observations. Prediction from fitted models (of, say, demography) to new variables (say, population growth) requires propagation of these stochastic elements. Ecological models ignore most forms of variability, because they make statistical models complex, and they pose computational challenges. Variability associated with space, time, and among individuals that is not accommodated by demographic models can make parameter estimates and growth rate predictions unrealistic.
   I adapt a hierarchical approach to the problem of estimating population growth rates and their uncertainties when individuals vary and that variability cannot be assigned to specific causes. In contrast to an overfitted model that would assign a different parameter value to each individual, hierarchical models accommodate individual differences, but assume that those differences derive from an underlying distribution-they belong to a "population." The hierarchical model can be implemented in classical (frequentist) and Bayesian frameworks (I demonstrate both) and analyzed using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Results show that population growth models that rely on standard propagation of estimation error but ignore variability among individuals can misrepresent uncertainties in ways that erode credibility.

AB Resource polymorphisms, or morphological variations related to resource use, are common in fishes and are thought to be a possible step in speciation. This study experimentally tests the hypothesis that fitness (as estimated by growth rates) is increased by the presence of multiple trophic morphotypes (or morphs) within a population. Cage experiments were used to quantify the intraspecific competitive interactions between morphs of the polymorphic cichlid Herichthys minckleyi in Cuatro Cienegas, Mexico. Results suggest that competition is reduced between morphs in mixed-morph treatments relative to equal-density single-morph treatments. Field studies revealed that the morphs feed in different microhabitats and use different feeding behaviors within these microhabitats. These results suggest that the polymorphism is maintained in the population because it decreases competition between the morphs, and that differences in feeding behavior facilitate resource partitioning.

AB Local communities can be structured by both local interactions (competition, predation, environmental variables, etc.) and by regional interactions (dispersal of individuals between habitats). Using data from a three-year study on 34 neighboring ponds in an interconnected pond system, we tested whether zooplankton communities show a metacommunity structure, how much variation in zooplankton community structure is related to local environmental factors vs. spatial configuration (taking into account the dispersal pathways), and what environmental variables are the locally structuring forces. In three different years, we found evidence for a metacommunity structure. We also found that spatial and environmental components act independently of each other due to the small Geographic area and the high dispersal rates in this system. Despite these homogenizing forces. local environmental variables (associated with alternative equilibria in shallow lakes) were strongly related with zooplankton community structure in the studied years. This suggests that, even in this system of highly interconnected ponds, local environmental constraints can be strong enough to structure local communities.

AB Pollen movement within and among plants affects levels of inbreeding and, plant fitness as well as the spatial scale of genetic differentiation. Pollen movement has primarily been studied as a function of the direct relationships between plants and pollinators; however, nonpollinating floral visitors, such as some nectar robbers, may have indirect effects on pollen dispersal by altering plant-pollinator interactions. Theory predicts that nectar robbing should have indirect positive effects on plants by increasing pollen dispersal distance and reducing self-pollen transfer (geitonogamy) and inbreeding through changes in pollinator behavior associated with reduced nectar rewards. Here I experimentally tested the indirect effects of the nectar-robbing bumble bee, Bombus occidentalis, on the distance of pollen movement among plants and levels of pollen movement within plants (estimated using powdered fluorescent dyes as pollen analogues) using the self-incompatible, hummingbird-pollinated host, Ipomopsis aggregata. Empirical results did not fully support the theoretical predictions. Heavy levels of nectar (>80% of available flowers robbed) had no effect on the mean and mean-squared distance of dye dispersal within populations. However, hummingbird pollinators were 50% more likely to depart from a population after visiting a plant with low robbing relative to a plant With high robbing, suggesting that pollen dispersal among populations might be reduced in plants with high robbing relative to plants with low robbing. Heavy nectar robbing reduced levels of self-dye transfer by one-half. However, when I manipulated robbing levels and access to self-pollen, the costs associated with increased robbing and reduced pollinator visitation (e.g., reduced seed production) outweighed. any advantages associated with reduced geitonogamy. Taken together, these results suggest that the negative indirect effects of robbing on plant reproduction through decreased pollinator visitation and changes in pollinator departure from plants far exceed any positive effects associated with decreased geitonogamy. Given the widespread nature of plant attack by nectar robbers, these indirect effects are likely common phenomena structuring natural plant populations.

AB Characterization of the controls on annual nitrogen (N) cycling is critical to understanding the functioning of high-latitude ecosystems and to predicting their responses to perturbations. Here, we describe an experimental evaluation of the effects of season and vegetation on annual N cycling in the understory heath vegetation of a subarctic birch forest. Our approach was to follow the partitioning of an isotopically enriched (NH4Cl)-N-15 addition between microbes, plants, and the soil solution at intervals through winter, and in the following summer. To investigate the direct influence of vegetation on ecosystem N cycling, the isotope was added to control plots and to plots from which plant had been removed early in the previous growing season.
   Our results indicate that the dynamics of both microbial carbon and N were similar in treatment and control plots, suggesting that the presence of intact plants had negligible influence on seasonal patterns of microbial growth or N accumulation in the Soils of this ecosystem. Instead, ecosystem N cycling was dominated by a substantial turnover of recently acquired N from microbes during the winter-summer transition that corresponded to a significant increase in understory plant N-15 uptake.
   Vascular plant N-15 uptake and accumulation in belowground tissue was Substantial at the onset of winter, but ceased once full winter conditions developed. By contrast, there was a rapid resumption of vascular plant N uptake and strong allocation to aboveground tissue at the onset of summer. Vascular plant types varied strongly in N-15 enhancement. depending on physiological differences in N uptake capacity as well as differences in biomass, In particular, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Vaccinium myrtillus, and the herbs exhibited strong N-15 acquisition capacities, despite their relatively low biomass. We found no consistent evidence that the evergreen vs. deciduous leaf habit contributed to species differences in N uptake capacity, Species capacity for allocation of N-15 to new shoot tissue was closely correlated with aboveground production per unit total N and tended to be greatest in herbs and V myrtillus, suggesting that inherent physiological capacities for N uptake and tissue allocation are important determinants of species productivity.
   Our results suggest a hierarchy of controls on annual N cycling. The importance of wintertime influences on annual ecosystem N cycling was indicated by ongoing net mineralization by microbes beneath snow cover and a critical N release from microbes during the winter-summer transition. By contrast, plant N uptake was confined to the snow-free season. Thus, seasonal environmental changes caused a rapid microbial turnover of recently acquired N that then became available for plant uptake in the subsequent growing season. Although vascular plant species appeared to compete strongly with each other to acquire this N, neither their presence nor their total N uptake appreciably affected microbial N-cycling activity. Together, these results suggest that season exerts primary control on annual N cycling in this ecosystem, and that its effect on microbial N turnover is a major process supplying N to plants. By comparison, the effects of understory vegetation on N cycling were small within the time frame of this experiment.

AB Two distinct organizational states of kelp forest communities, foliose algal assemblages and deforested barren areas, typically display sharp discontinuities. Mechanisms responsible for maintaining these state differences were studied by manipulating various features of their boundary regions, Urchins in the barren areas had significantly smaller gonads than those in adjacent kelp stands, implying that food was a limiting resource for urchins in the barrens. The abundance of drift algae and living foliose algae varied abruptly across the boundary between kelp beds and barren areas. These observations raise the question of why urchins from barrens do not invade kelp stands to improve their fitness, By manipulating kelp and urchin densities at boundary regions and within kelp beds, we tested the hypothesis that kelp stands inhibit invasion of urchins. Urchins that were experimentally added to kelp beds persisted and reduced kelp abundance until winter storms either swept the urchins away or caused them to seek refuge within crevices. Urchins' invaded kelp bed margins when foliose algae were removed but were prevented from doing so when kelps were replaced with physical models. The sweeping motion of kelps over the seafloor apparently inhibits urchins from crossing the boundary between kelp stands and barren areas, thus maintaining these alternate stable states. Our findings Suggest that kelp stands are able to defend themselves from their most important herbivore, by combining their flexible morphology with the energy of wave-generated surge. The inhibitory influence of this interaction may be an important mechanism maintaining the patchwork mosaics of barren areas and kelp beds that characterize many kelp forest ecosystems.

AB Although hemiparasitic plants have a number of roles in shaping the structure and composition of plant communities, the impact of this group on ecosystem processes, such as decomposition and nutrient cycling, has been poorly studied. In order to better understand the potential role of hemiparasites in these processes, a comparison of leaf and litter tissue quality, nitrogen (N) resorption, and decomposability with those of a wide range of other plant groups (involving a total of 72 species and including other groups with access to alternative nutrient sources, such as nitrogen fixers and carnivorous plants) was undertaken in several sub-arctic habitats. The foliar N concentration of hemiparasites generally exceeded that of co-occurring species. Further, hemiparasites (and N fixers) exhibited lower N resorption efficiencies than their counterparts with no major alternative N source. As a consequence, annual and perennial hemiparasite litter contained, on average, 3.1% and 1.9% N, respectively, compared with 0.77-1.1% for groups without a major alternative N source. Hemiparasite litter lost significantly more mass during decomposition than many, but not all, co-occurring species. These results were combined with those of a litter trapping experiment to assess the potential impact of hemiparasites on nutrient cycling. The common sub-arctic hemiparasite Bartsia alpina was estimated to increase the total annual N input from litter to the soil by similar to42% within 5 cm of its stems, and by similar to53% across a site with a Bartsia alpina stem density of 43 stems/m(2). Our results therefore provide clear evidence in favor of a novel mechanism by which hemiparasites (in parallel with N-fixing species) may influence ecosystems in which they occur. Through the production of nutrient rich, rapidly decomposing litter, they have the potential to greatly enhance the availability of nutrients within patches where they are abundant, with possible consequent effects on small-scale biodiversity.

AB Water vapor and CO2 exchanges were measured by the eddy covariance method in 24 ecosystems along a transect from the Arctic coast to the latitudinal tree line in northern Alaska during three growing seasons. Variations in net ecosystem exchange across the region were controlled by differences in the net uptake of CO2 due to photosynthesis, rather than by differences in ecosystem respiration. Daytime CO2 uptake was related mainly to site differences in leaf area index, whereas nighttime CO2 efflux was related to leaf area index and soil moisture. Temperature had no effect on regional patterns of ecosystem respiration during the growing season. Regional variations in surface conductance were largely explained by the water content of the moss-soil layer. Water vapor and CO2 fluxes were poorly coupled because water vapor exchange was determined largely by evaporation from mosses, whereas CO2 exchange was controlled by vascular plant activity. This is in contrast to the close correlation between maximum rates of surface conductance and CO2 assimilation that is observed at the global scale. The results also suggest that the relationship between the maximum rates of surface conductance and stomatal conductance in arctic tundra departs markedly from the global pattern, because the moss layer dried more readily than a moist soil. These spatially distributed eddy covariance measurements revealed new functional relationships among water vapor and CO2 exchanges and their environmental controls in arctic tundra; however, there remains a need for winter flux observations and long-term measurements to understand the net effect of these processes on the annual carbon balance of the region.

AB Predicting the response of communities to climate change is a major challenge for ecology. Communities may well not respond as entities but be disrupted, particularly if trophic levels respond differently, but as yet there is no evidence for differential responses from natural systems. We therefore analyzed unusually detailed plant and animal data collected over 20 years from two grassland communities to determine whether functional group climate sensitivity differed between trophic levels. We found that sensitivity increases significantly with increasing trophic level. This differential sensitivity would lead to community destabilization under climate change, not simple geographical shifts, and consequently must be incorporated in predictive ecological. climate models.

AB Many organisms living in heterogeneous environments alter behaviors or morphology when developing in the presence of predators and subsequently incur associated sublethal fitness costs. Larvae of the mayfly Callibaetis ferrugineus hageni develop in beaver ponds with or without trout predators. We examined the potential sublethal fitness costs of developing in the presence of trout predators by comparing patterns of timing and size at emergence from ponds over two years, before and after manipulating trout densities. In addition, the behavior, timing, and size at emergence of larvae reared in mesocosms were compared between treatments with and without trout chemical cues. Timing of mayfly emergence and adult size was not affected by the manipulation of trout in the field, or by the presence of trout chemical cues in mesocosms. Observations of mayflies in mesocosms provided no evidence that predator cues induced antipredator behaviors, such as reduced activity or increased crypsis. Surprisingly, late instar larvae swam more frequently in the presence of trout cues during the middle of the day, a behavior that could increase their vulnerability to visually feeding predators. Thus, larvae did not exhibit any traits expected to increase survival in the presence of trout cues. The apparently maladaptive responses to trout may result from phylogenetic inertia or conflicting selection pressures encountered when developing in fishless habitats. The evolution of plasticity to trout in Callibaetis may be inhibited by frequent dispersal from fishless source populations.

AB We evaluated whether the kind of nutrient limitation (N, P, or K) may affect species richness-productivity patterns and subsequently may explain variation in species richness and in richness of threatened species. We present a data set from previous studies in wetlands in Poland, Belgium, and The Netherlands and examine species richness-productivity patterns for vascular plants in all 150 sites together as well as for N-, P-, and K-limited sites separately. The kind of nutrient limitation was assessed by N:P, N:K, and K: P ratios in the vegetation. Critical values for these ratios were derived from a literature review of fertilization experiments. The kind of nutrient limitation influenced species richness-productivity patterns in our 150 sites through large differences in productivity. P (co)limitation occurred only at low productivity, K (co)-limitation up to intermediate productivity, and N limitation along the entire productivity gradient. There was a decreasing trend in species richness with increasing productivity for K (co)-limited sites, whereas for both the N-limited sites and P (co)-limited sites a sort of "filled hump-shaped curve" was observed. The species richness-productivity relationship for threatened species was restricted to a much narrower productivity range than that for all species. Richness of threatened species was higher in P (co)-limited sites than in N-limited sites, suggesting that increased P availabilities in wetlands may be particularly important in causing disappearance of threatened species in western Europe. The role of nutrient limitation in species richness-productivity relationships not only reveals mechanisms that may explain variation in species richness and occurrence of threatened species, but it also may be important for nature management practice.

AB Theories of the evolution of niche breadth usually depend. on the assumption that genotypes that are well adapted to exploit one habitat or resource are not well adapted to others. Such "trade-offs" are often apparent in interspecific comparisons, but have been harder to document at the within-population level. Selection experiments provide a promising. means for detecting within-population trade-offs: if selection for adaptation to one environment (e.g., diet, host, temperature) reproducibly lowers fitness in another, trade-offs are the likeliest explanation. Here, I describe strategies for using selection experiments to detect ecological trade-offs and-discuss some of the ambiguities that can arise in interpreting the results of such experiments. I also review two sets of studies that found evidence for trade-offs using selection experiments.

AB Spatial patterns of tree species in forested landscapes are regulated by a variety of environmental and disturbance factors. Biological factors such as disturbance and competition that operate within a local neighborhood (neighborhood factors) might also influence these patterns. We sought empirical evidence for the role of neighborhood factors in determining spatial patterns of abundance of dominant tree species in the 3160-ha Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), a second growth, northern hardwood-conifer forest in New Hampshire, USA. We measured tree abundance patterns and a suite of environmental and disturbance factors expected to regulate these patterns in 0.05-ha plots distributed throughout the Hubbard Brook Valley. Environmental and disturbance effects were modeled using linear regression with spatially correlated errors described by semivariograms. These models explained 26-62% of the variation in abundance among the seven tree species that comprise 90% of the total basal area in the HBEF Semivariograms described residual spatial autocorrelation of the abundance of each tree species after accounting for environmental and disturbance effects. One species, Betula alleghaniensis, did not exhibit significant residual spatial autocorrelation in its spatial pattern of abundance. The other six species exhibited abundance patterns with highly significant residual spatial autocorrelation, suggesting that factors other than environment and disturbance are needed to adequately explain their spatial patterns, of abundance. The range and normalized sill semivariogram values from the residual spatial autocorrelation of the different species were consistent with a role of seed dispersal distance and root sprouting in regulating patterns of abundance of several. tree species in the HBEF We argue that neighborhood factors significantly influence patterns of tree species in forested landscapes.

AB Risk to prey imposed by intraguild predation (IGP) can be influenced by a number of factors, yet to date, few studies have measured the contributions of these factors to overall risk. A three-species IGP system with larvae of the dragonfly Anax junius as IG (top) predators, larvae of the dragonfly Plathemis lydia as IG prey (intermediate predators), and fathead minnow hatchlings (Pimephales promelas) as shared prey was used to estimate the contribution of the following three factors to shared-prey mortality rate in combined predator treatments: (1) the trophic effect of the IG predator on IG prey density; (2) the effect of reduced shared prey consumption by the IG prey in the presence of the IG predator; and (3) the effect of alternative prey for the IG predator. These factors were integrated into a model of multiple predator effects. To quantify minnow mortality, P. promelas were exposed to A. junius only, P. lydia only, A. junius and P. lydia, or neither in a two-by-two factorial design. Additional treatments, in which one or both predators were unable to feed, were used to isolate behavioral (activity level) changes in dragonfly larvae.
   When-predators preyed in combination on P. promelas their impact was less than that of the summed effects of the two predators, each in the absence of the other-a result termed risk reduction. A. junius consumed a significant number of P. lydia when they were present (i.e., IGP), and behavioral interactions between A. junius and P. lydia were asymmetric. The presence of A. junius caused P. lydia to become less active, while the presence of P. lydia elicited a diet shift in A. junius to include some P. lydia. Interactions between predator species, specifically IGP, influenced prey survival. Trophic and behavioral effects of IGP were similar in magnitude. These results highlight the importance of trophic and behavioral interactions in predator-prey systems and also suggest that effects of multiple predators may not be predictable based on the sum of individual effects. Determining the effects of multiple predators requires the identification of mechanisms that contribute to nonadditive prey responses.

AB A pressing problem for ecologists is determining whether our understanding of communities, often developed from work at fine scales, can explain processes across broader scales. Here, we explore whether models of positive interactions developed in southern New England can be applied to geographic scales. Salt marsh plants may interact positively by ameliorating harsh physical conditions such as salinity stress. Because marsh porewater salinities are higher in low- vs. high-latitude marshes, we tested the hypothesis that positive interactions are increasingly important at low latitudes. Previous work supported this hypothesis at the regional scale: within New England, positive interactions were rare in Maine but common in Rhode Island. We conducted parallel experiments in Georgia and Alabama to determine whether similar results would be obtained in a geographic comparison. Nine species of salt marsh plants were transplanted into control plots or plots with neighboring vegetation removed, in three marsh zones, at two sites each in Georgia and Alabama. Removing neighbors increased porewater salinities; nevertheless, plants usually performed best in neighbor-removal treatments, indicating that most interactions were competitive rather than facilitative.
   Several mechanisms might explain these results. For-widely distributed species, southern individuals may be more salt tolerant than northern conspecifics. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the salt tolerance of northern and southern conspecifics of three species in a common garden experiment. In two species, southern plants were more salt tolerant than northern conspecifics. Although this pattern may explain the rarity of facilitation in the south for some species, it cannot explain our overall results because few species were studied in both geographic regions. The most likely explanation for our results is that northern marsh floras are dominated by salt-sensitive species that are likely to be facilitated by neighbors, whereas southern marsh floras are dominated by salt-tolerant species that are unlikely to benefit substantially from neighbor amelioration of soil salinities.
   These results illustrate the difficulties inherent in extrapolating results from even well understood systems to different geographic locations or scales. Intraspecific adaptations and community composition are often likely to vary geographically, complicating our efforts to construct geographically robust generalities about community structure and processes.

AB The relationship between plant diversity and nitrate leaching into groundwater was investigated in a mid-European semi-natural grassland ecosystem. An experimental approach was used to directly manipulate plant diversity in the field, while holding other environmental factors constant. Species loss was simulated by establishing grassland communities of 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, and 0 plant species, composed of 3, 2, or I functional groups (grasses. legumes, and non-legume herbs). Every diversity treatment was replicated with several different species mixtures. Nitrate leaching was determined by continuous extraction of soil solution below the rooting zone and modeling of seepage rates. The concentration of nitrate in the soil solution was highly variable within each level of diversity. In bare ground plots and several low-diversity mixtures containing legumes, nitrate concentrations were higher than the official European Union threshold value for drinking water of 50 mg/L, with maximum values of up to 350 mg/L measured in Trifolium pratense monocultures. Total annual loss of nitrate was unaffected by the number of plant species or functional groups, but it was highly dependent on the specific species composition of the communities, and plots with legumes lost significantly more nitrate than plots without them. Aboveground biomass had no influence on nitrate loss, whereas leaching was negatively correlated with increasing root biomass. The abundance of legumes within a community, litter decomposition rates, and net nitrification were all positively correlated with total nitrate loss. However, in those communities containing legumes, leaching decreased with increasing diversity, because higher species richness led to a reduction in legume dominance, to a reduced nitrate supply through nitrification, and to a complementary uptake of nitrate by grasses and non-leguminous herbs. Based on these results, we expect that increasing the diversity of non-leguminous species or functional groups would reduce the risk of nitrate leaching in low-diversity grass-clover mixtures of ley-farming systems, while allowing for a more efficient exploitation of the beneficial fertilization effect provided by legumes.

AB Many studies on life history strategies of small mammals under predation risk are based on assumptions that mammalian predators use scent marking from prey in searching and hunting. This is especially true for small mustelids hunting in the tunnels and cavities of their prey. It is assumed that weasels use the estrous signs of female voles as hunting cues, which exposes such females to a more pronounced risk of predation. We studied the preferences of 57 least weasels (Mustela nivalis nivalis) toward odor cues from four different reproductive categories of the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus). In the first experiment, weasels selected clearly for vole odors over clean bedding in a Y-maze arena. The second experiment demonstrated that there was no difference in weasel preference between estrous and pregnant or lactating females. Thirdly, there was no preference for odors from dominant vs. subordinate males. Finally, we offered weasels a dyadic choice between olfactory signs of six possible combinations of four prey categories: reproductive females, reproductive males, immature females, and immature males. There was no clear preference for any of the categories; only immature males seemed to be preferred less than females of the same age. Our study does not support the hypothesis that the weasel would have clear olfactory preference for some reproductive category of voles. However, in the field, factors like spacing behavior, mobility and acoustic cues of the prey, and conspicuousness of the nest site might affect the behavior of hunting weasels and individual vulnerability of prey.

AB Nitrogen limitation of many temperate plant communities makes the impacts of fossorial mammal activity on soil N dynamics an interesting and potentially important topic. We determined the effects of gopher mound building on soil N transformations by measuring gross rates of N mineralization and nitrification using short-term N-15 pool dilution methods. net rates of mineralization and nitrification using longer-term buried-bag determinations, inorganic N pools, and soil physical characteristics in gopher-disturbed soil, bare soil, and intact vegetated soil in a California annual grassland during the spring growing season. Soil bulk densities were lower and temperatures were higher in gopher mound material. Neither gross nor net rates of N mineralization or nitrification were statistically distinguishable among gopher-disturbed, bare, and vegetated soils. However, larger pools of NH4 and NO3 were present in mound and bare soils than in vegetated soils, nitrification potential was higher in mound soils than in vegetated soils, and the rate constant for microbial NO3 consumption was higher in vegetated soil than in bare or gopher-mound soil. Gopher removal of plants from this annual grassland was the primary mechanism of impact on N cycling through both elimination of plant uptake of inorganic N and by reduction of root-enhanced microbial immobilization of NO3-N.

AB Matrix population models are important tools for research and management of populations. Estimating the parameters of these models is an important step in applying them to real populations. Multistate capture-recapture methods have provided a useful means for estimating survival and parameters of transition between locations or life history states but have mostly relied on the assumption that the state occupied by each detected animal is known with certainty. Nevertheless, in some cases animals can be misclassified. Using multiple capture sessions within each period of interest, we developed a method that adjusts estimates of transition probabilities for bias due to misclassification. We applied this method to 10 years of sighting data for a population of Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) in order to estimate the annual probability of transition from non-breeding to breeding status. Some sighted females were unequivocally classified as breeders because they were clearly accompanied by a first-year calf. The remainder were classified, sometimes erroneously, as nonbreeders because an attendant first-year calf was not observed or was classified as more than one year old. We estimated a conditional breeding probability of 0.31 +/- 0.04 (estimate +/- 1 SE) when we ignored misclassification bias, and 0.61 +/- 0.09 when we accounted for misclassification.

AB Induced defenses are widespread in nature, and in amphibian larvae they Lire often expressed as altered behavior and changes in tail shape. color, and size, Theory predicts that induced defenses should be costly in the absence of a predator threat. No costs have been found for these defenses after metamorphosis. In this study. we tested for induced defenses in western toads, Bufo boreas. and measured larval and postmetamorphic consequences of these responses. Larvae were raised in either the presence or absence of nonlethal predator cues. Defense responses to these larval treatments were measured during the larval stage and shortly after metamorphosis using both predator bioassays and quantification of the putative chemical defense common in toads, bufadienolides. We found no differences in larval morphology, growth rate, or development rate between the predator and control treatments. In the larval bioassays, some types of invertebrate predator, consumed significantly fewer of the B. boreas larvae that were reared with predator Cues compared to the control treatments. Bufadienolides were not present in B. boreas larvae. In the postmetamorphic bioassays, tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) had longer handling times when consuming B. boreas that had developed in larval environments without predator cues compared to predator-treatment B. boreas. However, postmetamorphic B. boreas from predator cue larval environments had significantly higher concentrations of bufadienolides than did those from larval environments without predators. suggesting that these defenses are ineffective against tiger salamanders. Our results demonstrate that there is plasticity in the chemical defenses of toads and Suggest that induced larval defenses may incur costs that are only apparent after metamorphosis.

AB We used 16s rDNA sequences to identify novel species of. cyanobacteria beneath translucent quartz pebbles in the desert pavement on an alluvial piedmont of the Coxcomb Mountains in the southern Mojave Desert, California, USA. Transmission of light, as measured with an integrating sphere, was about 0.08% beneath the thickest pieces of quartz (25 mm) harboring these hypolithic autotrophs. The photosynthetic rate ranged from 0.1 to 1.0 mumol(.)m(-2.)s(-1) in the linear range of its response to light (PAR of 0-50 mumol(.)m(-2.)s(-1)), over which the apparent quantum-use efficiency was 0.019. Light-saturated rates of 1.7-2.7 mumol(.)m(-2.)s(-1) were recorded at light intensities of 200-400 mumol(.)m(-2.)s(-1). The hypolithic community had an upper thermal tolerance of >90degreesC in laboratory conditions. The quartz pebbles confer a modest greenhouse effect that may be important for photosynthetic activity during cool, wet, wintertime periods that prevail in the Mojave Desert.

AB Food supply is widely considered to be a major factor in determining life history traits and reproductive performance of birds. However, large spatial and temporal variation in natural available food supply is not always paralleled by proportional changes in energy demand by breeding birds. This necessarily results in variation in the supply-demand ratio and the amount of food available per unit mass of nestling. Because reproductive performance should respond to increases in available supply as a saturation curve, reaching a plateau above A certain threshold of food supply, we predict that variation in supply should change the intensity of selection on reproductive traits. We first tested this prediction using long-term data on nestling growth and survival in Blue Tits (Parus caeruleus) breeding over a gradient of habitat richness in Corsica, France. This long-term data analysis evaluates the effect of variation in food supply available to breeding tits using three surrogate variables: interannual variation in peak caterpillar abundance (caterpillar frass fall), offset between breeding date and peak caterpillar abundance, and natural variation in clutch size. We also used an experimental brood size manipulation (+/-3 chicks) to test the effect of varying brood demand on nestling growth. Results of the long-term data analysis show that all three variables affect fledging mass and fledging success in poor habitats, while only fledging mass is affected by variation in offset in rich habitats. Moreover, mean annual fledging success and fledging mass is strongly affected by annual variation in peak caterpillar abundance at low levels' of-abundance, but these effects disappear when food becomes abundant (saturation threshold level of 373 and 560 mg frass.m(-2) .d(-1) for fledging success and fledging mass, respectively). Brood size manipulations confirm these results. In rich habitats, breeding birds can raise three extra chicks without any apparent effects on chick growth, while in poor habitats, chick growth is significantly reduced with brood enlargement. Our study shows that although food limitation can play an important role, it may not always be the primary force shaping life history traits.

AB Although omnivory is common and widespread across many animal taxa, the evolutionary origin of omnivory, the selective forces that promote or constrain omnivory, and the morphological, physiological, and behavioral hurdles that animals have to overcome to become omnivores have not been studied. The goal of this paper is to stimulate the development of ideas concerning the evolution of omnivory. We focus on the terrestrial lineages of the insect order Heteroptera and use published life history data and recent phylogenies to test two hypotheses concerning the evolutionary origin of feeding on both plants and prey: (1) that the propensity to feed on seeds and pollen is correlated with the evolution of omnivory, and (2) that broad host range (polyphagy) is correlated with the evolution of omnivory. In order to test these hypotheses, we mapped the plant part consumed and host plant range of insect species in two heteropteran suborders onto their respective phylogenies and used phylogenetically independent contrasts to test for correlations of these traits with omnivory. We found evidence that seed and pollen feeding and broad host ranges are correlated with the evolution of omnivory within both ancestrally herbivorous and ancestrally predaceous lineages of terrestrial heteropterans.

AB A number of authors have documented a higher occurrence of tree seedlings below the canopy of adult trees than in openings, particularly in mesic conditions, where increases in resources in openings stimulate the growth of competing shade-intolerant forbs. These patterns may be explained by indirect facilitation. Indirect facilitation has been mainly explored using models, and too few experimental studies have been conducted to understand the conditions under which it is likely to occur. We test here the indirect facilitation model in natural openings of subalpine forests and explore the relationship that may exist between species response to indirect interactions and life-history traits of target seedlings. Two evergreen conifers (Picea abies and Abies alba) and two deciduous broad-leaved angiosperms (Fagus sylvatica and Acer pseudoplatanus) that dominate the mixed mesic forests of the northern external French Alps were planted in a tall forb community invading natural forest openings. Seedlings were grown for three growing seasons, with and without competing forbs, and with and without a 50% shade cloth, simulating the relatively open canopy of the surrounding forests. The direct effects of shade were negative for all four species, but the conifers were much more negatively affected by shade than the angiosperms. Shade strongly reduced aboveground biomass of competing forbs, which improved the availability of nitro-en for the tree seedlings. However, because the indirect positive effect of competition release was outweighed by the direct negative effect of light reduction, the net effect was negative for all four species. Species' responses to the indirect effects of shade were correlated with species traits; additional competition was the highest for the most conservative and shade-intolerant species, Picea, and the lowest for the most nutrient-demanding and shade-tolerant species, Acer. We conclude that species traits may determine how a species responds to indirect interactions, but that further studies are needed to explore the real potential of indirect facilitation to determine patterns of tree seedling distribution.

AB Forest structure strongly influences ambient environmental conditions such as light and temperature, but most studies on habitat selection by mobile organisms have either ignored canopy structure or treated it as a dichotomous variable (e.g., "shady" or "sunny"). Furthermore, the predominance of active diurnal species as model organisms in such studies has left many unanswered questions about the importance of vegetation-related variables for nocturnal and sedentary species (e.g., what does "shade" mean to an organism that moves at night and sits in a cave all day?). We used hemispherical photography to quantify canopy structure and examine its role in determining the thermal microenvironments available to a rock-dwelling nocturnal snake (Hoplocephalus bungaroides) across two different spatial scales. The narrow plateaus inhabited by the snakes in southeastern Australia are highly heterogeneous with respect to vegetation: east-facing aspects are densely covered whereas west-facing aspects are patchy mosaics. We found that temperatures of potential retreat sites increased with increasing canopy openness, but the definitive determinant of retreat-site temperature was incident radiation intensity, which depended upon the location of canopy gaps relative to the sun path. This factor restricted the snakes to west-facing cliff tops, and there only to an optimal subset of rocks that received adequate irradiance. Moreover, thermal regimes of retreat sites displayed higher maxima and were evening shifted relative to randomly sampled rocks in the same area. Our results suggest that thermally suitable retreat sites are a limiting resource, and that local increases in vegetation density might contribute to the decline of this endangered species.

AB Experiments in ecology are usually designed to provide tests of hypotheses on the influence of the mean intensity of causal processes, whereas the variance around mean effects has been largely overlooked as a causal force in biological assemblages. Repetition of experiments in space and time provides an estimate of this variability at specific scales, but does not explain how changes in variance generate structure in assemblages and the extent to which variance and mean intensity interact. This paper seeks to identify suitable procedures for empirical analyses on the influence of variance and mean intensity of predictor ecological variables on spatial and temporal patterns in natural populations. A survey of the ecological literature indicates that temporal variability in studies of disturbance and in analyses of consumer-resource interactions is generally expressed in terms of frequency of events. This is inappropriate, as frequency confounds the variance with the mean effect size of a process. A possible solution to the problem involves experimental designs in which levels of intensity and those of variability are chosen independently over explicit spatial or temporal scales and treated as fixed, orthogonal factors. Examples are offered for various scenarios of consumer-resource interactions along with indications for statistical tests of hypotheses. Such novel approaches have important ramifications for understanding variability in a wide range of ecological contexts and for predicting the response of assemblages to increased environmental fluctuations, including those expected under modified climate conditions.

AB Experimental evolution is relevant to ecology because it can connect physiology, and in particular metabolism, to questions in ecology. The investigation of the linkage between the environment and the evolution of metabolism is tractable because these experiments manipulate a very simple environment to produce predictable evolutionary outcomes. In doing so, microbial selection experiments can examine the causal elements of natural selection: how specific traits in varying environments will yield different fitnesses. Here, we review the methodology of microbial evolution experiments and address three issues that are relevant to ecologists: genotype-by-environment interactions, ecological diversification due to specialization, and negative frequency-dependent selection. First, we expect that genotype-by-environment interactions will be ubiquitous in biological systems. Second, while antagonistic pleiotropy is implicated in some cases of ecological specialization, other mechanisms also seem to be at work. Third, while negative frequency-dependent selection can maintain ecological diversity in laboratory systems, a mechanistic (biochemical) analysis of these systems suggests that negative frequency dependence may only apply within a narrow range of environments if resources are substitutable. Finally, we conclude that microbial experimental evolution needs to avail itself of molecular techniques that could enable a mechanistic understanding of ecological diversification in these simple systems.

AB Although agricultural grassland soils have inherently high rates of net nitrogen (N) mineralization, they often have soil concentrations of soluble organic N that are comparable to inorganic N. We set out to examine in situ the significance of organic N for plant nutrition in grasslands of differing management intensity and soil fertility. Using in situ dual-labeling techniques (glycine-2-C-13-N-15) we measured preferential uptake of amino-acid N vs. inorganic N [((NH4)-N-15)(2)SO4] in early and late season in low-productivity Agrostis capillaris-Festuca ovina grassland and in agriculturally improved, high-productivity Lolium perenne-dominated grassland. The dominant soluble-N form differed greatly between grasslands. Inorganic N (especially nitrate N) dominated the soluble N pool of the highly productive improved grassland whereas amino acid N was the dominant soluble N form in the low-productivity unimproved grassland. There was no difference in the amount of N-15 taken up by plants from the two N forms in either grassland. However, our data indicate that amino-acid N was taken up directly by plants of both grasslands and that more N was captured in this way by plants of low-productivity grassland where amino acids were the dominant soluble N form in soil. Our data from both grasslands also indicate significant microbial competition for added N-15 from both N sources, but especially in the low-productivity grassland where the bulk of N-15 added was sequestered by the microbial biomass. A significantly greater amount of added N-15 was captured by the microbial biomass in the unimproved than in the improved grassland, and substantially more N-15 was detected in the microbial biomass than in plant tissue in the unimproved grassland. On the basis of our findings, we predict that subsequent microbial turnover and release of this N into the plant-soil system is the major pathway for plant N capture in these temperate grasslands. Microbial sequestration of added N might be an important mechanism of N retention in these grasslands, especially in the low-productivity systems where microbial N sink strength is greater and organic matter slowly accumulates.

AB Using an experimental eucalypt forest of known pedigree and laboratory feeding trials, we examined the relative importance of plant ontogeny (heteroblasty), genetic variation among host trees, canopy height, and leaf age as potential drivers that could affect the distribution and feeding preference of a common insect herbivore, Chrysophtharta agricola. We found that ontogeny is a major factor affecting this insect. Its importance rivaled leaf physiological age, a well-documented factor, which served as our standard for judging the relative importance of other effects. Three patterns emerged: (1) In the field, beetle feeding was nine times greater in the adult zone than in the juvenile zone of heteroblastic trees (i.e., trees with both adult and juvenile foliage). (2) Laboratory feeding trials confirmed their strong preference for adult foliage. (3) Although eucalypt species, hybrid cross type (F-1, F-2, and backcrosses), and canopy height also exhibited significant effects on beetle feeding in laboratory trials, their relative importance was much less than ontogeny and leaf physiological age. We conclude that beetles perceive greater variation in host quality within individual plants than between different eucalypt species and their hybrids. The magnitude of these effects argues that ontogeny may rival other better studied plant traits that affect herbivores. We discuss how genetic regulation of phenotypic expression in plants may affect herbivore populations and structure communities.

AB Following Hurricane Lili, which passed directly over the site of our ongoing study in Great Exuma, Bahamas, herbivory increased on devastated islands exposed to the storm surge, but not on protected islands. Observations suggested that foliage sprouting on severely damaged shrubs was more susceptible to herbivores than was new foliage on undamaged shrubs. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a controlled field experiment: hurricane damage was simulated by pruning shrubs on replicated islands. Seven months after the manipulation, herbivory was 68% higher on pruned shrubs than on controls. Leaf size and percentage of nitrogen were higher, and leaf toughness and trichome density were lower on pruned shrubs than on controls. The experimental results indicate that enhanced herbivory on exposed islands following Hurricane Lili was caused, at least in part, by increased susceptibility of the sprouted foliage to herbivorous arthropods. Because sprouting occurs on many woody plants following natural or arithropogenic disturbances, the findings in this study may have broad implications.

AB Survival of larvae of highly fecund fishes is often considered to be random, although some investigators have hypothesized that survivors are exceptional individuals. If behavior is important to survival, individuals that perform both well and repeatably will be favored. We conducted experiments on red drum larvae (Sciaenops ocellatus, mean length = 7.7 mm) to assess individual variability in skills related to foraging and predator evasion. We measured routine swimming speed and, for responses to two startle stimuli, response score, latency, distance, duration. and speed, We tested 100 larvae five times each. A large proportion of larvae exhibited repeatable performance for 10 of the performance variables, However. repeatability (or performance level) in one skill was not correlated with repeatability (or level) in an independent skill, except for a positive correlation between acoustic and visual response scores. This result suggested that the level of attentiveness to predators varies among individuals. The absence of individuals with consistently low, performance was taken as evidence for historical selection on performance and repeatability of escape speeds and distances. Individuals that performed repeatably or well in multiple skills represented 1-2% of the sample. which is not a trivial number of individuals when extrapolated over a female's reproductive lifetime. The persistence of many poor performers may be due to limited heritability of behavioral traits, a trade-off of behavioral skills with another selected trait, or extreme variability in the nature of mortality in coastal environments. The presence of repeatable behavior and apparent selection for a small number of related traits imply that, under some circumstances. survivors of a cohort may be individuals with exceptional behavioral skills, but behavior may be more important to survival and recruitment in fish larvae from more stable environments.

AB We present observations and experimental results supporting the view that macroalgal morphology can represent a balance between maximizing photosynthetic ability and limiting susceptibility of the thallus to mechanical damage. The relationships among morphology, water flow, and photosynthesis were examined for five algal species representing three functional forms of marine macroalgae at Santa Catalina Island, California, USA. The relationship between surface area/volume ratio (SA/V) and rates of biomass-specific net photosynthesis (NP) across functional-form groups was examined to test the hypothesis that NP is related positively to SAN. The rate of NP increased with increasing SAN across functional groups. This relationship then was examined within a functional group for two species, Dictyopteris undulata and, Zonaria farlowii, which are morphologically variable among sites. Flow measurements and morphometric analysis of thalli of D. undulata and Z farlowii at two wave-exposed and two wave-protected sites indicated that intraspecific morphological variation corresponded to variation in wave exposure. A field experiment that manipulated rates of flow in situ resulted in morphological changes in D. undulata and Z. farlowii, indicating that water motion was responsible for the observed morphological plasticity. To examine the interaction between morphology and water flow on algal physiology, NP was estimated for morphotypes of D. undulata and Z farlowii from wave-exposed and wave-protected sites. At saturating photon flux densities, NP was affected significantly by flow speed, particularly for morphotypes from the wave-protected site. For these morphotypes, increased flow speeds resulted in sustained, then decreased NP as flow speeds exceeded 17 cm/s, suggesting that water flow may affect NP at low flow speeds by mitigating mass transfer limitation and at high flow speeds by changing light interception and flow within the compacted thallus. The plasticity of morphologies and the interaction of these morphotypes with, flow may represent a trade-off between maximizing NP and reducing the susceptibility of the thallus to mechanical damage and/or dislodgement by hydrodynamic forces.

AB Common Ravens (Corvus corax) in the Mojave Desert of California, USA are subsidized by anthropogenic resources. Large numbers of nonbreeding ravens are attracted to human developments and thus are spatially restricted, whereas breeding ravens are distributed more evenly throughout the area. We investigated whether the spatial distribution of risk of predation by ravens to juveniles of the threatened desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) was determined by the spatial distribution of (1) nonbreeding ravens at human developments (leading to "spillover" predation) or (2) breeding individuals throughout developed and undeveloped areas (leading to "hyperpredation"). Predation risk, measured using styrofoam models of juvenile desert tortoises, was high near places Attracting large numbers of nonbreeding ravens, near successful nests, and far from successful nests when large numbers of nonbreeding ravens were present. Patterns consistent with both "spillover" predation and "hyperpredation" were thug observed, attributed to the nonbreeding and breeding segments of the population, respectively. Furthermore, because locations of successful nests changed almost annually, consistent low-predation refugia for juvenile desert tortoises were nearly nonexistent. Consequently, anthropogenic resources for ravens could indirectly lead to the suppression, decline, or even extinction, of desert tortoise populations.

AB Phenological patterns of flowering and fruiting can be influenced by the effects-of reproductive time on seed production. We propose here that these patterns are also influenced by phenological effects on offspring quality. Furthermore, we hypothesize that there are cross-generational trade-offs between parental and offspring components of parental fitness influencing the evolution of reproductive phenology.
   To test our hypothesis, we examined the multigenerational effects of flowering and fruiting phenology in Plantago lanceolata. Offspring of 30 families were transplanted into field plots to measure the effects of onsets of flowering and fruiting, duration of fruiting, percentage fungal infection, and damage by grasshoppers on total seed production, our measure of the within-generational component of parental fitness. To gather information about cross-generational contributions to parental fitness, we assessed the quality of offspring produced at different times in terms of seed mass and germination.
   Families significantly differed in flowering and fruiting onsets. Larger plants began flowering earlier, and earlier flowering plants matured fruits earlier and produced fruits for a longer time. Significant family-mean correlations among these traits, suggest that selection on any one, trait will change all three traits. A negative family-mean correlation between fruiting onset and seed production suggests that we can expect an antagonistic trade-off in response to selection on these two traits. Early fruiting significantly reduced seed predation by grasshoppers and increased seed production. In contrast, late-maturing seeds were significantly heavier and germinated more rapidly than did early-maturing seeds produced by the same plants. The directions of the multigenerational effects support the hypothesis that there are cross-generational trade-offs between parental and offspring components of parental fitness. The experiments indicate that multigenerational fitness effects should be considered in future studies addressing the evolution of flowering and fruiting phenology.

AB Coupled trophic interactions with specialist predators or resources are thought to be primarily responsible for generating delayed density dependence. Previous theoretical studies suggest that autocorrelation in exogenous factors could generate apparent negative delayed density dependence in populations regulated only by direct density dependence. Using both linear and nonlinear models, we show that autocorrelated exogenous factors can generate the spurious appearance of not only negative, but also positive, delayed density dependence in populations regulated only by direct density dependence. Evidence for negative delayed density dependence is found mainly in populations exhibiting monotonic deterministic stability, whereas evidence for positive delayed density dependence is found mainly in populations exhibiting damped or persistent two-point cycles, or more complex deterministic dynamics. We argue that fluctuating resources (e.g., mast seeding) in bottom-up controlled communities could qualify as autocorrelated exogenous factors and cause apparent delayed density dependence in the population of their consumers.

AB Analyses of changes in size distributions over time frequently suggest that mortality rates depend on body size. Such observations, however, are probably confounded with changes in size due to growth. We describe a parametric method by which the size dependence of both mortality and growth may simultaneously be inferred from pairs of size distributions collected at different times. The method is tested in a Monte Carlo study and found to have sampling properties similar to those of other methods that require more data.
   Survival of the first winter of life appears to be size dependent in a diverse array of taxa, although few prior studies have accounted for growth. Analysis of sizes of Menidia menidia (Atlantic silverside) from three different latitudes, revealed that changes in size distributions through winter resulted from growth in southern populations and mortality in the north. Winter mortality was better described by a power function of size than an exponential. Allometric exponents increased with latitude and were greater than predicted from metabolic- or starvation-based models. The steepness of the estimated survivorship curves imply that winter mortality in M. menidia is more consistent with a threshold effect perhaps attributable to offshore migration.

AB Plant species exhibiting polymorphisms with respect to flower color are widespread. Our understanding of the selection pressures that may maintain these color polymorphisms has primarily been confined to one set of organisms-pollinators. Yet, selection on flower color may also be driven by other agents, such as herbivores, especially in cases where pollinators and herbivores are using the same or correlated traits to select plants. A wealth of studies have documented pollinator preference for anthocyanin-recessive color morphs (A-; yellow and white flowers) of wild radish, Raphanus sativus, over anthocyanin-dominant morphs (A+; pink and bronze flowers); yet, differences in pollination alone do not explain the maintenance of the flower color polymorphism. Here, we ask whether variation in flower color in R. sativus influences the preference and performance of herbivores for A- flower color morphs vs. A+ flower color morphs in four types of herbivores (generalist and specialist Lepidoptera, slugs, aphids, and thrips). We found that all herbivores except for aphids and thrips preferred flowering A- color morphs compared to A+ morphs of R. sativus. Furthermore, all herbivores except larvae of specialist and generalist Lepidoptera performed better on A- color morphs. Differences in plant secondary chemistry may play a role in differential herbivore preference and performance on the anthocyanin flower color morphs. Chemical analyses of leaf secondary compounds (indole glucosinolates) revealed that A+ color morphs produced higher concentrations of indole glucosinolates than A- morphs in the presence of herbivore damage. Therefore, herbivores may exhibit lower preference for A+ color morphs, and these morphs may support lower herbivore performance because they are heavily defended once damaged. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to document differential preference and performance of herbivores for different flower color morphs. Previous studies have shown that increased herbivore damage can have profound negative direct and indirect effects on the reproduction of R. sativus. The data presented here suggest that differential preference and performance of herbivores for R. sativus color morphs may counter selection on flower color exerted by pollinators.

AB We explored the spatial structure of seed size variation and tested whether seed size differed between native and exotic populations in two invasive species. Seed of Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom) is significantly heavier in its exotic range, whereas seed of Ulex europaeus (European gorse) is no different between ranges. This result suggests that seed size in C. scoparius is either adaptively or phenotypically responsive to conditions in its exotic range or that plants with large seeds were preferentially introduced. We found that modern ornamental broom seed was no bigger than seed from natural or naturalized populations, suggesting that large seed size in the exotic range is not due to preferential introduction of ornamental varieties with large seeds. Most previous studies of trait differences between native and exotic ranges in invasive species have not taken variation throughout the ranges into account. This is the most comprehensive survey of seed size variation in any species, and the first time that variation in a trait of an invasive species has been studied from individual plant level up to global ranges. Demographic rates can be affected by seed attributes making this study an important first step in understanding how population processes may differ between native and exotic ranges.

AB The functional response of a predator to changing prey density is an important determinant of stability of predator-prey systems. We show how Manly's selection indices can be used to distinguish between hyperbolic and sigmoidal models of a predator functional response to primary prey density in the presence of alternative prey. Specifically, an inverse relationship between prey density and preference for that prey results in a hyperbolic functional response while a positive relationship can yield either a hyperbolic or sigrnoidal functional response, depending on the form and relative magnitudes of the density-dependent preference model, attack rate, and handling time. As an example, we examine wolf (Canis lupus) functional response to moose (Alces alces) density in the presence of caribou (Rangifer tarandus). The use of selection indices to evaluate the form of the functional response has significant advantages over previous attempts to fit Holling's functional response curves to killing-rate data directly, including increased sensitivity, use of relatively easily collected data, and consideration of other explanatory factors (e,g., weather, seasons, productivity).

AB Population viability analysis is an important tool for conservation biologists, and matrix models that incorporate stochasticity are commonly used for this purpose. However, stochastic simulations may require assumptions about the distribution of matrix parameters, and modelers often select a statistical distribution that seems reasonable without sufficient data to test its fit. We used data from long-term (5-10 year) studies with 27 populations of five perennial plant species to compare seven methods of incorporating environmental stochasticity. We estimated stochastic population growth rate (a measure of viability) using a matrix-selection method, in which whole observed matrices were selected at random at each time step of the model. In addition, we drew matrix elements (transition probabilities) at random using various statistical distributions: beta, truncated-gamma, truncated-normal, triangular, uniform, or discontinuous/observed. Recruitment rates were held constant at their observed mean values. Two methods of constraining stage-specific survival to less than or equal to100% were also compared. Different methods of incorporating stochasticity and constraining matrix column sums interacted in their effects and resulted in different estimates of stochastic growth rate (differing by up to 16%). Modelers should be aware that when constraining stage-specific survival to 100%, different methods may introduce different levels of bias in transition element means, and when this happens, different distributions for generating random transition elements may result in different viability estimates. There was no species effect on the results and the growth rates derived from all methods were highly correlated with one another. We conclude that the absolute value of population viability estimates is sensitive to model assumptions, but the relative ranking of populations (and management treatments) is robust. Furthermore, these results are applicable to a range of perennial plants and possibly other life histories.

AB Vascular plants are generally assumed to have no photosynthetic activity under the snow because of the severity of the subnivean environment. In the arctic tundra, snow cover persists into the spring after air temperatures and light increase to levels suitable for photosynthesis of vascular plants in the absence of snow cover. We found significant photosynthetic activity in four arctic evergreen species under springtime snow. This activity was facilitated by favorable conditions in the subnivean environment, where CO2 concentrations are elevated, temperatures are often above freezing, and light levels are sufficient to drive photosynthesis. Diurnal changes in CO2 concentration under the snow and light responses of snow-covered ecosystem CO2 fluxes provide supporting evidence of carbon gain at the ecosystem level. This activity allows evergreens to rapidly increase photosynthesis upon snowmelt and reduces wintertime losses of carbon from arctic ecosystems. The loss of these species under predicted scenarios of climate change could have serious implications for tundra carbon balance, potentially increasing carbon losses.

AB The response of tropical forest carbon balance to global change is highly dependent on the factors limiting net primary productivity (NPP) in this biome. Current empirical global NPP-climate relationships predict that the response of NPP to climate diminishes at higher levels of mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT), but data have been relatively scarce in warm and wet tropical ecosystems. By integrating data from a new comprehensive global survey of NPP from tropical forests and a climate gradient from Maui, Hawaii, along with data previously used to develop NPP-climate relationships, I show that there is a strong negative relationship between MAP and NPP in humid ecosystems. The relationships derived here clearly demonstrate that NPP in wet tropical forests is sensitive to climate, and that future forest growth may be limited by increased precipitation forecast by global climate models for the wet tropics.

AB The classical (Levins) metapopulation scenario envisions a species persisting in a network of habitat patches through a balance between frequent local (within-patch) extinctions and recolonizations. Although this is the dominant paradigm for species in fragmented habitats, empirical support is limited, and it has been argued that very restrictive conditions on migration rates are required: high enough for recolonization to balance extinctions, but low enough that local populations do not fluctuate in synchrony. Through simulation and analysis of a stochastic spatial model, we argue that the likelihood of persistence via the classical scenario is strongly affected by some basic properties of within-patch successional dynamics whose importance has riot been emphasized in metapopulation theory: the distribution of successional stage durations, and whether patches are "refractory" vs. immediately available for recolonization after an extinction has occurred. These properties are tied to the biological causes of extinction (e.g., demographic accident vs. regular successional changes) and patch recovery (e.g., recolonization by a host species vs. regeneration of an exhausted resource base). Our results indicate that metapopulation theory needs to incorporate the patch-dynamics perspective of a landscape in a dynamic mosaic of successional states, with particular attention to links between colonization-exfinction processes and local succession.

AB We propose that the relationship between diversity and community invasibility depends on the degree to which community composition is driven by immigration processes. When immigration is enhanced by high propagule pressure or low-intensity disturbance, the relationship between diversity and exotic species invasion should be positive. Only when such immigration processes are limited should competitive interactions lead to a negative correlation between diversity and invasibility. Moreover, competition should be more apparent at smaller scales where individual plants compete directly for space; thus, diversity and invasibility are more likely to be negatively correlated at small spatial scales. We tested these predictions by comparing exotic and native species diversity of vascular plants across five spatial scales in riparian and upland plant communities in the southern Appalachians, We found a positive relationship between species diversity and exotic invasion in riparian areas at large scales (100 m(2)). Which graded into a negative relationship at small scales (0.01 m(2)). In uplands, there was a slight positive relationship between native and exotic species diversity at both scales of observation. Overall, riparian areas had more exotic and native species than upland areas, and both native and exotic species diversity increased with flood frequency within the riparian zone.

AB The time interval between stand-replacing fires can influence patterns of initial postfire succession if the abundance of postfire propagules varies with prefire stand age. We examined the effect of fire interval on initial postfire lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm.) density in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) following the 1988 fires. We asked whether postfire propagule abundance, measured as prefire percent serotiny, varied with fire interval and could explain patterns in postfire succession. The response of lodgepole pine density to variation in fire interval was explained by spatial and temporal variation in prefire serotiny. At low elevations, postfire lodgepole pine recruitment correlated strongly with prefire percent serotiny, which varied nonlinearly with prefire stand age: As a result, postfire lodgepole pine densities varied nonlinearly with fire interval. In contrast, at high elevations serotiny was low, varied little with stand age and did not influence postfire lodgepole pine densities, although, fire interval was still a significant predictor of postfire densities. At high elevations, fire interval varied nonlinearly with postfire lodgepole densities, presumably due to the temporal variation in propagule abundance from open cones in adjacent unburned stands. Temporal variation in stand-level serotiny at low elevations was best explained by age of individual trees. Logistic regression indicated that trees expected to be serotinous had a low probability of exhibiting serotiny at a young age, with increasing probability as trees matured no to 140 yr. This increase in serotiny with tree age likely accounts for the initial increase in stand-level percent serotiny with stand age at low elevations. The spatial variation in serotiny was correlated with variation in historical fire regimes., Fire interval models derived from lower elevations in YNP indicate that fire occurred historically at 135-185-yr intervals, whereas at higher elevations fires occurred at 280-310-yr intervals. The spatial patterns of serotiny appear to have been influenced by variability in historical fire regimes across the Yellowstone landscape, which has conditioned contemporary successional responses to disturbance.

AB Omnivory is a frequent feeding strategy in terrestrial arthropods, occurring across a diversity of taxa occupying a wide array of habitats. Because omnivory has important consequences for broad areas of theoretical and applied ecology, it is essential to understand those factors that favor its occurrence. Here we address the limiting role of nitrogen in promoting omnivory, not so much from the historical perspective of herbivores supplementing their nutrient-poor plant diet, but by extending the argument to higher trophic levels where predators feed on each other as well as herbivores. Drawing on the historically documented mismatch in, nitrogen stoichiometry between herbivores and their host plants (C:N(plants)much greater than C:N-herbivores), and a recently documented, though smaller, difference in nitrogen content between predators and their herbivore prey (C:N-herbivores > C:N-predators), we discuss the existence of a trade-off between nutrient quality and quantity that occurs across trophic levels. The existence of this trade-off suggests that arthropod predators, which we show to be frequently nitrogen-limited in nature, can enhance their nitrogen intake by broadening their diet to include nitrogen-rich predators. We conclude by outlining the consequences of this trade-off for the relative balance between dietary specialization and supplementation among consumers, emphasizing the divergent roles that large vs. small stoichiometric mismatches may have had for the evolution of omnivory.

AB In 1960, N. G. Hairston, F. E. Smith, and L. B. Slobodkin proposed that terrestrial ecosystems are composed of three trophic levels: predators, herbivores, and plants. Under this model, predators act in a predictable manner to suppress herbivore populations, freeing plant populations from the strong effects of herbivory. However, empirical work has recently demonstrated that many predators exhibit trophic-level omnivory, consuming both herbivores and other predators. This creates a problem for terrestrial ecologists: predator function is indeterminate, because predators may operate from either the third trophic level ("intermediate predators") or the fourth trophic level ("omnivorous top predators") and have opposite effects on herbivore and plant populations. Here we attempt to use a basic understanding of the foraging behavior of predators and their prey to make predictions about predator function. A simulation model produces four predictions: (1) actively foraging predators may be effective regulators of sedentary herbivore populations; (2) sit-and-wait predators are unlikely to suppress populations of sedentary herbivores, but may act as omnivorous top predators, suppressing populations of widely foraging intermediate predators and thereby increasing herbivore densities; (3) among widely foraging predators attacking a common herbivore prey, predators that are large relative to the body size of their prey will be more mobile, and therefore more vulnerable to predation by sit-and-wait omnivores, compared to predators that are similar in size to their prey; and (4) widely foraging omnivores, unlike sit-and-wait omnivores, are unlikely to disrupt herbivore population suppression generated by intermediate predators, and may instead enhance herbivore suppression. These predictions appear to explain the results of several experimental studies of the function of predatory arthropods in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB The relative effects of and interactions between, bottom-up and top-down processes are fundamental to,population and community structure in both terrestrial and marine systems. These issues are especially critical for seaweed populations on coral reefs, since both bottom-up and top-down factors are suggested as causes of algal invasions during reef degradation. Although algal invasions require the establishment of new recruits, most previous studies of tropical. marine algae have focused on mature stages. We simultaneously manipulated nutrient supply to and herbivory on recruits of two ecologically different species of seaweed on the Great Barrier Reef. We found that herbivory strongly reduced both density and growth of recruits for both species, whereas nutrient supply had minor effects on growth of Lobophora variegata recruits and no detectable effects on Sargassum fissifolium recruits. Notwithstanding the dominance of herbivory. over nutrient effects, herbivory Was not uniform, but varied both between species and among response variables (density and size), and was apparently stronger for nutrient-enriched plants. Our data demonstrate that the relative importance of bottom-up and top-down processes may depend on the species, circumstances, and life-history processes under consideration. These results also emphasize the importance of herbivores to the protection of coral reefs against algal overgrowth.

AB Leaf-cutting ants (Atta spp.) often increase in abundance following deforestation and may have an important effect on forest succession on abandoned land. In this study, we evaluated the effects of leaf-cutting ant (Atta sexdens) activity on physical and chemical properties of soil, root distribution, and tree growth in a 17-yr-old secondary forest in eastern Amazonia, Brazil. We compared the soil properties and root distribution in shafts excavated into five mature nests and at 15 m distanced from each nest mound. We evaluated the nest effects on vegetation measuring the stem diameter growth of nine tree species and predawn leaf water potential of the tree species, Banara guianensis, along a gradient of increasing distance from the nest mounds. The growth of seedlings (Cecropia sp.) in pots containing different proportions of mineral soil and organic matter removed from nest refuse chambers was also compared. The deep soil beneath A. sexdens nests at different depths (100, 200, and 300 cm) presented a low (fivefold, P < 0.01) resistance to penetration and was rich in Ca (three- to fourfold, P = 0.06-0.02), K (7-14-fold, P < 0.05), and Mg (two- to threefold, P = 0.09 for 200 cm depth) when compared to non-nest soil. These changes in nest soil properties were accompanied by increases in coarse root biomass (>2 mm diameter, three- to fourfold) and fine root biomass (<2 mm, 10-50 fold). However, stem diameter growth was generally not affected by distance from the nest. The growth of Cecropia sp. seedlings in a pot experiment was favored by the addition of organic matter from the refuse chambers. Banara guianensis trees experienced greater water stress (low predawn water potential) close to the nest mound, perhaps indicating increased competition for soil water that may have accompanied the proliferation of roots of several species in the nest. The competing Atta effects of defoliation vs. deep soil tillage and nutrient enrichment upon secondary forest growth are difficult to compare. Atta's modification of soil physical and chemical properties point to its potential role in facilitating the rapid recovery of deep root systems and soil water uptake previously observed in this secondary forest.

AB Population cycles have been remarkably resistant to explanation, in part because crucial experiments are rarely possible on appropriate spatial and temporal scales. Here we show how new approaches to nonlinear time-series analysis can distinguish between competing hypotheses for population cycles of larch budmoth in the Swiss Alps: delayed effects of budmoth density on food quality, and budmoth-parasitoid interactions. We re-examined data on budmoth density, plant quality, and parasitism rates. Our results suggest that the effect of plant quality on budmoth density is weak. By contrast, a simple model of budmoth-parasitoid interaction accounts for 90% of the variance in budmoth population growth rates. Thus, contrary to previous studies, we find that parasitoid-budmoth interaction appears to be the dominant factor driving the budmoth cycle.

AB By creating or modifying habitats used by other organisms, physical ecosystem engineers can influence local patterns of biological diversity. However, there have been very few empirical studies quantifying engineering effects in different biological systems. In this study, we examined the effect of shelter-building caterpillars on the species richness and guild structure of leaf-chewing herbivores occupying individual white oak (Quercus alba) saplings. For each of two years, we disrupted leaf-tie formation on 93 white oak saplings during a three-week period in early summer that coincided with the peak in leaf-tie construction by the most common leaf-tying caterpillar, Pseudotelphusa sp. (Gelechiidae). We then created artificial leaf ties on 62 of these saplings by clipping together adjacent pairs. of leaves (10% of the foliage) on each tree. For 31 of these trees, we also placed a single Pseudotelphusa caterpillar into each artificial tie to examine possible non-engineering effects associated with the caterpillar in addition to its shelter-building activity. One month later, removal of leaf ties had reduced the average density of leaf ties present on a tree by 61% (1999) and 54% (2000). This effect persisted throughout the season, indicating that no species assumed the engineering role of Pseudotelphusa sp. once it was removed. The decrease in shelter availability significantly decreased mean cumulative species richness of leaf-chewing insects by 38% (1999) and 14% (2000) compared to the two artificial tie treatments (with and without caterpillars initially), which did not differ from one another. Herbivore community composition also differed significantly between the removal and artificial tie treatments in both years, due to increased species richness of leaf-tying caterpillars (1999 and 2000), sawflies (1999 only), and beetles (2000 only) on trees with artificial ties. By creating leaf shelters early in the season, Pseudotelphusa sp. caterpillars have large and persistent effects on seasonal patterns of herbivore recruitment to and/or retention by white oak trees.

AB In response to mast production of acorns, populations of small mammals, such as the white-footed mouse and eastern chipmunk, greatly increase and, in turn, initiate cascades of direct and indirect effects that permeate throughout forest communities. To examine the strength of the effects stemming from acorn crops, we conducted studies in oak-dominated deciduous forest of the Hudson Valley, New York, documenting the connections between predator abundance (small mammals,and raptors) and the abundance and reproductive success of five woodland songbirds. Nest predation rates increased at high rodent densities for Veeries, Red-eyed Vireos, and Wood Thrushes. Analysis of Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data from surrounding counties demonstrated a unimodal relationship between rodent density (year t) and songbird abundance (year t + 1), rather than a monotonic decline. Regional Christmas Bird Count data for Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks showed a positive correlation between rodent density and accipiter abundance the following winter, suggesting that hawks exhibit A numerical response to rodents. Taken together, we suggest that predation by accipiters when rodents are scarce, in combination with high nest predation when rodents are abundant, may explain the unimodal relationship between rodents and Songbirds. Nonlinear relationships between predator and prey abundance and indirect interactions appear to characterize this system.

AB Plant community structure is often the result of interactions between succession, disturbance, and dispersal. While some disturbances may be highly stochastic (e.g., flooding or landslides), other types of disturbance are closely linked to the current successional state of the community (e.g., fire or herbivory). For example, when herbivores preferentially feed on early successional species they may generate conditions favorable for these species and thus create a positive feedback. Positive feedbacks may create multiple stable equilibria within plant communities. We demonstrate the presence of these positive feedbacks using experiments conducted in a restored California grassland. We found that pocket gophers (Thomomys bottae) preferentially forage in areas dominated by annual species, and gopher foraging activity increases the abundance of annual plants. We use a Markov chain model to identify how the foraging behavior, dispersal behavior, and population dynamics of territorial herbivores can structure a plant community across multiple spatial-scales. The model is loosely based on the biology of pocket gophers, though it is general enough to be applicable to other territorial herbivores with foraging preferences. We find that a foraging preference for early successional species can generate multiple plant communities that persist within a herbivore's territory. If juveniles are selective when searching for territories during their dispersal phase, then herbivores can also generate persistent and distinct plant communities over larger spatial scales. In this case, fixed regions of the landscape. may become occupied by herbivores for long periods (many herbivore generations) and be composed of a range of successional plant species, whereas the remaining landscape is abandoned by herbivores and becomes dominated by late successional species. This structuring of the landscape occurs even though we assume that the entire landscape is intrinsically identical.

AB Vector-borne parasites are commonly predicted to be less virulent to the vector than to the definitive host as the parasite gains little by harming its main route of transmission. Here we assess the empirical evidence from systems in which insects are vectors for vertebrate, plant, and invertebrate parasites. The body of evidence supports lower (but nonzero) parasite virulence to vectors than to plant or invertebrate hosts, but not to vertebrate hosts. We consider why this might be by assessing evolutionarily stable strategies for an insect parasite that can infect both predator and prey (or vector and definitive host) and can have distinct virulences in these two potential hosts. In a homogeneous environment, the parasite is predicted to be equally virulent to predator and prey. However, in a patchy environment it is predicted to become benign toward the more mobile of the two potential hosts, provided interpatch movement of free parasites is low and competitive displacement among strains in a patch is weak. This prediction meets reality in that the vector is usually more mobile between patches than is the definitive host in plant and invertebrate systems, but not necessarily in vertebrate hosts.

AB Periodic hydrological connectivity among fragmented floodplain habitats governs the persistence of aquatic biota. In dryland rivers, unpredictable flooding interspersed with low flows and drying drive their "boom and bust" ecology. During drying, aquatic habitats contract and fragment. Flooding connects and expands habitats, triggering productivity booms in waterbirds, fish, and plants. Microinvertebrates form the base of the food web and also flourish after floods, but their colonization pathways remain unknown. To determine the relative contribution of flood water-transported propagules vs. emergence of in situ resting stages from inundated sediments, we studied short-term recruitment of microinvertebrates after flooding in the dryland Darling River, Australia. Lakes open to transported and emerging in situ micro invertebrates were compared with lake and laboratory microcosms closed to transported microinvertebrates. Floods imported most early colonists to floodplain lakes. In situ emergence from sediments was less important until weeks later but potentially sustained production over a longer period of inundation. Some taxa primarily colonized lakes via emergence whereas others were only transported to lakes. A spatially nested ANOVA approach spanning patches within lakes to among reaches revealed contrasting variability across hierarchical scales for taxonomic richness and densities of microinvertebrate taxa. This was most marked at the reach scale, possibly reflecting seasonal patterns in flooding. Microinvertebrate colonization sequences in the Darling River floodplain rely on connectivity between habitats during flooding. Ecological connectivity was greater at small spatial scales (patches within lakes 100-1000 m, among lakes 10(4)-10(5) m) than at larger spatial scales (reaches 10(5)-10(6) m). The strength of connectivity is likely to vary across spatial scales with the magnitude, duration, and rate of rise and fall of floods.

AB High variability in plant-growth response to the presence of different mycorrhizal fungi can be a major determinant of local plant species diversity. Multiple species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can coexist in terrestrial ecosystems, and co-occurring plants can differ in their response to colonization by these different fungi. However, the range of mycorrhizal plant-growth responses that can occur within communities has not been determined. In the present study, I crossed a large number of plant and fungal species that co-occur to determine the range of responses that can exist within an ecosystem. I also crossed exotic fungal isolates vs. local plant isolates and local fungal isolates vs. exotic plant isolates to determine whether the range of plant growth responses differs when using foreign genotypes. The data indicate that plant growth responses to mycorrhizal inoculation within an ecosystem can range from highly parasitic to highly mutualistic. In this study, the direction and magnitude of the response depended on the combination of plant and fungal species. No plant did best with the same fungal isolate. The range of responses was greatest when using local plants and fungi. Whereas parasitic and mutualistic responses were also detected when using foreign plant or fungal genotypes, the range of responses was significantly reduced, as was the relative frequency of positive responses. Overall, this study suggests that, within ecosystems, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can function along a continuum from parasitism to mutualism, and that extreme responses are more common when using locally adapted plants and fungi. This high variation in plant growth response may be a large contributor to plant species coexistence and the structure of plant communities.

AB Range boundaries are a fundamental expression of a species' relationship with other species and with the abiotic environment. In this study, I examined the roles of biotic and abiotic factors in setting the local range limits of Mazzaella parksii (formerly Mazzaella cornucopiae). In Washington State, this turf-forming red alga occurs almost exclusively in a discrete high intertidal band on north-facing, wave-exposed shores. I investigated the mechanisms underlying these distributional patterns via a series of intra- and extra-limital transplant experiments coupled with manipulations of interacting species and abiotic stress. The upper limit of Mazzaella was set by physiological stress; turfs,transplanted above the natural Mazzaella zone bleached and died over the course of a few months. Mazzaella's lower limit was set by herbivory; turfs transplanted below the natural zone were consumed in treatments accessible to grazers but thrived in herbivore-exclusion plots. South-facing transplants at the same intertidal height as the natural north-facing Mazzaella zone declined regardless of interspecific interactions, indicating that Mazzaella's upper limit is lower on south-facing shores. However, the position of the herbivore-determined lower limit was similar between aspects. South-facing transplants could survive below the natural Mazzaella zone if the grazer-determined lower limit was extended downshore by herbivore exclusions or at Mazzaella's natural intertidal height (i.e.; the height at which it persists on north-facing surfaces) if the physiologically determined upper limit was extended upshore by experimental shades. In the absence of such experimental modifications, Mazzaella was effectively excluded from south-facing shores because its upper limit had converged on its lower limit. Thus, abiotic factors and biological factors interact to set the horizontal distributional limits of this alga. This conceptual model is consistent with Ma7zaella's distribution at a variety of spatial scales and has broad implications for both spatial patterns and temporal trends in the distribution and abundance of species.

AB One of the most popular approaches for maintaining populations and conserving biodiversity in fragmented landscapes is to retain or create corridors that connect otherwise isolated habitat patches. Working in large-scale, experimental landscapes in which open-habitat patches and corridors were created by harvesting pine forest, we showed that corridors direct movements of different types of species, including butterflies, small mammals, and bird-dispersed plants, causing higher movement between connected than between unconnected patches. Corridors directed the movement of all 10 species studied, with all corridor effect sizes >68%. However, this corridor effect was significant for five species, not significant for one species, and inconclusive for four species because of small sample sizes. Although we found no evidence that corridors increase emigration from a patch, our results show that movements of disparate taxa with broadly different life histories and functional roles are directed by corridors.

Without flowers, Mead's milkweed (Asclepias meadii) is an unobtrusive prairie plant, and most plants flower irregularly. We used maximum likelihood to estimate probabilities of survival and detection for milkweeds in annual censuses during 1992-1999. Initially, we assumed no recruitment and fit models to all data and to flowering plants only. Because plants were marked when located, probabilities of resighting exceeded those of initial discovery. Plants were most likely to flower and be detected in years when the prairie was burned. We marked 177 plants in eight years but estimated the 1992 population to be 337 or 191 plants with 166 or 121 surviving to 1999, depending on the data set. Thus, estimated population size exceeded number of plants seen. Estimated annual survival probability was generally greater than or equal to0.95, but aggregate survival over eight years predicted rapid extinction without recruitment. When we included recruitment, estimates of survival changed little, and estimated population size varied between 118 and 147 individuals. Discovery of new plants in two additional years (2000 and 2001) appeared to be consistent with required recruitment, but simple counts of these plants did not track population trends.

AB The long-term role of fire in coastal temperate rain forest is poorly understood. To determine the historical role of fire on western Vancouver Island (British Columbia, Canada), we constructed a long-term spatially explicit fire history and examined the spatial and temporal distribution of fire during the Holocene. Two fire-history parameters (time-since-fire [TSF] and fire extent) were related to three landscape parameters landform [hill slope or terrace]. aspect, and forest composition) at 83 sites in a 730-ha low-elevation (less than similar to200 m) area of a mountainous watershed. We dated fires using tree rings ( 18 sites) and 120 soil-charcoal radiocarbon dates (65 sites). Comparisons among multiple radiocarbon dates indicated a high probability that the charcoal dated at each site represented the most recent fire, though we expect greater error in TSF estimates at sites where charcoal was very old (>6000 yr) and was restricted to mineral soil horizons. TSF estimates ranged from 64 to similar to12 220 yr; 45% of the sites have burned in the last 1000 yr, whereas 2017( of the sites have not burned for over 6000 yr. Differences in median TSF were more significant between landform types or across aspects than among forest types, Median TSF was significantly greater on terraces (4410 yr) than on hill slopes (740 yr). On hill slopes. all south-facing and southwest-facing sites have burned within the last 1000 yr compared to only 27% of north- and east-facing sites burning over the same period. Comparison of fire dates among neighboring sites indicated that fires rarely extended >250 m. During the late Holocene, landform controls have been strong. resulting in the bias of fires to south-facing hillslopes and thus allowing late-successional forest structure to persist for thousands of years in a large portion of the watershed. In contrast, the early Holocene regional climate and forest composition likely resulted in larger landscape tires that were not strongly controlled by landform factors. The millennial-scale TSF detected in this study supports the distinction of coastal temperate rain forest as being under a fundamentally different disturbance regime than other Pacific Northwest forests to the cast and south.

AB Ecological studies often require studying the common structure of a pair of data tables. Co-inertia analysis is a multivariate method for coupling two tables. It is often neglected,by ecologists who prefer the widely used methods of redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis. We present the co-inertia criterion for measuring the adequacy between two data sets. Co-inertia analysis is based on this criterion as are canonical correspondence analysis or canonical correlation analysis, but the latter two have additional constraints. Co-inertia analysis is very flexible and allows many possibilities for coupling. Co-inertia analysis is suitable for quantitative and/or qualitative or fuzzy environmental variables. Moreover, various weighting of sites and various transformations and/or centering of species data are available for this method. Hence, more ecological considerations can be taken into account in the statistical procedures. Moreover, the principle of this method is very general and can be easily extended to the case of distance matrices or to the case of more than two tables. Simulated ecological data are used to compare the co-inertia approach with other available methods.

AB Mutualisms form an integral part of many communities and play an important role in the maintenance and promotion of biodiversity. The inherent conflict of interest between mutualists suggests that partners should reduce the cost of the interaction whenever possible. As a result, defense mechanisms may evolve to prevent overexploitation by both partners. Selection for the evolution of defenses intrinsic to the interaction may be unnecessary, however, under particular ecological conditions. I examined the interaction between the pollinating yucca moth Tegeticula cassandra and its host plant Yucca filamentosa to determine whether extrinsic factors are important in promoting stability in this mutualism. Yuccas can selectively abscise fruit with high egg loads for moth species that damage ovules during oviposition into the locule. Female T. cassandra, however, lay eggs less than a millimeter beneath the tissue surface and fail to damage ovules, circumventing this mechanism of selective abscission. Consequently, yuccas are unable to regulate egg loads by T. cassandra, and moths are free to lay many eggs. Despite this, only 5-11% of T. cassandra eggs survive to exit the fruit as mature larvae. I tested the hypothesis that T. cassandra survivorship is regulated by the extrinsic factors dehydration and predation. While exclusion of potential predators seemed to have no effect on survivorship, moth eggs in flowers with experimentally increased vapor pressure had significantly greater survivorship compared to controls. Survivorship of a closely related locule-ovipositing species was unaffected by either predator exclusion or changes in vapor pressure. The results suggest that the stability of mutualisms can depend at least in part on extrinsic factors.

AB The evolution of flowering time can be influenced directly by pollinators and indirectly by seed dispersers. In temperate latitudes, interactions with climate, especially temperature, may affect both plants and their animal mutualists. Winter-flowering plants allow assessment of biotic influences on the evolution of flowering time because temperature is unlikely to select directly for this uncommon reproductive behavior. In northwestern Patagonia, the hemiparasitic mistletoe Tristerix corymbosus flowers from early fall, through the cool winter, to late spring. This species is pollinated by the hummingbird Sephanoides galeritus, and its seeds are dispersed by the marsupial Dromiciops australis. In two populations during two years, I analyzed seasonal variation in pollination, fruit production, and fruit removal. Hummingbird visitation was lowest in winter and late spring, and flowers opening during those periods showed reduced pollination and fruit set, partly due to pollinator limitation, compared to flowers that opened during fall or early spring. Fruits that ripened during summer (January-March) had a higher chance of being removed than fruits ripening during either spring or fall, due to their overlap with the period of maximum disperser activity. Timing of flower opening was strongly associated with fruit maturation time and with fruit removal rates. Thus, even though flowers that opened during winter exhibited only moderate fruit production, their fruits benefited from high fruit removal and seed dispersal in mid to late summer. These results suggest that the activity period of this plant's disperser, in combination with a lack of strong pollination constraints, probably governed the evolution of flowering phenology in this mistletoe. However, the proximate influence of temperature on flower and fruit development may prevent a fine-tuned match between flowering phenology and the period of maximum mutualist activity.

AB Planktonic cercariae (parasite larvae) of digenetic flatworms (Himasthla rhigedana) encyst up to 100% of intermediate host populations. Toward explaining such high prevalence, larval behavior and passive-transport processes were evaluated experimentally for their roles in waterborne parasite transmission. Using a new application of laser and digital video imaging technologies, we quantified cercarial movements in still water and in simulated field flows. In still water, downward swimming in response to light,irrespective of intensity or source, and gravity brought larvae to the bottom three-times faster than gravitational sinking alone. A 33% elevation in temperature (18-24degreesC) caused a 71% increase in swim speed. In flume flows characteristic of southern California salt marshes (u(*) =. 0.2 cm/s, occurring >80% of the time), vertical larval distributions were highly bottom skewed. The mean downward swim speed (0.59 cm/s at 24degreesC) was three times faster than turbulent fluctuations (w' = 0.23 cm/s), indicating that cercariae overpowered eddies to reach the bed. When flume flows simulated rare storm events (u(*) = 0.8 cm/s, w' = 0.95 cm/s, occurring less than or equal to1% of the time), turbulence overwhelmed behavioral effects and homogeneously mixed larvae throughout the water column. Environmentally triggered, downward swimming can thus quickly bring larvae to the bed, promoting contact with benthic intermediate hosts (snails and crabs) under most flow conditions. The efficacy,of vertical swimming in typical marsh flows identifies larval behavior, not passive transport, as the principal mechanism responsible for dispersal to host habitat.

AB Dispersal among spatially subdivided populations and variability in local habitat patch quality can strongly affect local and regional population dynamics. A meta-population of mayflies (Callibaetis ferrugineus hageni) was studied in which larvae developed in beaver ponds and emerged to the terrestrial habitat as adults; adult females had the potential to disperse among ponds before oviposition. Ponds (patches) differed in the presence or absence of trout. Densities of late instar larvae were more than an order of magnitude greater in fishless ponds.
   Estimates of adult production, migration, and oviposition rate were used to determine whether the difference in larval abundance between pond types was more consistent with a source-sink or balanced dispersal model. Patch quality among ponds (estimated by the emergence rate of adults) varied from 0 to similar to3900 individuals.m(-2).yr(-1), and was significantly lower in ponds with trout. Survivorship of adult females in the regional terrestrial habitat was low (1.7%). Consistent with the predictions of source-sink theory, local recruitment to the next generation was not related to local emergence. Moreover, comparison of emergence and recruitment revealed that some ponds were net exporters of females (sources) and others were net importers (sinks). Ovipositing females did not avoid ovipositing in ponds with trout. Overall, the data were consistent with a source-sink dynamic because patches differed in quality, and because there was net migration of individuals from sources to sinks. The results support the hypothesis that local and regional population dynamics are influenced by spatial variation in patch quality, and by the ability of individuals to both disperse among and assess the quality of habitat patches.

AB Most soil organic matter (SOM) derives from plant material, but there are substantial gaps in our understanding of its transformation mechanisms. Alterations that occur as SOM decays and is stabilized have proved difficult to study owing largely to its diverse initial chemical composition and stable isotope values. We examined SOM stable isotope ratios in relation to composition using solid-state C-13 Cross Polarization Magic Angle Spin (CPMAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in sequentially deeper organic and mineral horizon soil samples collected from an unpolluted ecosystem in southeast Alaska, USA, dominated by C-3 vegetation. We found that, as humified carbon (C not respired as CO, during decomposition) increased in aliphaticity (ratio of unsubstituted aliphatics to carbohydrates), it also increased in N-15 but showed no clear trend in C-13. These results imply that humification (and the concomitant stabilization of soil C) at our site resulted from microbial alteration of organics rather than from accumulation of recalcitrant compounds. The strong, and previously unreported, relation between N-15 and SOM composition found at our study site suggests that degree of SOM humification may be correlated with an increase in delta(15)N SOM values relative to delta(15)N for fresh litter and other source material.

AB Traits associated with plant tolerance to herbivory are often thought to be those involved in resource acquisition, e.g., root biomass, leaf area, and photosynthetic rate. Plant resistance traits, like concentrations of secondary compounds, can also be negatively associated with tolerance. Few studies have,measured both "tolerance" and "resistance" traits in the same study to determine which are the best predictors of a plant's ability to tolerate insect,damage. Here, we measured simultaneously a large suite of traits on damaged and undamaged siblings in 10 families of greenhouse-grown Raphanus raphanistrum plants. Traits measured were: leaf area, root biomass, shoot biomass, photosynthetic rate, trichome density, total glucosinolate concentration, flowering rate, petal size, total number of flowers, and total number of seeds. Pieris rapae larvae were used to damage plants to 50% leaf area removal. Using multiple regression, we examined which traits were the best. predictors of tolerance. We considered both male tolerance (relative number of flowers produced by damaged and undamaged sibs) and female tolerance (relative number of seeds produced). We found that, generally, resistance traits were better predictors of both male and female tolerance than tolerance traits. Interestingly, we found that mate and female tolerance were not correlated, and that male tolerance was significantly less variable than female tolerance. We also found that measurements, of traits postdamage (induced state) were more informative than measurements on undamaged plants (constitutive state). Our results support the idea of a resistance/tolerance trade-off. In addition, our study suggests that there are conflicts in investment in male. vs. female fitness after damage.

We determined the role of life history and predation in maintaining this striking pattern by conducting a series of transplant experiments in the field and a laboratory experiment manipulating presence and absence of local predators. Life history (1) shaped the ability of species to cope with drying regime, thereby excluding temporary-pond Lestes from vernal ponds and permanent-water Lestes from temporary ponds, and (2) generated size differences among species due to differences in the timing of hatching. This mediated the exclusion of temporary-pond Lestes from permanent water bodies through asymmetric intraguild predation by permanent-water Lestes. Dragonfly predation on permanent-water Lestes had an indirect positive effect on the survival of temporary-pond Lestes; however, this effect apparently is too small to allow coexistence of both Lestes groups. Predation by large dragonfly larvae excluded the Lestes species of vernal ponds from temporary ponds, and differential vulnerability to large dragonfly larvae and fish shaped the reciprocal dominance of L. eurinus and L. vigilax in fishless and fish-containing permanent water bodies, respectively. Taken together, these results show that life history constraints and predation both shape the distributions of Lestes species along the pond permanence gradient in New England. We discuss the importance of this freshwater habitat gradient in shaping local and regional species diversity.

AB The transition to piscivory is a crucial ontogenetic niche shift for many primarily piscivorous fishes. An early transition to piscivory may increase growth, decrease mortality, and therefore enhance lifetime fitness. Although much is known about the extent and causes of variation in the timing of the shift to piscivory among species and among cohorts within a species, little is known about the extent and causes of variation in the timing of the switch to piscivory among individuals within a single cohort. Here, I link otolith age and growth analysis to direct diet and stable isotope analyses to examine variation in the timing of the transition to piscivory and its causes among individual members of the 1994 largemouth bass cohort in Paul Lake, Michigan. Stable isotope and direct diet analyses indicate that only a few members of the 1994 cohort were able to shift to and sustain piscivory in their first summer of life (early piscivores), while most cohort members would have to wait until their second summer of life to become piscivorous (late piscivores).. Significant differences in growth rate between early and late piscivores emerged shortly after 18 June, the first date of possible piscivory by early piscivores, after which early piscivores began to grow at rates nearly twice that of late piscivores. Otolith and stable isotope analyses combined indicate that an early hatching date was necessary, but not sufficient, to explain variation in the timing of the transition to piscivory. All early piscivores were hatched early in the summer, but many early-hatched members of the 1994 cohort did not shift to piscivory in their first summer of life. A combination of at least 10 days of variation in hatching dates and higher-than-average growth rates was required for early piscivores to switch to and sustain piscivory in their first summer of life. Individuals that were able to make the early transition to piscivory most likely benefited from both increased survival and fecundity over much of their life, the combination of which would confer a substantial fitness advantage upon individuals able to make the early transition to piscivory.

AB Volatile organic compounds emitted by plants have long been recognized as having important influences on tropospheric chemistry, most notably in contributing to the production of tropospheric ozone and aerosols. One such compound, methylbutenol (MBO), was recently identified as a major component of the volatiles emitted by ponderosa pine and several other species of pine in western North America. On short time scales, MBO emissions increase with light intensity in parallel with photosynthetic responses, but emissions and photosynthesis show opposite responses to increases in temperature. We investigate the response of MBO emission to water stress, ambient temperature, and the aging of needles in field grown Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine). Photosynthetic rates and MBO production capacities of P. ponderosa were measured over the course of a season on saplings at a site that experienced summer drought and at a site that received supplementary water. In addition, a water-stress alleviation experiment was performed in which drought-stressed P. ponderosa seedlings were re-watered at the end of the season and pre-/post-alleviation photosynthetic rates and MBO production capacities were compared. Over the season photosynthesis declined while MBO production capacity tracked changes in ambient temperature linearly both over the entire season and on a day-to-day basis. Although severe water stress reduced photosynthetic rates, there was no difference in the response of MBO production capacity to ambient temperature under either drought-stressed or well-watered conditions, and there was no change in MBO production capacity following water stress alleviation. MBO emission declined with needle age. The correlation between MBO production capacity and ambient temperature is consistent with the view that MBO may provide a protection against high temperature stress similar to that suggested for isoprene.

AB We explored the relative importance of temporal vs. spatial variability to the conditionality of a mutualism between the treehopper Publilia modesta and the ant Formica obscuripes. The effect of the ants on the membracids varied considerably among years. When the effect of the ants on the membracids was estimated in five sites spread over 5 km there was mixed evidence for spatial conditionality in the mutualism. Using repeated surveys of nymph number we found that the effect of the ants on nymph number varied among sites through time. When total new adult production was examined, however, no such interaction between ants and location was evident. Aggregations displayed strong negative density-dependent adult production. Thus, while in some sites ants had a greater positive effect on nymph survivorship, aggregations at those sites produced proportionately fewer adults because of negative density dependence. Density dependence reduced or eliminated spatial differences in the effect of the ants-on the membracids. Differences among sites did not explain spatial variation in the effect-of ants on nymphs or new adult production. We conclude that temporal variability is much more important than spatial variability in generating conditionality in the mutualism.

AB Large seeds have been hypothesized to confer survival advantages in the shaded forest, and small seeds to confer growth advantages in open habitats. We explored these hypotheses using experimental studies in both field and controlled conditions. Our experiments examined intraspecific effects of seed mass on seedling demography in eight sympatric woody species of Psychotria. We compared the effects of seed mass on seedling size (biomass), maximum relative growth rate (RGR), the proportion of emerged seedlings that survived until one year of age, and the proportion of Sown seeds reaching the stage of one-year-old seedlings in gaps compared with shaded rain forest habitats, as well as in contrasting greenhouse, light conditions. For each species, seeds were classified into four seed mass categories and introduced to three pairs of shaded forest gap sites. In the greenhouse, emerged seedlings from different seed mass categories were grown in contrasting light environments. A positive effect of seed mass on seedling survival was observed in six of seven species in the shaded forest but only in two species in gaps. Final seedling biomass was positively related to seed mass in five species in the shaded forest, but only in two species in gaps. In some species,RGR decreased with seed mass. Consequently, the biomass achieved by small-seeded seedlings with relatively fast growth rates was similar to that of seedlings derived from large seeds. The probability of recruitment increased with seed mass in four of seven species in the shaded forest, but only in two species in gaps. Negative effects of seed mass on recruitment occurred only in one species, and only in gaps. The positive effects of seed mass on seedling biomass and survival observed under shaded greenhouse conditions were weaker than those observed in the shaded forest. Overall, our results indicate that: (1) seed mass influences recruitment in natural forest habitats, (2) larger seeds confer higher probability of recruitment in the shaded forest by producing seedlings with larger size and higher probability of survival, and (3) in natural habitats ecological factors in addition to light (e.g., seed predators) operated selectively on seedlings emerging from seeds differing in mass.

AB We investigated the proximate environmental cues that influence the timing of reproduction in the seasonally and synchronously breeding Galapagos marine iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus). Marine iguana foraging patterns are closely linked to the tidal cycle, and they feed exclusively on macroalgae. The Galapagos Islands are characterized by seasonal currents that impact water temperature and ultimately algal abundance, which is known to affect iguana body condition and survival. In our study, marine iguanas preferred Gelidium sp., which had the highest nutritional quality (nitrogen content, carbon content, and C:N ratio) of the three species of macroalgae on which they feed. Nutritional quality in Gelidium changed predictably with increasing sea surface temperature, peaking around the median iguana copulation date. Similarly, foraging behavior changed around the time copulations began. To test if consistent relationships existed among food quality, water temperature, and breeding life history, we used seven years of data from this population and found that breeding occurred earlier in years when the mean December sea surface temperature was warmer. Although iguanas might cue directly on changes in sea surface temperature, given the frequency and intensity of El Nino events in the Galapagos, this hypothesis is unlikely. Rather, our results suggest that marine iguanas may use subtle changes in food quality (particularly energy content) associated with seasonal, but annually variable, changes in water temperature as a cue to initiate breeding. The excess available energy may be used to withstand the costly breeding period, as well as to provision Yolk to improve hatchling growth and survival.

AB While the importance of omnivory in community and food web ecology has received recent recognition, the behavioral basis of omnivory has not been thoroughly explored. Here we argue that understanding the basis of food mixing (i.e., eating different food types) and food selection behavior is central to understanding the causes and consequences of omnivory. Despite the existence of several alternative hypotheses, constraints imposed by nutrients are often assumed to explain the function of food mixing by omnivores and herbivores. However, few studies have actually addressed this issue through rigorous tests of multiple hypotheses. To illustrate the importance of non-nutritive factors, we marshal evidence for the roles of toxin dilution, parasite avoidance and resistance, and predation risk in food mixing and food selection by omnivores and polyphagous herbivores. Whether food mixing stabilizes population, community, and food web dynamics is likely to depend on the details of food selection and the spatial and temporal scales of food mixing.

AB Predictive capacity is needed to anticipate the consequences of global change. Along with the computational challenges inherent in accounting for uncertainly in models of ecological and physical processes related to global change, we face educational challenges related to developing the intellectual capital for thinking with uncertainty in mind. Hand in hand with promoting the kinds of research needed to advance the evolving science of ecological forecasting, we need to set an education agenda for developing and enhancing computational literacy of current and future ecologists, managers, and policymakers. Key elements of an educational agenda are (1) defining the audiences and what each needs to know and be able to do; (2) developing curricula and pedagogical strategies in which thinking skills and conceptual understanding are, by design, linked; (3) addressing training needs of faculty to teach effectively about uncertainty to these different audiences; and (4) creating and implementing assessment tools to explore the impact of programs designed to train ecologists to think with uncertainty in mind. Assessing the extent to which new training models have impacted forecasting research and the conceptual understanding of ecologists is an important topic for future scholarship in education, and a natural area for collaboration between forecasting and-education researchers.

AB Recent studies indicate that plant species richness and primary productivity of grasslands may be limited by seed availability. However, it is not known how widespread this limitation is, whether it is affected by disturbance, or which mechanisms underlie any disturbance effect. We tested for seed limitation and explored the role of litter accumulation in explaining effects of recent grazing history on seedling establishment, species diversity (richness and evenness), and plant productivity in a subhumid grassland ecosystem in Texas, USA. We added seeds and removed litter in a factorial treatment arrangement (seeds added, litter removed, seeds added and litter removed, and control [no seeds added nor litter removed]) within each of five fields: currently grazed, no grazing for 1-2, 2-3, or 6-7 yr, and an unplowed prairie remnant. Seeds from each of 20 native species were added to replicated 1-m(2) plots in each field during each of two growing seasons.
   Adding seeds increased seedling emergence in all fields, but this increase was much greater when litter was removed, especially in ungrazed fields. Counter to our expectations, seedling emergence increased with time since grazing when litter was removed and was greatest in fields not grazed for 1-3 yr when litter was present. As expected, light availability at the soil surface decreased with time since grazing. However, soil water availability to 15 cm depth increased with time since grazing, suggesting that limits on seedling emergence changed from water to light with time since grazing.
   Aboveground productivity during the second year of the study was significantly reduced following seed additions in the four fields along the grazing gradient, primarily because of a decrease in the productivity of C-4 grasses. Species diversity decreased with time since grazing. Seed additions slightly increased species richness but decreased species evenness in fields located along the grazing gradient, resulting in no net effect on diversity. In the more species-rich prairie remnant, seediadditions had no effect on aboveground productivity or species richness or evenness. These results suggest that seedling emergence does not relate linearly to time since grazing and that seed availability does not limit productivity and diversity in these subhumid grasslands.

AB We test the idea that species interactions and environmental tolerances translate constrained traits to patterns of species distribution and abundance through a series of trade-offs. First we suggest a framework to classify relationships among traits at different levels of organization. We then synthesize experiments to quantify relationships at these multiple levels for a group of I I prairie plant species that characterize different disturbance regimes. Finally we identify linkages among traits at these different levels and examine how these linkages relate plant traits to patterns of species composition following gap creation.
   Linkages were evident between all levels of response, lending credence to the idea that relationships among organismal traits can shape dynamics of species interactions and thereby translate into abundance patterns. Interestingly the important trade-offs and translators for the set of species we examined were not always the ones predicted by conceptual models. For instance, we found evidence of trade-offs between measures of competitive and tolerance (to soil compaction) abilities, but little evidence of negative correlations between competitive abilities in different environments or between colonization and competitive abilities. Tolerance (to defoliation, shade, drought) and colonization abilities, rather than competitive ability, appeared to be important translators that linked organismal traits to abundance patterns. In addition growth rates of the species under field conditions, but not other measures of demographic success (e.g., survival, seedbank density), were related to the species distributions due to soil disturbance. Although our results support the idea that trade-offs scale across several levels of organization, specific predictions of several well-known hypotheses are not borne out along all levels of organization and other, less emphasized trade-offs appear to be as important in our study system.

AB Social and density-dependent life history processes may differ according to age and the reproductive history of individuals. Arvicoline rodents have a typical, season-dependent, bimodal, age distribution of breeding individuals within a population. This distribution may influence population fluctuations. In this study, we measured effects of interspecific competition from field voles (Microtus agrestis) on various fitness components of female bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) in an age-structured breeding population in large (0.25 ha) outdoor enclosures. We monitored survival, reproduction, and space use of experimental bank vole populations with females from two different age groups. Within the enclosures we manipulated the presence and absence of field voles. When coexisting with field voles, the year-born bank vole females had lower survival rates than the over-wintered ones did. Home ranges of bank voles were smaller in the presence of field voles than in their absence. Characteristics of litters of breeding females were not affected by the competition treatment. Reproduction of the youngest of the year-born females stopped earlier in the season than for over-wintered females although both age groups had reproduced prior to the trial. We did not observe indications of senescence, such as lower reproduction or survival of the over-wintered females in late summer. An earlier cessation of breeding in the younger females suggests an age-specific trade-off of summer reproduction and winter. survival for parous females. Inter- and intraspecific competition seemed to work additively on the year-born, females through direct interference. By selectively reducing survival of younger breeders, interspecific competition could influence age distribution and population growth of breeders toward the end of the breeding season. Because old, over-wintered females are not surviving to the next noribreeding season, the lower survival of young breeders through interspecific competition might impact greatly the structure of the breeding population at the start of the next breeding season, thus altering population growth patterns.

AB The ecology and dispersal dynamics of unicolonial ant invaders are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the genetic structure of a well-documented, invading population of Argentine ants in the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve in northern California to examine the dispersal distances of reproductives, the direction and mode of population expansion, and changes in the genetic differentiation among nests over time. Using microsatellite data, we measure both traditional F-ST statistics and multi-locus genotype assignment distances to determine the patterns of genetic structure at three spatial scales: population-wide gene flow, population substructure, and mixing between neigh-boring nests. At the population level, there was little viscosity across the Jasper Ridge population, suggesting recent rapid expansion and/or considerable long-distance gene flow, presumably mediated by winged males. The pattern of genetic structure across distance indicates that the scale of queen dispersal was limited to less than 100 m. At the level of population substructure, hierarchical F statistics measures were low across subpopulations, locations within subpopulations, and nests. However, multi-locus genotype assignment tests revealed significant structure between subpopulations and between locations. Genetic distances between nests were lower within locations than between locations, indicating that nests are most closely related to neighboring nests and that the expansion of subpopulations is primarily due to the local budding of new nests from existing nests at the invasion front. At the level of nest connectivity, the genetic differentiation among neighboring nests was associated with the time since invasion. As the invasion proceeds, nearby nests tend to be less closely related, indicating that extensive local mixing does not occur among more established nests. Our results show that the genetic structure of nests was not homogenous across unicolonial populations. Instead, the patterns of genetic structure reflect the limitations of and barriers to the dispersal of Argentine ant reproductives, the demographic history of the Jasper Ridge invasion, and changes in the genetic and ecological environment during the course of the invasion.

AB Pollinators provide essential ecosystem services, and declines in some pollinator communities around the world have been reported. Understanding the fundamental components defining these communities is essential if conservation and restoration are to be successful. We examined the structure of plant-pollinator communities in a dynamic Mediterranean landscape, comprising a mosaic of post-fire regenerating habitats, and which is a recognized global hotspot for bee diversity. Each community was characterized by a highly skewed species abundance distribution, with a few dominant and many rare bee species, and was consistent with a log series model indicating that a few environmental factors govern the community.
   Floral community composition, the quantity and quality of forage resources present, and the geographic locality organized bee communities at various levels: (1) The overall structure of the bee community (116 species), as revealed through ordination, was dependent upon nectar resource diversity (defined as the variety of nectar volume-concentration combinations available), the ratio of pollen to nectar energy, floral diversity, floral abundance, and post-fire age. (2) Bee diversity, measured as species richness, was closely linked to floral diversity (especially of annuals), nectar resource diversity, and post-fire age of the habitat. (3) The abundance of the most common species was primarily related to post-fire age, grazing intensity, and nesting substrate availability. Ordination models based on age-characteristic post-fire floral community structure explained 39-50% of overall variation observed in bee community structure. Cluster analysis showed that all the communities shared a high degree of similarity in their species composition (27-59%); however, the geographical location of sites also contributed a smaller but significant component to bee community structure.
   We conclude that floral resources act in specific and previously unexplored ways to modulate the diversity of the local geographic species pool, with specific disturbance factors, superimposed upon these patterns, mainly affecting the dominant species.

AB Geographic variation can lead to the evolution of different local varieties within a given species, therefore influencing its distribution and genetic structure. We investigated the contribution of plasticity and local adaptation to the performance of a common aquatic plant (Potamogeton pectinatus) in contrasting climates, using reciprocal transplants at three experimental sites across a latitudinal cline in Europe. Plants from 54 genets, originally collected from 14 populations situated within four climatic regions (sub-arctic, cold temperate, mild temperate, and mediterranean) were grown in three different localities within three of these regions (cold temperate, Norway; mild temperate, The Netherlands; mediterranean, Spain), Tuber production was highest for the mild-temperate genets, irrespective of locality where the genets were grown. Selection coefficients indicated, that populations at the European center of the species distribution perform better than all other populations, at all sites. However, marginal populations showed changes in life-history traits, such as compressed life cycles in the north and true perenniality in the south, that may allow them to perform better locally, at the limits of their distribution, range. Our results thus suggest that local adaptation may overlap spatially with center-periphery gradients in performance caused by genetic factors (such as genetic drift and inbreeding in range-marginal populations).

AB Successful transmission of plant diseases over long distances through the atmosphere depends on the reproductive rate of the pathogens, on the carrying capacity of the source locality, on atmospheric turbulence, stability, and wind speed, and on the survival of spores during exposure to inhospitable temperature and humidity and to UVB radiation from the sun. These interacting factors were incorporated into a model to estimate the rate and extent of seasonal incursions of disease from southern into northern areas of the United States. The model indicates a practical limit for long-distance dispersal (LDD) of a plant pathogen, which depends strongly on its fecundity and on its ability to survive in the atmosphere. Two classic plant diseases, stem rust of wheat and tobacco blue mold, are used to illustrate the model. Both diseases appear to spread northward on average at about the same rate as the seasonal advance of the "green wave" of available susceptible host tissue. The near concordance of the disease wave and the green wave underscores two important points. First, it suggests that disease spread over long distances may be limited more often by pathogen establishment than by LDD. The green wave also reduces the stochastic variability and speed of disease spread by presenting a barrier to potential long-distance, low-probability dispersal events. Second, it helps to focus attention on alternative pathways for disease spread and on possible unappreciated niches for overseasoning, both of which can have important implications for disease control strategies.

AB Reduction in the photosynthetic capacity of plants is presumed to negatively affect their fungal symbionts. To test this hypothesis under natural conditions, we artificially removed 100% of previous year needles in two successive years on Scots pine trees (Pinus sylvestris L.) to simulate pine sawfly attack. Despite a decline in the shoot growth of defoliated trees, root biomass did not differ from control trees. The ergosterol (fungal biomass) and starch concentration of fine roots, however, slightly declined in defoliated trees. Percent ectomycorrhizal colonization of fine root tips remained high in both defoliated and control trees. The dominant tubercle morphotypes were slightly more abundant in the control than in defoliated trees. In contrast to the relatively weak effects on vegetative ectomycorrhizae, reproduction declined near the defoliated pines. Average sporocarp numbers and, consequently, the relative fungal investment to reproduction of the estimated total fungal biomass were more than three times higher near controls than defoliated trees in the first treatment year. Defoliation also reduced the diversity of ectomycorrhizal species producing sporocarps. Mutualistic fungal symbionts may thus alter their reproductive investment in response to restrictions on host resources. Because fungal biomass in the roots as well as colonization percentage remained unchanged, Scots pine evidently continues to invest in the maintenance of the symbiosis despite the reduced photosynthetic capacity due to defoliation.

AB There is increasing interest in predicting ecological processes. Methods to accomplish such predictions must account for uncertainties in observation, sampling, models, and parameters. Statistical methods for spatiotemporal processes are powerful, yet difficult to implement in complicated high-dimensional settings. However, recent advances in hierarchical formulations for such processes can be utilized for ecological prediction. These formulations are able to account for the various sources of uncertainty and can incorporate scientific judgment in a probabilistically consistent manner. In particular, analytical diffusion models can serve as motivation for the hierarchical model for invasive species. We demonstrate by example that such a framework can be utilized to predict, spatially and temporally, the relative population abundance of House Finches over the, eastern United States.

AB The impact of trophic cascades on the interspecific relationship between two omnivorous stream fish, ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis) and Japanese dace (Tribolodon hakonensis), were analyzed in experimental pools. Benthic algae grew on the pool beds, and macroinvertebrates colonized the pools. Ayu predominantly grazed the algae, occasionally forming territories. Japanese dace fed on both benthic algae and invertebrates when ayu were absent, and predominantly on invertebrates when ayu were present. The presence of Japanese dace reduced the number of invertebrates and increased algal biomass (chlorophyll a) through trophic cascades, but the effects of respiration and excretion of dace did not notably increase algal biomass probably because the water continuously pumped into the pools was already nutrient rich. The growth rate of ayu was enhanced in the presence of Japanese dace due to increased algal biomass. In contrast, as the number of ayu increased, the growth rate of Japanese dace was reduced because of the exploitation of benthic algae and occasional attacks by ayu on dace. The relationship between ayu and Japanese dace is not merely competitive, but partly indirect contramensalism through trophic cascades. The occasional attacks by ayu on Japanese dace were mainly directed at individuals moving near the pool beds and therefore might function to increase benthic algal resources by limiting grazing by dace.

AB The strength of cascading effects from predators to plants is a controversial issue in work addressing terrestrial trophic interactions. While suppressing herbivores, the effects of some predators dissipate through two trophic levels and only modestly affect land plants. I addressed the strength of the indirect effect of the predatory nematode Heterorhabditis marelatus on the bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus), where the nematode may protect the plant by killing root-feeding ghost moth (Hepialus californicus) caterpillars. I manipulated both predators and herbivores and measured all three components of this cascade in the field. Lupine bushes in eight plots had 24 caterpillars added to each bush's rhizosphere. Four plots had nematode predators added to the soil, while four control plots had no nematodes added. Cascading effects on lupine growth and fitness occurred quickly. The nematode halved herbivore densities in three months, increased lupine trunk growth by 67% within eight months, and increased seed set by 44% in three months. Combined with previous experiments, this result identifies the system as a potent terrestrial trophic cascade. By protecting bush lupine, a nitrogen fixer, this predator may mediate the plant's community effects. Though poorly known, underground predators can have profound effects on terrestrial communities.

AB The major starting point to life history analysis is the schedule of reproduction and mortality; hence, knowledge of age-specific demographic dynamics is needed. The key ingredients to studies on age-specific demography must include large cohorts of individuals of known age, an accurate accounting of all individuals, and an experimental design to facilitate a separation of age-dependent and age-independent dynamics.
   In this study with Plantago lanceolata, multiple, large cohorts were planted over four successive years, and the individuals were censused monthly for nearly five years. Longitudinal analysis showed seasonal variation in demography that was correlated with maximum temperature and cumulative precipitation. Cross-sectional analysis of the different cohorts showed variation across cohorts in age-specific demography. The cohort with the lowest juvenile mortality had the highest adult mortality and the lowest fecundity, suggesting that there is an interdependence of demographic patterns across life stages and that the history of mortality within a cohort may be critical to late-age demographic patterns.

TI Predicting the number of new species in further taxonomic sampling

ID ESTIMATOR; RICHNESS; COVERAGE
AB In evaluating the effectiveness of further sampling in species taxonomic surveys, a practical and important problem is predicting the number of new species that would be observed in a second survey, based on data from an initial survey. This problem can also be approached by estimating the corresponding expected number of new species. A. R. Solow and S. Polasky recently proposed a predictor (or estimator), with the form of a sum of many terms, that was derived under the assumption that all unobserved species in the initial sample have equal relative abundances. We show in this paper that the summation can be expressed as only one term. We provide a direct justification for the simplified estimator and connect it to an extrapolation formula based on a special type of species accumulation curve. Using the proposed justification, we show that, for large sample sizes, the estimator is also valid under an alternative condition, i.e., species that are represented the same number of times in the initial sample have equal relative abundances in the community. This condition is statistically justified from a Bayesian approach, although the estimator exhibits moderate negative bias for predicting larger samples in highly heterogeneous communities. In such situations, we recommend the use of a modified estimator that incorporates a measure of heterogeneity among species abundances. An example using field data from the extant rare vascular plant species patterns in the southern Appalachians is presented to compare the various methods.

AB Predators often induce shifts in the traits of nearby prey, and these trait shifts are important in mediating a variety of evolutionary and ecological processes. However, little is known about the spatial and temporal scales over which predators induce trait shifts. We empirically determined the spatial scale of predator avoidance by measuring the habitat use and growth rates of snails (Physa acuta) held at varying distances from a caged pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus). Refuge use was highest near the fish and gradually decayed to background level, with a characteristic response range of 1.0 m. Snail growth rates were negligible near the predator but increased with greater separation from fish. The dependence of behavior on the age of chemical cues was measured in a mesocosm experiment in which water was withdrawn from a tank holding pumpkinseeds and held for varying lengths of time before being added to experimental mesocosms with snails. Fresh cues elicited the strongest habitat shifts relative to well-water controls, and avoidance behavior decayed in an exponential manner with increasing cue age. The characteristic lifetime of avoidance behavior was 41 h. Taken together, these results allow us to begin to describe the behavioral landscape created by mobile predators.

AB For three years, we manipulated litter size by adding or subtracting pups in eight wild populations of the bank vole, Clethrionomys glareolus, to examine reproductive costs and allocation of reproductive effort between offspring number and size. In general, litter enlargements did not increase the number of weanlinis per mother and significantly. decreased the size of weanlings. Reproductive effort and the breeding success of individuals varied within breeding seasons, but time of breeding and litter manipulation did not interact to affect reproductive trade-offs. Our 3-yr field experiment revealed that litter enlargements also reduced survival and fecundity of mothers. Small mammals have been considered typical income breeders, in which potential reproductive costs may be masked due to their ability to compensate for increased energetic demands of reproduction. Our results-provide evidence that, in the wild, females may be incapable of escaping the costs of reproduction.

AB For plant species adapted to disturbances. the germination niche breadth (the time span within a year during which the species is able to germinate) may he a key in understanding the variability of range sizes across species. Species that Life able to germinate throughout the year should be able to use more disturbances and build up large local populations, As population size is correlated to distribution, one would expect a curl-elation between the temporal germination pattern and distributional range sizes, For a test of this hypotheses, we used germination patterns and local abundance data from 3 1 weedy plant species from an abandoned field in eastern Germany. In cross-species and phylogeneticalty controlled analyses, the germination niche breadth was cot-related to range Size on tile national, as well as the continental scale. However, significant correlation.,, between germination niche breadth and abundance. as well as abundance and range size. appeared only in a phylogenetically controlled analysis. In multiple regression analyses, the germination niche breadth turned out to be the most important predictor of distributional range sizes for our subset of weedy species. These results suggest that. for weedy species. the germination niche breadth influences distributional range size, However, the detailed Process behind these relationships remains elusive. Nevertheless. the regeneration niche of plants may be a useful concept for exploring macroecological relationships in plants.

AB Survival rates during the first winter of life are strongly size dependent and variable in many temperate fish populations. Starvation is often implicated as the cause of size-dependent first-winter mortality, and interannual variation in energy accumulation and the allocation between growth and storage is a likely source of variability. We examined these processes in young-of-the-year Hudson River striped bass Morone saxatilis, which are known to experience size-selective winter mortality and a winter energy deficit. Neutral-lipid and lean-tissue masses were determined for fish of five consecutive year classes collected through the first year of life. Differences in scaling relationships between body length and neutral-lipid and lean-tissue mass were used to infer patterns of resource allocation. Lipid reserves scaled isometrically with body length in summer but increased at a greater rate than did body length in autumn and winter. Lean-tissue allometries were less variable but followed a similar seasonal cycle. Allometric slopes were homogeneous across years, but significant interannual variation in length-specific lipid content and lean-tissue mass in the later half of the growing season indicated variable allocation patterns. During winter, up to 21% of total energy content and 50% of neutral-lipid stores were depleted. The-results indicate that energy allocation patterns result from interactions among season, ontogenetic stage, and body size. The variation in growth, allocation, and severity of the winter energy deficit likely interact to determine first-winter survival.

   STRESS
AB Identifying key traits that shape trade-offs that restrict species to only a subset of environmental gradients is crucial to understanding and predicting species turnover. Previous field experiments have shown that larvae of Lestes damselfly species segregate along the entire gradient of pond permanence and predator presence and that differential predation risk and life history constraints together shape their distribution. Here, we report laboratory experiments that identify key differences in behavior and physiology among species that structure their distributions along this gradient. The absence of adaptive antipredator behavioral responses against large dragonfly larvae and fish of Lestes dryas, the only species to inhabit predator-free vernal ponds that dry each year, is consistent with its high vulnerability to predation and probably the key trait that excludes it from parts of the gradient with predators. The reciprocal dominance of two other Lestes species in permanent waters dominated by either dragonflies or fish can be explained by the lack of effective antipredator behaviors against dragonflies and fish, respectively. Maximal growth rates did not differ among Lestes along the gradient. However, in the natural predator environment of vernal ponds (only conspecific cannibals), the vernal-pond Lestes had higher growth rates than the other Lestes suggesting that this excludes other Lestes from vernal ponds. Similarly, Lestes species that inhabit temporary ponds (i.e., ponds that dry intermittently every few years but not every year) had a higher growth rate than the fishless permanent-pond Lestes in the presence of the syntopic dragonfly predator. These growth differences among Lestes in predator treatments were not due to differences in food intake, but due to differences in physiology. The vernal-pond Lestes converted more assimilated food into body mass compared to the other Lestes in the presence of conspecific larvae, and the temporary-pond Lestes had a higher conversion efficiency than the fishless permanent-pond Lestes in the presence of the syntopic dragonfly predators. In contrast, reductions in growth rate within species in the presence of syntopic predators were both physiologically and behaviorally mediated. The interplay between behavior and physiology may be a common feature of the growth/predation-risk trade-off, and their joint study is therefore critical to mechanistically link phenotype, performance, and community assembly along the freshwater habitat gradient.

AB There is considerable interest in determining whether the species richness of communities is determined by forces controlling dispersal into patches that operate at the landscape scale, or forces controlling persistence that act at the local scale. Understanding the relative importance of these two classes of factors in controlling within-patch species richness is particularly important when patches are created via ecosystem engineering. In such cases, factors affecting the population dynamics or behavior of a single species could indirectly affect species richness if richness is controlled primarily by landscape-level factors. We used a combination of experimental mesocosms and field observations to determine whether species richness in beaver wetlands in the Adirondack Mountains (New York) is more strongly controlled by the position of the wetland in the landscape or by within-wetland hydrology. Drainage rate had a significant effect on both richness and composition in mesocosms, with well-drained treatments having significantly higher richness than poorly drained treatments. Seed germinated from the seed bank in sediments collected from different ponds showed relatively small differences in richness or community composition in mesocosms, suggesting a comparatively small effect of dispersal limitation on species richness. Experimental results were mirrored in a survey of 14 meadows over two years, which indicated that variability in water table depth was consistently a significant predictor of species richness, while meadow area and isolation showed little relation to richness. The survey also suggested that the number of years since beaver had abandoned a site was a significant predictor of the number of species found in beaver meadows. The results indicate that species richness in beaver meadows is strongly controlled by local factors', but that the population dynamics of beaver could also potentially affect species richness by altering the age distribution of meadows across the landscape.

AB Herbivore alteration of litter inputs may change litter decomposition rates and influence ecosystem nutrient cycling. In a semiarid woodland at Sunset Crater National Monument, Arizona, long-term insect herbivore removal experiments and the presence of herbivore resistant and susceptible pinyon pines (Pinus edulis) have allowed characterization of the population- and community-level effects of herbivory. Here we report how these same two herbivores, the mesophyll-feeding scale insect Matsucoccus acalyptus and the stem-boring moth Dioryctria albovittella alter litter quality, dynamics, and decomposition in this ecosystem. We measured aboveground litterfall, litter chemical composition, and first-year litter decomposition rates for trees resistant and susceptible to both herbivores and for susceptible trees from which herbivores had been experimentally removed for 16-18 years. Both herbivores significantly increased nitrogen concentration and decreased lignin:nitrogen and carbon:nitrogen ratios of aboveground litter. Herbivory by scale insects also increased litter phosphorus concentration and annual needle litterfall mass. Consistent with its increased chemical quality, litter from herbivore-susceptible trees decomposed more rapidly in the first year. These results suggest that herbivory may increase nutrient cycling rates in this system by altering the chemical quality of litter, a mechanism that augments the nutrient acceleration hypothesis. The distribution of trees resistant and susceptible to the two herbivores at our site, and their associated variation in litter quality and decomposition, likely creates a mosaic of litter quality and nutrient cycling rates at the landscape scale. Further, because the differences in litter quality are associated with tree resistance and susceptibility traits, our findings are among the first to establish that intraspecific genetic variation may affect ecosystem function.

AB It has been debated whether pollination success in nonrewarding plants that flower in association with nectar-producing plants will be diminished by competition for pollinator visits or, alternatively, enhanced through increased local abundance of pollinators (the magnet species effect). We experimentally evaluated these effects using the nonrewarding bumblebee-pollinated orchid Anacamptis morio and associated nectar-producing plants at a site in Sweden. Pollination success (estimated as pollen receipt and pollen removal) in A. morio was significantly greater for individuals translocated to patches of nectar-producing plants (Geum rivale and Allium schoenoprasum) than for individuals placed outside (similar to20 m away) such patches. These results provide support for the existence of a facilitative magnet species effect in the interaction between certain nectar plants and A. morio. To determine the spatial scale of these interactions, we correlated the visitation rate to flowers of A. morio with the density of sympatric nectar plants in 1-m(2) and 100-m(2) plots centered around groups of translocated plants, and at the level of whole meadows (similar to0.5-2 ha). Visitation rate to flowers of A. morio was not correlated with the 1-m(2) patch density of G. rivale and A. schoenoprasum, but showed a significant positive relationship with density of these nectar plants in 100-m(2) plots. In addition, visitation to flowers of A. morio was strongly and positively related to the density of A. schoenoprasum at the level of the meadow. Choice experiments showed that bees foraging on the purple flowers of A. schoenoprasum (a particularly effective magnet species) visit the purple flowers of A. morio more readily (47.6% of choices) than bees foraging on the yellow flowers of Lotus corniculatus (17% of choices). Overall similarity in flower color and shape may increase the probability that a pollinator will temporarily shift from a nectar-producing "magnet" plant to a nonrewarding plant. We discuss the possibility of a mimicry continuum between those orchids that exploit instinctive food-seeking behavior of pollinators and those that show an adaptive resemblance to nectar-producing plants.

AB Selection experiments in the wild have greatly aided our understanding of how selection shapes phenotypic diversity in natural populations. However, these experiments have been hindered by the fact that the traits most important to adaptation and speciation may be fixed within populations. Experimental hybridization offers a means to circumvent this problem since crosses can be made between populations or species that differ for the trait of interest. Here, we discuss the advantages and limitations of this approach, review results from published studies, and suggest strategies for future experiments. Advantages associated with this approach include the ability to "generate" variation for traits of interest, as well as the increased sensitivity of selection assays because of the wider range of trait values characteristic of segregating hybrids. Moreover, experimental hybridization can be extended to crosses between near-isogenic lines, allowing the effects of major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) to be dissected in a well-defined genetic background. Limitations include widespread linkage disequilibrium created by hybridization, possible cosegregation of hybrid incompatibilities, and the large number of variable traits likely to affect hybrid fitnesses. Even with these limitations, this basic approach has been remarkably successful. We now know, for example, that many morphological differences between divergent populations or species are under selection and that the selection gradients may be surprisingly large. Also, small genetic changes in premating barriers may have large effects on assortative mating. With respect to discussions about the role of hybridization in evolution, experiments indicate that some hybrid trait combinations may be advantageous, particularly when the hybrid populations are placed in a new environment. Future studies seem likely to combine selection measurements with genetic mapping of the QTLs underlying the selected traits. Natural hybrid zones hold particular promise for these kinds of studies because the only experimental manipulation required is, the removal of small amounts of tissue for genotyping.

AB Population viability analysis (PVA) is frequently used to quantify the level of risk associated with various populations and also to examine the relative benefits of alternative management actions. Typically, model predictions are extremely sensitive to estimated parameters, resulting in risk estimates that are very imprecise. Therefore, careful consideration of uncertainty is warranted when reporting PVA predictions. Here, we survey some simple and general simulation-based methods for assessing the uncertainty in model-based forecasts. We then illustrate how these methods can be used for incorporating parameter uncertainty when reporting estimates of extinction risk, using a PVA model developed from data on Pacific Chinook salmon stocks. Several researchers have suggested that relative assessments between management options will be more stable than estimates of extinction risk and population growth rate. We illustrate how the uncertainty in relative assessments can be quantified in a rigorous way. Finally, we show how Sobol' indices can be used to ask: "Where is the uncertainty coming from?" These indices are an ANOVA-like decomposition of the effects of parameters on model output that take into account both direct effects (as in standard sensitivity analysis) and effects due to interactions with other parameters. Throughout, we illustrate these methods using models relevant to the life cycle of Pacific salmon, with the intent of assessing the relative influences of habitat, harvest, and hatcheries on the viability of salmon populations. However, the same approaches are applicable to most situations where a model with estimated parameters is being used for forecasting or comparing management options.

AB Disturbance of forest ecosystems, such as that caused by harvesting or acid deposition, is thought to alter the ability of the ecosystem to retain nutrients. Although many watershed studies have suggested depletion of available calcium (Ca) pools, interpretation of ecosystem Ca mass balance has been limited by the difficulty in obtaining mineral weathering flux estimates. While many studies have suggested that weathering flux is insufficient to maintain available soil pools, measurements of concomitant changes in available soil pools are rare. Here, we critically examined application of the Ca:Na ratio method in interpreting the long-term. Ca budget of six northern hardwood watershed ecosystems at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, Woodstock, New Hampshire, USA. Storage of sodium (Na) in biomass and secondary minerals and on cation exchange sites was low enough so that net ecosystem Na loss was essentially equivalent to mineral weathering flux. Mineral chemistry and mass balance considerations constrained the Ca:Na ratio of weathering products to a sufficiently narrow range that spatial and temporal changes in the ecosystem Ca:Na ratio could be interpreted as changes in contribution of available Ca pools to ecosystem loss. Depletion of available Ca pools was greater in the three experimentally manipulated watersheds with aggrading biomass compared to three reference watersheds with relatively mature forest conditions. Although accelerated loss of Ca in the first few years following disturbance has been documented by prior studies, this study suggests that excess Ca loss continues for at least three decades after treatment, with no evident trend toward the conditions shown in the reference watershed. It is not likely that changes in previously quantified Ca pools account for this sustained loss, suggesting that a previously unstudied Ca pool or release. mechanism may be important in ecosystem response to disturbance. Possible sources include Ca oxalate, which is known to accumulate in forest soils, but has not been considered in the context of an ecosystem mass balance.

AB The sex ratio of post-emergence offspring of the European badger Meles meles in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK did not differ significantly from 50% between 1987 and 2001. Insofar as male offspring are more costly to rear successfully, mothers optimized cub productivity with regard to the level of resource,; that they could invest. When females had a relatively high index of body condition, they implanted early: when implantation was early, the cub sex ratio was male biased. Additionally. years with a male-biased cub sex ratio coincided with a significantly larger cub coliort. These results do not support the local resource competition hypothesis, which proposes that in years when female body condition is poor, females should lower competition for local resources by producing the dispersing sex, i.e.. males. The potential mechanisms by which offspring sex ratios may be skewed are discussed. Overall. it appears that bias in the cub sex ratio may result from a combination of adaptive parental strategies, differential infanticide by individuals other than the mother, and differential fetal mortality between the sexes.

AB Here we present a meta-analytic approach to analyzing Population interactions across the North Atlantic Ocean. We assembled all available biomass time series for a well-documented predator-prey couple, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), to test whither the temporal dynamics of these populations are consistent with the "top-down" or the "bottom-up" hypothesis. Eight out of nine regions showed inverse correlations of cod and shrimp biomass supporting the "top-down" view. Exceptions occurred only close to the southern range limits of both species, Random-effects meta-analysis showed that shrimp biomass was strongly negatively related to cod biomass, but not to Ocean temperature in the North Atlantic Ocean. In contrast, cod biomass was positively related to ocean temperature. The strength of the cod-shrimp relationship. however, declined with increasing mean temperature.
   These results show that changes in predator Populations can have strong effects on prey populations in oceanic food webs, and that the strength of these interactions may be sensitive to changes in mean ocean temperature. This means that the effects of overfishing in the ocean cascade down to lower trophic levels, as has been shown previously for lakes and coastal seas. In order to further investigate these processes, we establish a methodological framework to analyze species interactions from time series data.

AB We analyzed spatial variations in movements and survival in a roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) population (Chize, western France) by using recent developments of multistate capture-mark-recapture modeling in order to estimate transition and survival probabilities of individuals living in three habitats of contrasting quality. Irrespective of both population density and sex, habitat quality did not influence survivorship of prime-age or senescent roe deer. Likewise, habitat quality did not influence fawn survival at low density. On the other hand, fawn survival at high density was 20% higher in the resource-rich hornbeam-dominant coppices than in the other poorer habitats. We found, as expected, that fawns were mobile, whereas adults of both sexes were highly sedentary. Movements of roe deer among habitats were markedly influenced by habitat quality. Transition probabilities of individuals from the rich hornbeam coppices toward other habitats were lower than transition probabilities of individuals from the poor beech stand or from the medium-quality maple dominant coppices toward the rich hornbeam coppices.

AB To date, there is a lack of well-controlled field experiments that disentangle the effects of the intervening matrix from other landscape variables (e.g., patch geography or quality) that might influence animal dispersal among patches. We performed a field experiment to investigate how the movement of a delphacid planthopper (Prokelisia crocea) among discrete patches of prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata) is affected by the composition of the matrix (mudflat, native nonhost grasses, and the introduced grass smooth brome [Bromus inermis]). Within each matrix type, marked planthoppers were released onto experimental cordgrass patches that were made identical in size, isolation, and host plant quality. We found that the emigration rate (planthoppers lost per patch per day) was 1.3 times higher for patches embedded in the two nonhost grass matrix types than for patches in mudflat. The rate of immigration (immigrants per patch per day) into patches isolated by 3 m was 5.4 times higher in the brome than in the mudflat matrix. Patches in the native grass matrix had intermediate immigration rates. In addition, a survey of planthopper distributions in nature revealed that both the within- and among-patch distributions of the planthopper were related to the composition of the matrix. Within patches, individuals accumulated against mudflat edges (relative to patch interiors) but not against nonhost grass edges. Among patches, incidence and density increased with the proportion of the matrix composed of open mud. The matrix was equal to that of patch geography (size and isolation) in its ability to explain the distribution of the planthopper. We suggest that the low permeability of the mudflat relative to a nonhost grass edge may explain these planthopper distributional patterns. Also, because natural cordgrass patches in mudflat were richer in nutrients than those in nonhost grasses, planthoppers may have been more likely to remain and build up densities on the former patches. We predict that the displacement of native matrix types by invasive brome will result in increased connectivity and greater spatial synchrony in densities of planthoppers among cordgrass patches.

AB The boundaries between vegetation patches are focal points for dynamic interactions between plant communities, particularly in,grazed ecosystems where vegetation types may differ in their acceptability to herbivores. Here we show that key vegetation resources attract herbivores, and the surrounding vegetation receives a higher impact than if it is associated with patches of less preferred vegetation (an example of apparent competition). We studied the influence of proximity to preferred grass patches on utilization of the less preferred dwarf shrub, heather (Calluna vulgaris) by red deer (Cervus elaphus) and sheep (Ovis aries) at a range of spatial scales in the Cairngorm Mountains of Scotland, UK. There was a sharp decline in heather utilization with increasing distance from the edges of grass patches. The proportion of grass in the local landscape (within I km) had a significant positive effect on heather utilization both at the grass-heather boundary and beyond 5 m from the grass patch. There was also a significant effect of dominant grass species on the utilization of heather within 50 cm of the grass-patch edge, with utilization around Agrostis/Festuca patches (most preferred) being greater than around Nardus-dominated patches, and lowest around patches of Molinia. The greatest contribution to variation in heather utilization was at the smallest scale, and variance components decreased as spatial scale increased, making it impossible to predict local heather utilization (i.e., at the scale of individual plants and of individual bites by foraging ungulates) from large-scale parameters alone, such as herbivore density. These findings emphasize that vegetation-herbivore interactions are localized within the landscape, and that it is these hot spots which are the key fulcrum for vegetation dynamics.

AB The risk to passerine birds of predation by the Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) was analyzed with respect to differences in plumage brightness, body mass, and density of prey species, while taking into account phylogenetic relatedness of species. Data were collected from published sources in five separate areas along a south-north geographical gradient in Finland and consisted of 2214 prey remains collected from Sparrowhawk nests. Prey plumage brightness was the most important factor determining vulnerability to predation. In adults, male brightness was more important than female brightness in explaining prey vulnerability. Prey abundance did not affect the relationship between predation vulnerability and plumage brightness, because both rare and common species with bright plumage suffered higher predation. Prey species with large body mass were more vulnerable to predation in northern Finland, suggesting that in northern harsh conditions, Sparrowhawks may prefer large prey in order to fulfill their daily energy requirements. Our analyses provide evidence that predation may impose viability costs on sexually selected traits such as plumage brightness and body size.

AB Tropical deforestation is a progressive process resulting in the conversion of rain forest into a mosaic of mature forest fragments, pasture, and degraded habitat. Understanding the long-term effects of habitat fragmentation on tropical plant community structure is critical to predicting how alterations to the landscape will impact tropical biodiversity. The objective of this study was to examine fragmentation effects on the composition, abundance, and species richness of epiphyllous (leaf- inhabiting) bryophytes. I conducted this research in an experimentally fragmented forest reserve in central Amazonia where data on the distriblition and abundance of 65 bryophyte taxa were analyzed from 16 1-ha sample plots located in continuous forest and fragments. Epiphyll communities inhabiting small (1- and 10-ha) fragments exhibited lower species richness, abundance, and among-site compositional variation than those from 100-ha fragments and continuous forest plots. Reduced epiphyll diversity in small fragments is not simply a statistical artifact of low epiphyll densities, but rather due to a disproportionate loss of regionally common taxa. In contrast, rare taxa responded marginally to fragmentation, and in most cases were more abundant in fragments than in continuous forest habitat. Because epiphyllous bryophytes rapidly establish species-rich communities on spatially discrete habitat patches, they are an ideal plant group for addressing the long-term (multigeneration) impact of habitat fragmentation on plant communities.

AB Few studies have linked long-term herbivore population dynamics with plant genetics. In this study we present evidence that plant genotype and hybridization influence the population dynamics of the poplar bud gall mite, Aceria parapopuli. Using experimental transfers and a five-year data set on mite abundance on two cottonwood species (Populus fremontii and P angustifolia) and their naturally occurring hybrids,we demonstrated that hybrid trees exhibiting an F, morphology were, on average, extremely susceptible to A. parapopuli. The susceptibility of these hybrids ranged several orders of magnitude and affected the population dynamics of A. parapopuli across the five years of study. Populations grew exponentially on susceptible hybrids in every year, eventually reaching a mean of similar to140 galls per tree. In contrast, populations fluctuated around low densities (0.01-0.87 galls per tree) on,their parental host species. Low gall densities on parental trees resulted in high annual extinction rates (mean = 62%) for mite populations on individual parental trees,, in contrast to low annual extinction rates (mean = 7%) for mite populations on hybrid trees., We detected significant differences in gall population growth rates (intrinsic rate of increase, r) among hybrid genotypes across four years of study, ranging from r - 0 to r = 1.5, demonstrating that plant genotype influences a fundamental component of population dynamics. We argue that plant genotype should also impact metapopulation dynamics, because plant genotype affected the number of available colonists and directly affected mite extinction rates. If other arthropod species exhibit similar traits, these findings have important conservation implications. Because mite population growth and extinction are so closely tied to rare host genotypes, to conserve, such species we must preserve rare host genotypes, which would represent a major challenge to current conservation practices that target species rather than genotypes.

AB The slower-growth/higher-mortality hypothesis proposes that reduced herbivore growth rates benefit plants because slower growing herbivores remain vulnerable to predator attack for an extended time period, resulting in a lower reduction in plant fitness attributed to herbivory. We propose cooling events as an alternative mechanism leading to higher mortality for slower growing larvae. We observed that, in the absence of predators. slower growing pipevine swallowtail (Battus philenor) larvae had higher mortality compared to faster growing larvae during the unseasonably cool spring temperatures of 1998. However, this was not true for the warmer spring of 1999. Laboratory experiments showed that the probability of surviving a chill coma increased with larval mass. We propose that smaller larvae are susceptible to chilling events because they have less energy reserved for metabolism during a chill coma. and that "warm" chill events near the activity threshold may be more lethal than "cold" chill events. Weather station data since 195 1 and field data collected from 1976 to 2000 suggest that exposure to chill events below the chill coma threshold is not uncommon for these larvae. We propose that faster growth may be important for larvae because slower growing larvae remain at a chill-susceptible size for an extended period of time.

AB In experimental population ecology, there is often a gap between realistic models used to hypothesize about population dynamics and statistical models used to analyze data. Ecologists routinely conduct experiments where the data from each replicate are short time series of estimated population abundances structured by stage, species, and/or other information, and the conventional test for treatment effects uses a general linear model (GLM) such as analysis of variance (ANOVA). However, GLMs do not incorporate demographic relationships between abundances through time. An alternative is to use population-dynamics models as frameworks for statistical hypothesis testing. This approach requires general methods for-fitting structured population models that can incorporate both process noise (stochastic dynamics) and observation error (inaccurate data). This paper presents such methods and compares them to GLMs for testing population-dynamics hypotheses from experiments. The methods are Monte Carlo state-space likelihood methods, including a basic Monte Carlo integration method and a recently developed Monte Carlo kernel likelihood method.
   Three simulated examples of population-dynamics experiments were used to compare analysis with a population model to ANOVA, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and, repeated-measures ANOVA. The examples considered manipulations of host-plant growth conditions, causing decreased survival and increased fecundity; predator addition to investigate a behaviorally mediated change in prey demography; and changed host-plant growth conditions with a more complex model for herbivore dynamics than the one used for analysis. For the first example, a population model gave much, higher statistical power than any of the ANOVA methods and provides greater biological insight. For the second example, ANOVA models are not suited to test for the behavioral effect, but a population model detected it with high statistical power. The third example suggests that even incorrect biological structure can provide better inferences than omitting all biological structure. The likelihood methods presented here make analysis with structured population models feasible for a wide range of models incorporating process noise and observation error, thus offering higher statistical power and greater biological insight for population-dynamics experiments.

AB We tested whether Solidago canadensis, which was introduced from North America into Europe from the 17th century onward, has evolved an increased competitive ability (EICA) at the cost of tolerance against herbivory in its new ranged We grew plants from nine introduced European and 10 native American populations in a common garden in Europe. In half of the plants, we simulated herbivory by removing 50% of the leaf area and by spraying them with jasmonic acid. Although plants from Europe had 30.5% larger leaves, they had 27.4% smaller inflorescences and tended to grow less tall (-7.0%) and produce fewer vegetative offspring (-5.0%) than plants from North America. The simulated herbivory treatment did not result in any significant differences in height, inflorescence biomass, or number of vegetative offspring between treatment and control plants. Moreover, there were no significant differences in the response of European and American plants to simulated herbivory, indicating that they did not differ in their tolerance against herbivory. We conclude that the EICA-hypothesis does not hold in the case of the S. canadensis complex, and the worldwide invasion success. of this species must be based on other mechanisms.

AB Few species are likely to be so evident that they will always be defected when present: Failing to allow for the possibility that a target species was present, but undetected at a site will lead to biased estimates of site occupancy, colonization,and local extinction probabilities. These population vital rates are often of interest in long-term monitoring programs and metapopulation studies. We present a model that enables direct estimation of these parameters when the probability of detecting the species is less than 1. The model does not require any assumptions-of process stationarity, as do some previous methods, but does require detection/nondetection data to be collected in a-manner similar to. Pollock's robust design as used-in mark-recapture studies. Via simulation, we,show that the model provides good estimates of parameters for most scenarios considered. We illustrate the method with data from monitoring programs of Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) in northern California and tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) in Minnesota, USA.

AB A current debate in ecology centers on the extent to which ecosystem function depends on biodiversity. Here, we provide evidence from a long-term field manipulation of plant diversity that soil microbial communities, and the key ecosystem processes that they mediate, are significantly altered by plant species richness. After seven years of plant growth, we determined the composition and function of soil microbial communities beneath experimental plant diversity treatments containing 1-16 species. Microbial community biomass, respiration,. and fungal abundance significantly increased with greater plant diversity, as did N mineralization rates. However, changes in microbial community biomass, activity, and composition largely resulted-from the higher levels of plant production associated with greater diversity, rather than from plant diversity per se., Nonetheless, greater plant production could not explain more rapid N mineralization, indicating that plant diversity affected this microbial process, which controls. rates of ecosystem N cycling. Greater N availability probably contributed to the positive relationship between plant diversity and productivity in the N-limited soils of our experiment, suggesting that plant-microbe interactions in soil are an integral component of plant diversity's influence on ecosystem function.

AB Extinctions of plant and animal species are rarely observed directly and must be inferred from sighting or collection records. The inference about extinction that can be drawn from a sighting record depends on the sighting rate. Existing methods assume that the form of the sighting rate is known and may be sensitive to deviations from the assumed form. A simple nonparametric test is proposed that makes minimal assumptions about the sighting rate. The test is illustrated by application to collection records of nine Mauritian orchid species.

AB Decreased recruitment is hypothesized to be a primary mechanism driving the local extinctions of plant species from fragmented landscapes. A critical but untested assumption of this claim is that reductions in fecundity by individual plants actually result in demographic vulnerability at the population level. I tested this "recruitment limitation hypothesis" using three years of census data from 13 populations of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata, which I integrated with empirical estimates of seedling establishment into matrix demographic models. I asked: (1) How much recruitment is necessary for lambda > 1? (2) What are the projected values of lambda for H. acuminata populations in fragments and continuous forest, given empirical estimates of seedling emergence? (3) What are the actual values of lambda for populations in fragments and continuous forest, and why might projected and estimated values of lambda differ? (4) What other demographic stages contribute to lambda, and how are these affected by fragmentation? Simulation models suggest that extreme reductions in recruitment are necessary for population declines, and empirical estimates of seedling establishment were frequently below these thresholds. As a result, Heliconia actaninata populations in fragments are projected to shrink at a rate of 1-1.5% per year, while those in continuous forest are projected to grow 2.3-4% per year. Annual censuses, however, indicated populations in both continuous forest and fragments grew at rates well in excess of those projected by matrix models. This discrepancy is due to higher-than-predicted seedling numbers. While elasticity analyses indicated transitions related to growth and survivorship actually made the greatest proportional contribution to lambda, these results suggest that dispersal into fragments is common and helping populations overcome the negative demographic consequences of reduced seedling establishment. Additional demographic studies of plant populations in fragmented areas are urgently needed to identify other potential mechanisms responsible for population declines. Particular attention should be paid to appraising the effect of fragmentation on plant growth and survivorship, as altering these life-history stages may have the most serious consequences for population growth rates.

AB Theoretical models of plant range expansion require the assumption of occasional long-distance seed-dispersal events to explain post-glacial migration rates. For the many forest herbs whose seeds are dispersed primarily by ants, there are few documented mechanisms of occasional long-distance dispersal, so models of forest-herb migration have been largely phenomenological. Here we show that viable seeds of Trillium grandiflorum, an ant-dispersed forest herb in eastern North America, are dispersed via ingestion and defecation by white-tailed deer. We also use data from the literature on movement patterns and gut retention times to model a deer-generated seed shadow, showing that most seeds dispersed by deer should travel at least several hundred meters from parent plants, and occasionally >3 km. Our results provide a mechanism of long-distance dispersal that has likely contributed to rates of post-glacial migration and post-agricultural forest colonization.

AB In a replicated whole-lake experiment, we (a) tested for the existence of a flexible habitat shift in response to predator presence in age-0 rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) at risk of cannibalism and (b) evaluated the population-level consequences of habitat shifts in terms of growth and survival over their first growing season. Daphnid food and adult trout predators were substantially more abundant in pelagic than in littoral habitats. Age-0 trout used all habitats in populations without adult trout predators, whereas age-0 trout were observed only in the less profitable littoral habitat in populations with adult trout. Consequently, mean fall mass of age-0 trout in the presence of predators was almost half that observed in populations without adult trout. Despite the shift in habitat use, age-0 trout experienced 90% mortality when adult trout predators were present, in comparison to only 36% mortality when absent. We conclude that the commonly observed habitat shifts by fish at risk of predation, observed at smaller scales, do in fact occur at the whole-system scale over long time intervals. These results suggest that fish are able to perceive risk at large spatial scales and thus take advantage of profitable (but normally risky) habitats when predators are absent, or move to less profitable refuge habitats when predators are present.
