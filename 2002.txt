AB The abundances and spatial distribution of species is central to biogeography and conservation. Several theories have been offered to explain landscape-scale species distribution patterns. The verification of biogeographic theories, as well as conservation decisions, must be based upon empirical data gathered from necessarily restricted censuses. It is necessary, therefore, to understand the relationship between an underlying landscape-scale pattern and the corresponding pattern it produces upon sampling small subregions. The similarity of species composition between two samples depends not only on the species composition of the underlying landscape from which the samples are drawn, but also on the underlying distribution of species abundances, the degree of conspecific spatial clustering, and sample size. In this paper, we investigate how sampling expectations change depending upon species abundance distributions and upon spatial distributions. We derive analytical results for the expected species overlap between two sampled regions under a wide range of conditions. We compare these results with data from a 50-ha tropical forest census. These methodologies provide useful tools for assessing beta diversity, for testing macro-ecological theory, and for designing landscape-scale sampling schemes.

AB A sequence of changes in vital rates observed as populations approach maximal levels has been used as the basis for a. "paradigm" for population analysis. Previous work indicates that early survival decreases first, followed by lower reproductive rates; ultimately, adult female survival may decrease. "Sensitivity" of population growth rates, as measured by partial derivatives of an approximation to the Lotka-Leslie model, appears to follow the same sequence, suggesting that population regulation may follow that sequence. This may imply some evolutionary significance in the sequence.
   Thus, it may be possible to assess population status by measuring the vital rates, as shown in a number of examples reported here. Measuring vital rates in the field is subject to a variety of biases; hence, an analysis should include direct estimates of population trend. In the absence of complete data, suitable trend data might be used to estimate missing rates. Bootstrapping provides a simple way to obtain confidence intervals, and the delta method can be used to obtain components of variance and thus improve sampling. Various methods for studying trend are given, with examples and simple statistical tests.

AB In recent years, ecologists have begun to develop a More fine-grained and integrative approach to examining the importance Of top-down and bottom-up effects on herbivore populations by investigating how changes in abiotic heterogeneity affect the relative roles of these forces. We performed two factorial field experiments to determine how increasing salinity and nutrient supply affected the relative strengths of top-down and bottom-up forces among the gall-making midge, Asphondylia borrichiae, its host plant Borrichia frutescens, and a suite of parasitoids. Salinity was increased by the addition of salt pellets, and nutrient supply was increased by the addition of fertilizer.
   In both experiments, parasitism pressure was decreased by trapping hymenopteran parasitoids with yellow sticky traps. In both experiments, bottom-up manipulations had significant effects on gall density. Elevated salinity levels decreased the number of galls per 200 Borrichia stems, and fertilization increased the number of galls. In the salt-stress experiment, increased salinity decreased gall parasitism, and in the fertilization experiment, fertilizer increased parasitism of galls, but the direct effects of these treatments on gall density outweighed the indirect effects mediated by parasitoids. Parasitoid-removal treatments resulted in only small (and not statistically significant) changes in gall parasitism in the salt-stress experiment, and there was no significant effect on gall density. In the fertilization experiment, parasitoid-removal treatments reduced parasitism of, galls, and this resulted in an increase in gall density over time. Thus,,bottom-up effects were strong and consistent in both experiments, but top-down effects appeared weaker and inconsistent. Stem morphology, which was altered by salt and fertilizer, also affected gall density and parasitism, and there was some evidence that the strength of top-down forces on gall density varied with stem type. The results of this study show that, in this system, top-down effects of parasitism are dependent upon the bottom-up effects of host plant quality and morphology resulting from abiotic heterogeneity. As such, the relative importance of top-down effects can change depending upon the relative nutrient supply or salinity of the environment.

AB Stable nitrogen isotope ratios of whole organisms and tissues are routinely used in studies of trophic relationships and nitrogen flow through ecosystems, yet changes underlying increases in delta(15)N from food source to consumer are not completely understood. In this study, the delta(15)N of 16 amino acids in marine planktonic consumers and their food sources were examined using gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry of their N-pivaloyl-i-propyl-amino acid ester derivatives. Moderate increases in bulk delta(15)N with trophic position reflect an averaging of large increases in the delta(15)N of some amino acids, and little or no change in others. Amino acids showing consistently large increases (e.g., glutamic acid changes by similar to7%,, between food and consumer) provide greater scope for defining trophic position than the smaller isotopic changes in bulk material. In contrast, amino acids like phenylalanine show no change in delta(15)N with trophic position and therefore preserve information about nitrogen sources at the base of the food web. The ability to acquire information about both trophic level and nitrogen sources at the base of the food web from single samples of consumer tissues offers a powerful new tool for elucidating pathways of N transfer through food webs.

AB Studies of take ecosystems generally focus on pelagic food chains and processes. Recently, there has been an emerging recognition of the importance of benthic production and processes to whole-lake ecosystems. To examine the extent to which zoo-benthos contribute to higher trophic level production in lakes, we synthesized diet data from 470 fish populations (15 species) and stable isotope data from 90 fish Populations ( I I species), all of which are common inhabitants of north-temperate lakes. Across all species considered, zoobenthos averaged 50% of total prey consumption. Indirect consumption of zoobenthos (i.e., feeding on zoobenthos-supported fishes) contributed another 15%, for a total of 65% reliance on benthic secondary production. Stable isotopes provided estimates of mean zoobenthivory ranging from 43% to 59%. For most fish species. consumption of zoobenthos was highly variable among populations. The overwhelming concern of ecologists with pelagic food chains and processes contrasts sharply with our finding that benthic secondary production plays a central role in supporting higher trophic level production. This extensive zoobenthivory can subsidize fish populations, leading to apparent competition and otherwise altering trophic dynamics and ecosystem processes in the pelagic zone. We argue for a more integrated view of lake ecosystems that recognizes the duality of benthic and pelagic production pathways. Food web models that explicitly consider energy flow from pelagic and benthic sources will provide a more realistic energy flow template for understanding the regulation of lake ecosystem functioning.

AB Resource subsidies from external habitats can enhance the performance or population density of local consumers, altering their effects on in situ prey. Indirect effects of subsidies may be either positive or negative depending on the behavior of the shared consumer. Here we document strong links between riverine insects, riparian lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis), and terrestrial invertebrates. We hypothesized that aquatic insects subsidize riparian lizard populations leading to higher growth rates of these lizards in near-river habitats, and that subsidies exert short-term positive effects on terrestrial resources as a result of diet shifts by lizards to aquatic insects. To test these hypotheses, we used 2 m high fences, or "subsidy shields," to experimentally reduce aquatic insect flux to large (91 m 2) enclosures of lizards. Subsidy shields reduced aquatic insect flux by 55-65%. Growth rates of lizards were 7X higher in subsidized (no-shield) enclosures during the early summer but were not significantly different later in the summer, when ambient fluxes of aquatic insects dropped to 20% of their early season levels. Within the watershed, lizard growth rates (in mass) were positively correlated with the numerical abundance of aquatic insects. Thus, lizard growth rates tracked both seasonal and spatial availability of riverine insect subsidies during our experiment. Subsidies also had indirect effects on the ground-dwelling, terrestrial prey of lizards. Declines of diurnal terrestrial invertebrates Were significantly higher in shield than no-shield enclosures, and the most common ground spider (Arctosa sp. [Lycosidae]) disappeared completely from shield enclosures by the end of the experiment. Declines in terrestrial invertebrate abundance did not differ between no-shield enclosures and lizard exclosures. These data suggest that riverine insects subsidize riparian Sceloporus and, in the short term, reduce their predation on terrestrial arthropods.

AB Work to date has established that consumers are constrained in their chemical content variability. Such a constraint generates many different kinds of ecological relationships ranging from aspects of animal mineral nutrition to factors affecting consumer-driven nutrient recycling. Although previous studies have shown variation in zooplankton nutrient content within and between taxa, most stoichiometric studies assume that consumers are homeostatic in their elemental composition. In this paper, this assumption is reexamined as we describe the variability in the elemental content of the calanoid copepod Mixodiaptomus laciniatus Lilljeborg throughout its ontogeny (interstage variability) and for its specific developmental stages (intrastage variability). Mean copepod carbon content as dry mass increased significantly during ontogeny from 36.3% in nauplii to 51.5% in immature copepodites and 55.8% in adults. Mean phosphorus content decreased from 0.98% in nauplii to 0.87% in immature copepodites and 0.51% in adults. The copepod molar C:N:P ratio was 99:3:1 for nauplii, 165:13:1 for immature copepodites, and 234:25:1 for adults. These ontogenetic variations in stoichiometry within a single copepod species are comparable to the previously described range between taxa. Stoichiometric and physiological approaches are used as complementary tools to explain the two-part life history strategy of this copepod. First, the nauplii and early copepodite stages (CI-CIV) with high carbon demands adopt a growth strategy during which carbon sources are mainly allocated to increases in body size. The susceptibility of these copepodite stages to carbon limitation is reflected in the decline in the carbon content for a given stage (e.g., from 66% to 38% C in CII) and in the 40-fold decrease in neutral-to-polar lipid ratio toward the end of the ice-free season, suggesting a mobilization of food reserves toward growth. In contrast, copepodite stage C V and adults with less carbon demands for growth followed a survival-reproductive strategy, where the invariability in carbon content as dry mass (near 60%) and in neutral-to-polar lipid ratio through time indicates no accumulation of storage lipids, but instead an allocation of resources toward maintenance or reproduction. The basic assumption of predictions of stoichiometric models that elemental composition remains constant with time are not supported by changes in the intrastage carbon and nitrogen contents of Mixodiaptomus laciniatus. Thus, we suggest that the idea of strict homeostasis may be replaced with the concept of rheostasis, which allows the homeostatic regulatory mechanisms of an organism to adjust to a changing environment over time.

AB Linking species and ecosystems is currently one of the great challenges in ecology. To this end, we assess here the contributions of bacteria, fungi, and detritivorous invertebrates (shredders) to leaf litter breakdown, a key ecosystem-level process. We enclosed alder (Alnus glutinosa) and willow (Salix fragilis) leaves in coarse-mesh bags (5 g dry mass), placed them in a stream during peak leaf fall, and retrieved them periodically to determine leaf mass remaining and the biomass of leaf-associated organisms, Shredder biomass was derived from numbers and length-mass relationships, bacterial numbers and biomass were determined by epifluorescence microscopy, and fungal biomass was measured as ergosterol. In addition, conidial production of aquatic hyphomycetes was determined. Leaves decomposed rapidly with exponential breakdown coefficients k of 0.035 d(=1) (alder) and 0.027 d(-1) (willow). Leaves were also quickly colonized within the first 4 wk of decomposition, when shredder biomass reached 263 and 141 mg dry mass/litter bag, respectively. Maximum bacterial numbers (5.6 and 4.8 X 10(10) g(-1) detrital dry mass) were attained after 8 wk and corresponded to a biomass of 3.6 (alder) and 3.1 (willow) mg dry mass/g, <5% of the maximum fungal biomass (77 and 70 mg dry mass/g, respectively), Aquatic hyphomycetes released up to 2.7 and 1.4 X 10(6) conidia-g(-1).d(-1), equivalent to a daily conidial production of 9.4 and 2.9 mg dry mass/g on alder and willow, respectively. Calculations L based on the measured decomposer biomass and conidial production, published microbial Growth efficiencies, turnover times, and shredder feeding rates indicate that shredders accounted for the largest portion of overall leaf mass loss (64% and 51% on alder and willow leaves, respectively), fungi contributed at least 15% and 18% and bacterial contribution also was estimated to be substantial (7% and 9%. Analyses of elemental flows from allochthonous leaf litter thus clearly require a quantitative consideration of the Complex decomposer consortium responsible for leaf decomposition.

AB Many apparently generalized species are in fact composed of individual specialists that use a small subset of the population's resource distribution. Niche variation is usually established by testing the null hypothesis that individuals draw from a common resource distribution. This approach encourages a publication bias in which negative results are rarely reported, and obscures variation in the degree of individual specialization, limiting our ability to carry out comparative studies of the causes or consequences of niche variation. To facilitate studies of the degree of individual specialization, this paper outlines four quantitative indices of intrapopulation variation in resource use. Traditionally, such variation has been measured by partitioning the population's total niche width into within- and between-individual, sex, or phenotype components. We suggest two alternative measures that quantify the mean resource overlap between an individual and its population, and we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of all four measures. The utility of all indices depends on the quality of the empirical data. If resources are measured in a coarse-grained manner, individuals may falsely appear generalized. Alternatively, specialization may be overestimated by cross-sectional sampling schemes where diet variation can reflect a patchy environment. Isotope ratios, parasites, or diet-morphology correlations can complement cross-sectional data to establish temporal consistency of individual specialization.

AB The long-standing interest in density dependence in demographic rates of organisms stems from its influence in bounding population fluctuations and in shaping spatial patterns of abundance. Despite growing evidence that early mortality of marine reef fishes can be density dependent and can involve predation, the underlying biological mechanisms have not as yet been fully explored in any system. Here we examine the causes of density-dependent juvenile mortality for two tropical damselfishes,. Dascyllus flavicaudus and D. trimaculatus. These species shelter in branching corals or anemones, and they feed on plankton above their microhabitats during the day.
   Field experiments confirmed that density-dependent juvenile mortality of both Dascyllus species arouse from predation and that most of the density-dependent loss could be attributed to small-bodied, resident piscivores (e.g.,. sandperch, squirrelfish) rather than larger, transient species (e.g., jacks). Over the diel cycle,. mortality was strongly density dependent during the dark when damselfish were sheltering but not during daylight when fish were actively foraging. Infrared video recordings revealed the species of predators responsible for most losses and indicated that most predatory events occurred from late twilight to early night, when damselfishes were in shelters and not feeding. Individuals were most at risk when located near or just outside the perimeter of a shelter. The proportion of a cohort in the riskiest areas of a microhabitat increased with density. The cause of the increased fraction of individuals at risk with increasing density was intraspecific interactions among sheltering fish jostling for space in the safest regions; this resulted in the displacement of less aggressive individuals to riskier locations. Thus, density-dependent mortality in both damselfishes arose from interference competition for refuge space from crepuscular and nocturnal predators.

AB Among the most important trade-offs in life history evolution is whether to grow larger at the cost of longer development time, or to develop more rapidly at the cost of reduced size. For insect herbivores, resolution of this trade-off is thought to be strongly influenced by feeding ecology and mortality risks. In contrast, how these factors might affect the developmental strategies of third trophic level organisms, like parasitoid wasps, is less understood. To address this question, we compared the development of larval endoparasitoids in the families Ichneumonidae and Braconidae that parasitize larval stage herbivores in the order Lepidoptera. The campoplegine ichneumonid Venturia canescens parasitized concealed hosts and exhibited a developmental strategy that favored progeny size over development time. In contrast, the closely related ichneumonid Campoletis sonorensis parasitized exposed hosts and exhibited the opposite strategy of favoring rapid development time over size. The microgastrine braconid Microplitis croceipes attacks partially concealed hosts and showed evidence of a trade-off between maximizing body size and minimizing development times. These results suggested that parasitoids attacking apparent, foliar-feeding hosts may favor rapid development time over size while parasitoids that attack concealed hosts favor size over development time. A broader survey of the literature supported the trends found in our experimental studies. The braconids and ichneumonids examined in this study also exhibit distinct differences in larval feeding and pupation behavior. These developmental traits did not appear to affect the size-development time continuum. However, these traits may affect the size range of hosts that larval endoparasitoids can successfully exploit.

AB In periphyton communities, autotrophic algae and prokaryotes live in close spatial proximity to heterotrophic components such as bacteria and micro- and meiofauna. In factorial field experiments, we manipulated grazer access and nutrient supply to periphyton communities and measured the effects on algal, ciliate, meiofaunal, and bacterial biomass. We tested whether grazing macrozoobenthos affects all periphytic components (generalist consumption), whether nutrient effects propagate through the community, and whether interactions between the different periphyton groups allow for indirect feedback mechanisms. The experiments were conducted during three different seasons in a mesoeutrophic lake in Sweden (Lake Erken) and at an adjacent coastal marine site (Vaddo) of similar productivity, but with contrasting grazer fauna. We found strong direct effects of nutrients and grazing on algae at both sites. Algal biomass increased in fertilized treatments and was significantly reduced when grazers were present. The algae clearly dominated the system quantitatively and were positively correlated to the biomass of ciliates and meiofauna. The effects of grazing and nutrients were more complex for heterotrophs than for algae. Generally, the presence of grazers tended to increase the biomass of bacteria, ciliates, and meiofauna. Thus, macrograzers were not generalist consumers of the entire community, but mainly reduced algae. Furthermore, the results suggested strong indirect effects of grazing, presumably through changes in nutrient supply and algal size structure. Nutrient enrichment had weak and inconsistent effects on bacterial, ciliate, and meiofaunal biomass. There was thus no complete propagation of bottom-up effects through the community, and strong internal feedback mechanisms within the periphyton mediated the effects of macroconsumers and nutrient enrichment.

AB Ecologists utilize laboratories, mesocosms, and field environments as the settings for their experiments. However, the ways in which these venues influence experimental outcomes remain poorly understood. I tested the effect of experimental venue by conducting parallel manipulations in mesocosms and in the field. A target-neighbor experiment estimating the impact of larval wood frog (Rana sylvatica) density on the performance of spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer) larvae was carried out in a set of artificial pond mesocosms and within mesh enclosures placed in natural ponds. Larvae of P. crucifer suffered sharp reductions in growth and development in the presence of increasing R. sylvatica densities when reared in mesocosms, but showed no response in field enclosures. A comparative test suggested that mesocosms yielded relatively unrealistic responses. These findings demonstrate that, apart from other considerations such as spatial scale, experimental venue can alter conclusions regarding interactions between species. If venue dependence is widespread, ecologists will need to strategically assess the choice of venue when considering the goals of their experiments.

AB Although area, species abundances, spatial distribution, and species richness have been central components of community ecology, their interrelationships are not completely understood. To describe these interrelationships, we study and test three patterns regarding species richness using species-area models. The first one is the widely accepted generalization that states that the number of species monotonically increases with sampling area. The second pattern predicts the decrease in species richness with the increase of species dominance in a given area. The third one predicts that spatial aggregation of individuals within species results in lower species richness in communities. These three generalizations were investigated by modeling and simulations. First, a random-placement species-area model was used to evaluate the effects of relative species abundances on species richness in a sampling area, Then, a nonrandom species-area model was derived which explicitly encompasses the spatial distributions of species; it served to evaluate the effects of heterogeneity in spatial distributions on species richness. Species-area models were numerically evaluated using parameters estimated from a tropical rain forest community, and simulations were conducted to support the numerical solutions. The three patterns regarding species diversity were consistently supported by the results. A discussion ensues, describing how the three patterns can be used to interpret and predict species diversity, and how they are supported by other diversity hypotheses. The three generalizations suggest that, if we want to understand species diversity, we should go and look for mechanisms that influence the abundances and spatial distributions of species. If a mechanism can make the species abundances more even, or their spatial distributions more regular, this factor likely contributes to species coexistence.

AB We studied a temperate plant community to examine whether the reproductive phenology of ant-dispersed plants is correlated with seasonal variation in seed dispersal activity of ants. We documented flowering and fruiting peak of 24 ant-disperscd and 251 non-ant-dispersed plant species. To characterize the activity of ants, we quantified the seasonal removal rates of greater celandine (Chelidonium majus) seeds. Ant-dispersed plants flowered on average 5.6 wk and fruited 7.1 wk earlier than those with other dispersal modes. This difference was not caused by variation in growth form or habitat. Mean fruiting peak of ant-dispersed plants was early July. Ant activity was especially high between May and July. The results indicate that ant-dispersed plants would have suffered a significant decline in seed removal if they had fruited at times when plant,, with other dispersal modes fruited. Thus, our data suggest that the early phenology of ant-dispersed plants is an adaptation to their mode of seed dispersal.

AB We used a probabilistic approach to address the influence of sampling artifacts on the form of species-area relationships (SARs). We developed a model in which the increase in observed species richness is a function of sampling effort exclusively. We assumed that effort depends on area sampled, and we generated species-area curves under that model. These curves can be realistic looking. We then generated SARs from avian data, comparing SARs based on counts with those based on richness estimates. We used an approach to estimation of species richness that accounts for species detection probability and, hence, for variation in sampling effort, The slopes of SARs based on counts are steeper than those of curves based on estimates of richness, indicating that the former partly reflect failure to account for species detection probability. SARs based on estimates reflect ecological processes exclusively, not sampling processes. This approach permits investigation of ecologically relevant hypotheses. The slope of SARs is not influenced by the slope of the relationship between habitat diversity and area. In situations in which not all of the species are detected during sampling sessions, approaches to estimation of species richness integrating species detection probability should be used to investigate the rate of increase in species richness with area.

AB Simplification of natural habitats is a growing global concern demanding that ecologists better understand how habitat heterogeneity influences the structure and functioning of ecosystems. While there is extensive evidence that physical habitat heterogeneity affects the structure of biotic communities (i.e., organismal abundance, distribution, diversity, etc.), ecologists know little about how variability in physical conditions within habitats regulates ecological processes that are important for the functioning of all ecosystem. We performed a field experiment to assess the effects of geomorphic heterogeneity (i.e., variation in substrate size) on rates of benthic productivity and respiration at the scale of whole riffle habitats in a stream ecosystem. While holding median sizes constant, we manipulated variation in the size of stream bed sediments in replicate riffles to create two treatments representing increased and decreased levels of physical habitat heterogeneity relative to natural conditions in the stream. Physical habitat heterogeneity had an immediate and significant impact on the primary productivity of stream algae and oil the respiration of the benthic biofilm. The rates of both ecological processes were elevated in the high-heterogeneity riffles, probably as a result of quantified alterations to near-bed flow velocity and turbulence intensity. Results presented here provide Support for the widely held, but largely untested, assumption that physical habitat heterogencity exhibits control over ecosystem-level processes, and it suggests that human-induced simplification of habitats may indeed be altering the functioning of ecosystems.

AB Because male distribution and abundance strongly influence female fertilization success, density-dependent selection might act on gamete traits to maximize reproductive success. Intra- and interspecific variation in female fertilization success was investigated in the sea urchins Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, S. franciscanus, and S. droebachiensis. Male and female urchins of each species were induced to spawn within 25-m(2) plots. The percentage of eggs fertilized, along with six covariates (male density, male-female distance, number of males, surge velocity, advection, and water depth), was measured for each spawning event. S. purpuratus had the highest levels of fertilization (94%), followed by S. franciscanus (64%) and S. droebachiensis (23%). The species with the highest densities, most males, and closest neighbors had the highest levels of fertilization. Depth and surge were not significant factors, but advection was associated with fertilization negatively in S. purpuratus and positively in S. drocbachiensis. This interaction is probably caused by the higher degree of clumping in S. purpuratus than in S. droebachiensis. An analysis of covariance indicates that the rank order of least-squares means of percentage fertilization for these three species is the opposite of that for the uncorrected species means. S. droebachiensis performs best and S. purpuratus performs worst, when conditions arc held equal. These differences in performance can best be explained by gamete traits. Additional experiments determined (1) that the 25-m(2) plot Size is the appropriate scale for investigation of patterns of fertilization in S. franciscanus, the species with the largest contiguous populations; (2) that S. purpuratus, the species commonly found in the intertidal and subtidal zones, had similarly high levels of fertilization in the two locations; and (3) that fertilization success in the experimental plots was similar to that during natural spawning events. These results are consistent with density-dependent selection on gamete traits. Gametes of the species that naturally occurs at the lowest population density and has the lowest natural fertilization rates have attributes that cause them to perform the best of the three under conditions of sperm limitation, and those of the species that occurs at the highest densities and has the highest levels of natural fertilization perform most efficiently under conditions of sperm competition. Historical demographic conditions appear to have resulted in selection on gamete traits to maximize reproductive success under conditions of either sperm limitation or sperm competition.

AB Traits that confer plant resistance to some herbivore species but increase plant susceptibility to other herbivore species are said to carry an "ecological cost" of herbivore resistance. The native perennial, Datura wrightii, is dimorphic for leaf trichome type, and the production of glandular trichomes carries a potential ecological cost over the production of nonglandular trichomes. Glandular trichomes provide resistance to at least six herbivore species, but they also confer susceptibility to Tupiocoris notatus, an abundant mirid bug with special adaptations to glandular trichomes. We estimated herbivore-specific damage to plants of each trichome type and measured plant seed production, a component of fitness, in a common garden over three years. Plant seed production increased with the size and persistence of leaf canopies and occasionally declined with increasing damage caused by some of the defoliating insects. Plant seed production was never reduced by T. notatus damage, however. Even though the ecological cost of glandular trichome production was not apparent in D. wrightii, the trait still was not beneficial. The fitness of plants with glandular trichomes never exceeded that of plants with nonglandular trichomes despite variation in both the composition of the herbivore community and the total level of damage inflicted by herbivores over three years of study. The persistence of the allele coding for, glandular trichomes cannot be explained solely on the basis of the herbivore resistance that those trichomes provide.

AB Life history theory predicts a trade-off between current reproduction and survival to maximize fitness. In long-lived seabirds. one might expect adults not to jeopardize survival by excessive reproductive investment when environmental conditions for breeding are adverse. Some environmental factors have reduced the fecundity of Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) breeding in Shetland, UK, a metapopulation that has declined substantially during the last two decades. Two hypotheses are proposed to explain this decrease: (1) reduced availability of sandeels (the main prey for kittiwakes), which has occurred since the late 1980s; and (2) increased predation by Great Skuas (Catharacta skua), the main predator of kittiwakes. Detailed data on food supply (sandeel stock size, by age groups), kittiwake body condition and breeding success, and diet and productivity of Great Skuas allowed us to assess the influence of each of these factors on adult kittiwake survival from 1986 through 1997. Capture-recapture models were constructed to examine correlations between local adult survival rate and environmental parameters. Body condition at the end of the breeding season and availability of 0-group (juveniles less than or equal to I yr old) sandeels positively influenced adult survival, whereas survival was lower when Great Skua productivity was high. Adult survival varied greatly during the study, from 0.53 +/- 0.04 to 0.98 +/- 0.01 (mean +/- I SD), and was independent of sex. Both hypotheses were supported. Contrary to predictions of life history theory, kittiwakes did not refrain from breeding in years of poor food supply or high predator activity to buffer their survival at the cost of not rearing chicks. Although 0-group sandeel availability affected breeding success of kittiwakes, its influence on adult survival was also significant. The discovery that food supply affects adult survival rate has important implications for fisheries management to minimize impacts on seabirds.

AB Ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B; 280-320 nm) penetrates some aquatic habitats to biologically significant depths and can alter life histories of aquatic organisms, including algae, zooplankton, fish, and amphibians. Although major species differences have been documented for UV-B sensitivity, few studies have examined differences between populations of the same species. Previous work has suggested the hypothesis that larval long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) from valley populations (similar to100 m elevation) were more sensitive to UV-B exposure than larvae from mountain populations (above 500 m elevation). To test this hypothesis in the absence of possible other confounding environmental effects, we brought early-stage embryos into the laboratory from three valley populations and five mountain populations from Oregon and Washington and raised them under identical conditions without UV-B for two months after hatching. Larvae from each population were then placed under UV-B lighting, and we recorded their growth and survivorship for three weeks. Larvae from all populations had higher mortality when exposed to UV-B than when shielded from UV-B. However, individuals from low-elevation populations exposed to UV-B had significantly lower survivorship than did those from high-elevation populations, suggesting an elevational difference in UV-B sensitivity. In all populations, individuals exposed to U-V-B were smaller than shielded individuals after one week. If UV-B is a factor in determining the long-term persistence of some amphibian species, an understanding of within-species variation is critical.

AB Differences in initial large-scale disturbances might change effects of subsequent large-scale disturbances. We explored possible effects of prior fire regimes on subsequent hurricane-related mortality of south Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii var. densa) in remnant Everglades pine savannas that were unburned, burned during the wet (lightning fire) season, or burned during the dry (anthropogenic fire) season in the decade before Hurricane Andrew (1992). We measured direct mortality during Andrew (snapped trees) and extended mortality over the subsequent 24-30 mo (mainly insect attacks on damaged trees). We used Bayesian model averaging to obtain probabilities of different models of survival based on fire regime and site characteristics (remnant area, distance to the Atlantic Ocean, depth to water table in the dry season, sustained wind speeds, tree sizes). Most likely models for direct and extended mortality included large negative effects of tree size and dry-season fire regime, and positive effects of stand, area (direct mortality) and wet-season fire regime (extended mortality). Depth to water table and distance to the ocean had less certain effects. Our results, not predicted from fires or hurricanes alone, suggest that anthropogenic changes to dry-season fires strongly influence the effects of subsequent hurricanes on the mortality of pines in subtropical savannas.

AB To investigate synchronized annual fluctuation of seed production and its advantage for regeneration at the community level, for nine years (1987-1995) we monitored the flowering, seed production, and seedling emergence of the 16 principal tree species in a temperate deciduous forest, Ogawa Forest Reserve, in central Japan.
   We found that the species with higher synchronized flowering within a population had larger fluctuation of annual seed production at the population level. The coefficient of concordance of flowering and the coefficient of variation of annual seed production were continuously distributed among species, making it difficult to distinguish masting from nonmasting species. The annual seed production patterns of the 16 species were classified, by cluster analysis, into groups that synchronize their fluctuation of annual seed production. This analysis showed a highly synchronized annual seed production, not only among congeneric species, but also among species of different families.
   Although our results have some insufficiency of statistical significance, they did show that predator satiation, both in a population and a guild, effectively operated for many species to enhance seed survival at the pre-dispersal stage. They also showed that pollination efficiency was likely to be operating at the population level for half of the wind-pollinating species. However, generalist predator satiation at the postdispersal seed stage may not operate in a simple, detectable manner in this species-rich forest community.
   It is highly probable that there are combined effects of several factors: limited weather triggers for flowering, common flowering physiology among taxonomically related species, and the ecological advantages at the population and guild levels, may cause multiple species to have synchronized fluctuation patterns of seed production.

AB Although invasion has long been recognized as an important ecological process, there are very few experimental studies of invasion in natural communities and virtually no studies that determine how trophic structure affects the probability of invasion, We introduced novel protozoans and rotifers into the natural communities found in the water-filled leaves of the pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea. The communities were manipulated in a factorial design of removal of predators (larvae of the mosquito Wyeomyia smithii) and addition of resources (dead insects). Three of the six protozoan species successfully established populations when introduced into pitchers, suggesting that these species are migration limited. The other three protozoans and a rotifer did not successfully invade established communities, although all four are naturally found in these inquiline communities. Of the three successfully invading protozoans, two were more likely to invade when resources were added and one of those even more frequently when predators were removed. Invasion by the third was unaffected by these experimental manipulations. Similar effects of predators and resources were found on population sizes of these three species. This study is one of very few that have addressed invasion experimentally; its results suggest that a variety of factors, including migration, predation, and resource availability, can have different influences on invasion by fairly similar protozoans.

AB I assessed the differential effects of water availability on aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and decomposition along a natural rainfall gradient ranging from 500 to 5500 mm mean annual precipitation (MAP). All sites were native forest vegetation on the island of Hawai'i, at similar elevation and of similar substrate age. Measurements of production were conducted for 12 months, with monthly collections of litterfall, biannual measurement of tree diameter increase, and nondestructive measures of grass production. Aboveground net primary production increased linearly with increasing site rainfall in the first four sites (up to 2000 mm MAP) and then declined at the wettest site. Grass production was a small component of total ANPP at the two driest Sites and was absent elsewhere. When compared with decomposition of surface litter along the same gradient, patterns of ANPP were distinct from those of rates of mass loss and nutrient release. The balance between production and decomposition was illustrated with a simple model that predicted changes in detrital mass and nutrient content and concentration of detritus along the precipitation gradient. The change in the relative effect on these two processes along the gradient of precipitation suggests a complexity to the regional control of rainfall on ecosystem functioning that could not be seen when examining a single process alone.

AB Theory on costs of plant defense against herbivory in stressful environments predicts that costs should increase when competition is intense. This amplifies a fundamental dilemma that plants are thought to face: allocate limited resources to grow fast enough to compete, or invest these resources in secondary metabolites to maintain defense. We studied costs associated with genetic and environmental variation in secondary metabolite production of Brassica rapa in the presence and absence of the generalist competitor Lolium perenne. We used experimental quantitative genetics (artificial selection) to manipulate genetic variation, and herbivore-induction treatments to produce environmental variation in myrosinase and glucosinolate concentrations and resistance. Glucosinolates, and their byproducts after break-down by myrosinase, are known to affect herbivory on plants in the Brassicaceae family. Defense costs were significant in the absence of competitors, but in contrast to theoretical predictions, costs of constitutive defense (measured as growth rates) were not detectable and the cost of induced defense remained the same in the competitive environment. To understand what factors made constitutive defense costs not detectable under competition we conducted several experiments to assess the effects of limited resources and allelopathy on costs and benefits of the defense chemicals. None of the experiments involving nutrient supply and weak competition supported the hypothesis that the lack of defense costs in competitive environments was due to limited resources. Instead, the breakdown products of the glucosinolate-myrosinase reaction appeared to function as allelopathic agents, which may benefit B. rapa plants in competition, thereby reducing net costs of chemical defense. We found that: (1) the effects of exogenous glucosinolates on Lolium root length depended on the presence of myrosinase. (2) In the absence of nutrients, Lolium root lengths were shorter when seeds germinated with B. rapa. (3) Genetic increases in glucosinolate concentration negatively affected Lolium seedling growth only when there were simultaneous genetic increases in myrosinase concentration. Activated carbon treatments designed to neutralize allelopathic effects and restore costs in the competitive environments were, however, not statistically significant. When plant defenses also function to benefit plants in competitive interactions, plants may evolve to compete and defend.

AB Arboreal frugivores. such as primates and hornbills, are important seed dispersers for many tropical plant species, yet the degree to which they use the same resources is unknown. If primates and hornbills consume the same fruit species. they may be redundant in their roles as seed dispersers. and the loss of one of these taxa may be compensated for by the other. To examine resource use by tropical frugivores, we quantified the feeding habits of two hornbill species. Ceratogymna atrata and C. cylindricus, and five primate species, Colobus guereza, Lophocebus albigena, Cercopithecus pogonias, C. cephus, and C. nictitans, in the lowland rainforest of south-central Cameroon. Based on over 2200 feeding observations recorded between January and December 1998, we characterized the diets and estimated dietary overlap among frugivore species. Previous studies have calculated dietary overlap by counting the number of diet species that two animals share. often leading to inflated estimates of overlap. Our method incorporated the proportional use of diet species and fruit availability into randomization procedures, allowing a clearer assessment of the actual degree of overlap. This added complexity of analysis revealed that, although the diets of a hornbill and a primate species may have as many as 36 plant species in common, actual dietary overlap is low. These results suggested that there are distinct hornbill and primate feeding assemblages. with primates consuming a greater diversity of plant species and higher levels of nonfruit items like leaves and seeds. Using Correspondence Analysis, we also identified two primate assemblages, separated largely by degree of frugivory and folivory. In addition, we found that hornbills feed at significantly higher strata in the forest canopy and eat fruits of different colors than primates. Averaged across the year. overlap between groups (hornbill-primate) was significantly lower than combined within-group overlap (primate-primate and hornbill-hornbill). showing that primates and hornbills have dissimilar diets and are not redundant as seed dispersers. In equatorial Africa, primate populations face greater declines than hornbill populations because of hunting. It is unlikely that seed dispersal by hornbills will compensate for the loss of primates in maintaining forest structure.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dominates the flux of organic matter in most stream ecosystems, but the proportion susceptible to microbial degradation is often presumed to be low. The fraction of bulk DOC contributing to microbial metabolism was assessed in five streams representing the regional range in surface-water DOC concentration in eastern New York State, USA (range 0.5-7.7 mg/L; n = 82). Transects of shallow wells along two hyporheic flowpaths (i.e., saturated sediments found below and lateral to the open-stream channel in active exchange with surface waters) in each of five streams were sampled monthly at baseflow to determine changes in subsurface DOC and dissolved oxygen concentrations. Hyporheic DOC concentrations ranged from 50% to 100% of surface-water concentrations and decreased along hyporheic flowpaths in four of five streams. Dissolved oxygen losses along hyporheic flowpaths paralleled DOC loss, and bacterial activity on tiles incubated at points along the flowpaths generally declined as hyporheic DOC was depleted. DOC losses along natural flowpaths exceeded the quantity of DOC lost during laboratory bottle incubations, even when samples were amended with inorganic nutrients. Hyporheic mesocosms were used to examine the fate of stream-derived DOC along replicated flowpaths under controlled hydrologic conditions. The overall patterns of DOC losses along mesocosm flowpaths supplied with water from previously studied. streams were similar to DOC losses along natural flowpaths. DOC declines were paralleled by declines in bacterial activity and dissolved oxygen. Mesocosm results indicated that variation in percentage of DOC loss along natural flowpaths was not a function of dilution, residence time, or initial DOC concentration and-that subsurface DOC dynamics were linked to variation in microbial metabolism.
   The fraction of total. DOC available for metabolism varied markedly among regional streams and was independent of initial DOC concentration. DOC near the end of hyporheic flowpaths was not subject to further degradation, regardless of the bioavailability of surface-water DOC entering these flowpaths. Hence, in streams with significant hyporheic exchange, the amount and bioavailability of DOC transported to downstream ecosystems may be affected by subsurface metabolism. DOC depletion during hyporheic transport may provide a general in situ measure of bioavailable DOC in surface water and be a powerful predictor of rates of heterotrophic activity in sediments at the reach level.

AB Little attention has been given to indirect nontarget effects of classical biological control, those effects that do not involve control agents directly attacking nontarget species. We combined experiments, theory, and historical information to show that the decline of a native parasitoid, Praon pequodorum Viereck (Braconidae: Hymenoptera), in alfalfa cropping systems may be caused by competition with Aphidius ervi Haliday (Braconidae: Hymenoptera), an exotic parasitoid introduced as a biological control agent of pea aphids. We conducted studies to examine competition for hosts at the population and plant levels, compare parasitoid searching behaviors, and model the interactions between two parasitoids on their single host. At the population level, P. pequodorum achieved relatively higher parasitism than A. ervi when the overall level of parasitism (and hence competition) was higher; this is explained by P. pequodorum's superior within-host competitive ability. A negative correlation between A. ervi and P. pequodorum parasitism per plant suggested strong competition by larvae within hosts or behavioral avoidance of previously parasitized hosts by P. pequodorum. Comparison of searching behavior revealed that A. ervi is a superior among-host competitor, searching longer on a plant after an aphid is encountered, moving more rapidly within plants, and attacking and parasitizing more aphids per unit time than P. pequodorum. Using a simple model, we show that high searching efficiency such as that exhibited by A. ervi could lead it to extirpate a superior larval competitor such as P. pequodorum. This competitive exclusion is facilitated by severe or frequent disturbances (such as regular harvesting of alfalfa) that cause mortality of both hosts and parasitoids. Disturbances place a premium on searching efficiency that allows rapid parasitoid population growth. These findings suggest that indirect nontarget effects of biological control may depend on agricultural practices and the consequent disturbance regime of human-dominated systems.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) is a relatively short-lived trace gas that reacts with oxygen in the troposphere to produce the air pollutant ozone. It also reacts with water vapor to form nitric and nitrous acids, which acidify precipitation and increase N deposition. Models currently used to predict soil NO fluxes are based on the assumption that NO flux is proportional to the gross rate of nitrification or N mineralization; however, this assumption has not been tested because of the difficulty in measuring gross N-cycling rates in situ. We measured soil NO fluxes, gross and net N-cycling rates, and a variety of other soil characteristics in the forest floor and intact soil cores at nine undisturbed forest and rangeland ecosystems of New Mexico, Utah, and Oregon, USA, to determine which soil variables were most closely related to soil NO flux. Soil NO fluxes ranged from a low of 0.02 ng N.m(-1).s(-1), prior to wetting in a western hemlock-sitka spruce forest on the Ore-on coast, to a high of 6.74 ng N.m(-2).s(-1), one hour after soil wetting in a juniper woodland of central Oregon. In contrast to our expectations, neither gross nitrification nor gross mineralization was correlated with soil NO flux. Fluxes were positively correlated with net rates of mineralization and nitrification, soil NO(3) concentrations, bulk density, and pH. and negatively correlated with gross rates of NO(3) consumption in the forest floor, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil C:N, and soil water content. Principal-componeflt analysis showed that NO flux after water addition (2 cm of water) had a strong negative correlation with microbial demand for N (as indicated by net mineralization, net nitrification, SOC, and C:N). Our results suggest that, even in well-drained soils, NO efflux is limited more by NO consumption than by NO production. As a result, models utilizing the more easily measured net rates. rather than,ross rates, may be better predictors of soil NO fluxes across a range of ecosystems.

AB Continuous cultures of the green algae Selenastrum capricornutum were arown at different concentrations of total phosphorus ( 1-50 Lmol P/L) and different light levels (10-200 mumol quanta(.)m(-2.)s(-1)). Growth yields in terms of C, N, and P were positively correlated to total P level. Total biomasses in terms of C and N, but not P, were also positively correlated to light level. The cell quotas of C were positively correlated with light, whereas cell quotas of P were negatively correlated with light. The resulting elemental ratios gave a quite consistent pattern, where high light caused significant reductions in both N:C and P:C ratios, as well as strong reductions in chlorophyll to carbon ratios. The increase in P:C ratio with increasing total P and decreasing light can be interpreted as an adaptive response to self-shading. In that case, our results indicate that light adaptation not only involves a cost in terms of increased chlorophyll synthesis, but also in terms of increased P demands. This provides new insight not only into the physiological regulation of C and P uptake in algae, but it could also explain deviations from the Redfield ratio.
   The growth of juvenile Daphnia magna fed S. capricornutum from the different light and phosphorus treatments was studied in a series of short-term assays (7 d) covering a gradient of food concentrations. The response of Daphnia growth rate along this quantity (0.5-5.0 mg C/L) and quality (0.5-12 mug atomic P. [mg atomic C](-1)) gradient gave a close fit to a double hyperbola model. Changes in elemental ratios of the algae were reflected in the growth rate of Daphnia, such that up to 40% reduction in its growth rate could be attributed to increased C:P ratios. This study demonstrates that the physiological responses of phototrophs in terms of chlorophyll content and elemental composition depend strongly on ambient light and nutrient regimes. It also confirms that these patterns can yield contrasting responses on herbivore growth responses along the food quantity and quality axes.

AB Demographic matrix models are used to estimate the population Multiplication rate (finite rate of increase) of structured populations. When rates of transitions among age classes or stages (e.g., probabilities of growth or survival, fecundities) are estimated by tagging individuals, the number of individuals tagged from each Stage deter=Z mines the precision of the estimated transition rates, and hence the precision of the estimated population multiplication rate, (&lambda;) over cap. When there is a limit on the total number of individuals that can be tagged, tagging individuals at random does not produce the most precise estimate of (&lambda;) over cap possible.
   Here, using a linear approximation to the sampling variance of (&lambda;) over cap, I show how to calculate an allocation of taus among stages that provides a more precise estimate of (&lambda;) over cap than tagging individuals randomly. I illustrate this calculation with two examples, and show by simulation that stratified sampling based on this efficient sample composition can result in sizable increases in the precision of (&lambda;) over cap. The methods presented can also be used to compare the statistical efficiency of alternative sampling designs.

AB In ectotherms, lower mean temperatures and shorter growing seasons at higher latitudes would be expected to cause a reduction in the annual growth rate of an individual. If slower growth reduces fitness, then organisms at higher latitudes may evolve compensatory responses for these climatic effects. Two such forms of local adaptation with increasing latitude are possible: (1) the capacity for growth may shift to a lower range of temperatures (i.e., temperature adaptation) or (2) maximum growth rate may evolve inversely with length of the growing season (i.e., countergradient variation). A third alternative is a mixed strategy involving both of the above. We hypothesized that the form of local adaptation may be affected by constraints that vary within vs. among species. We used common-environment experiments to compare reaction norms for growth in response to temperature among local population., of two contiguous, closely related fish species, the Atlantic silverside, Menidia menidia (L.), and the tidewater silverside, M. peninsulae (Goode and Bean), which together ha,e a range spanning much of the North American Atlantic coast. The common-environment experiments revealed countergradient variation: maximum growth rate increased with latitude both within and among species. However. growth reaction norms of the northern species were shifted to a lower range of temperatures than those of the southern species, indicating adaptation to temperature at the interspecific level. Hence, adaptation to temperature contributes to the interspecific variation, while countergradient variation contributes to both the intra- and interspecific differences.

AB I used two methods to estimate limiting environmental temperatures for 28 North American passerine species studied in the physiological literature: indirect estimation from body mass and allometric equations, and direct estimation from physiological measurements of basal metabolic rate (BMR), lower critical temperature. and thermal conductance. I compared these predicted limiting temperatures to mean minimum temperatures at northern winter range boundaries determined from Christmas Bird Count data. Estimates derived from physiological parameters predicted minimum temperatures at range boundaries more accurately than did allometric equations. Phylogenetic analyses of independent contrasts under two branch length hypotheses corroborated that physiological parameters were superior to allometric equations as predictors of range boundary temperature. Thus using body mass as a surrogate for physiological data underestimates the association between physiological cold tolerance and northern range limits. However, this association Could be explained by phenotypic acclimatization to different environments as well as by genetic differences among species; thus low values of the physiological temperature limit may be a result rather than a cause of northerly ranges, The distribution of predicted metabolic rates at northern range boundaries relative to BMR did not cluster at a clear upper boundary, so it is uncertain whether a constraint on maximum metabolic rate limits distribution of some species. Metabolic rate at the northern range boundary was a smaller multiple Of BMR for insectivores than for non-insectivores, suggesting that food availability may limit winter ranges of insectivores, but analysis of independent contrasts did not verify this effect. The data do not indicate clearly whether the distribution of non-insectivorous bird species is limited by abiotic or biotic factors.

AB Optimal defense theory (ODT) predicts that plants should have the highest defense levels in parts that have the highest value in terms of fitness. Assumptions about differences in fitness value among plant parts have previously been based on general reasoning, e.g., that reproductive tissue is more valuable than vegetative tissue since fitness ultimately depends on reproduction. Here we present a first example of how demographic elasticity (proportional sensitivity) analysis can be used as a tool to generate more objective and specific estimates of the fitness value of different plant parts, based on the entire life cycle. These estimates were further used to generate testable predictions about intraplant variation in defenses of the brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum (knotted wrack). The predictions were clearly supported by the results from both analyses of chemical defense levels (phlorotannins) and bioassays (feeding preference experiments), which showed that reproductive tissues had the lowest defense level of the three examined tissue types, in contrast to previous assumptions. We suggest that a stronger focus on variation in life history among species and populations, with demographic perturbation analysis as one important tool, could lead to a better understanding of intraplant variation in defense levels, in seaweeds as well as vascular plants and other modular organisms.

AB Although many studies have documented the impact of invasive species on indigenous flora and fauna, few have rigorously examined interactions among invaders and the potential for one exotic species to replace another. European green crabs (Carcintus maenas), once common in rocky intertidal habitats of southern New England, have recently declined in abundance coincident with the invasion of the Asian shore crab (Hemigrapsus sanguineus). Over a four-year period in the late 1990s we documented a significant (40-90%) decline in green crab abundance and a sharp (10-fold) increase in H. sanguineus at three sites in southern New England. Small, newly recruited green crabs had a significant risk of predation when paired with larger H. sanguineus in the laboratory, and recruitment of 0-yr C. maenas was reduced by H. sanguineus as well as by larger conspecifics in field-deployed cages (via predation and cannibalism, respectively). In contrast, recruitment of 0-yr H. sanguineus was not affected by larger individuals of either crab species during the same experiments. The differential susceptibility of C. maenas and H. sanguineus recruits to predation and cannibalism likely contributed to the observed decrease in C. maenas abundance and the almost exponential increase in H. sanguineus abundance during the period of study.
   While the Asian shore crab is primarily restricted to rocky intertidal habitats, C. maenas is found intertidally, subtidally, and in a range of substrate types in New England. Thus, the apparent replacement of C. maenas by H. sanguineus in rocky intertidal habitats of southern New England may not ameliorate the economic and ecological impacts attributed to green crab populations in other habitats of this region. For example, field experiments indicate that predation pressure on a native bivalve species (Mytilus edulis) has not necessarily decreased with the declines of C. maenas. While H. sanguineus has weaker per capita effects than C. mamas, its densities greatly exceed those of C. maenas at present and its population-level effects are likely comparable to the past effects of C. maenas. The Carcinus-Hemigrapsus interactions documented here are relevant in other parts of the world where green crabs and grapsid crabs interact, particularly on the west coast of North America where C mamas has recently invaded and co-occurs with two native Hemigrapsus species.

AB Temporary emigration was identified some time ago as causing potential problems in capture-recapture studies, and in the last five years approaches have been developed for dealing with special cases of this general problem. Temporary emigration can be viewed more generally as involving transitions to and from an unobservable state, and frequently the state itself is one of biological interest (e.g., "nonbreeder"). Development of models that permit estimation of relevant parameters in the presence of an unobservable state requires either extra information (e.g., as supplied by Pollock's robust design) or the following classes of model constraints: reducing the order of Markovian transition probabilities, imposing a degree of determinism on transition probabilities, removing state specificity of survival probabilities, and imposing temporal constancy of parameters. The objective of the work described in this paper is to investigate estimability of model parameters under a variety of models that include an unobservable state. Beginning with a very general model and no extra information, we used numerical methods to systematically investigate the use of ancillary information and constraints to yield models that are useful for estimation. The result is a catalog of models for which estimation is possible. An example analysis of sea turtle capture-recapture data under two different models showed similar point estimates but increased precision for the model that incorporated ancillary data (the robust design) when compared to the model with deterministic transitions only. This comparison and the results of our numerical investigation of model structures lead to design suggestions for capture-recapture studies in the presence of an unobservable state.

AB We investigated the relationship between parasitoid attraction to herbivore-induced plant volatiles and larval parasitism rates of two closely related heliothine; noctuid moths. Heliothis subflexa Guenee is a specialist on plants in the genus Physalis, while Heliothis virescens Fabricius. is an extreme generalist. In North America, these species serve as the only known hosts for the specialist parasitoid Cardiochiles nigriceps Vierick; oviposition into Helicoverpa zea, a non-host, does occur but results in lethal encapsulation, of C. nigriceps' eggs,. Heliothis virescens larvae are parasitised by C. nigriceps far more frequently than are H. subflexa larvae. Parasitoid attraction to volatiles emitted by tobacco in response to herbivory by H. virescens has previously been demonstrated. Using field experiments, we examined the possibility that pre-detection defenses against parasitoid attraction to herbivore-induced plant volatiles are responsible for H. subflexa's relatively low rates of parasitism by C. nigriceps.
   Herbivore-damaged plants were significantly more attractive to C. nigriceps than were larvae, larval frass, larval saliva, or damaged leaves alone. Plant species affected parasitoid attraction: tobacco was the most preferred plant species, followed by Physalis angulata, and then cotton. The parasitoid was also more attracted to host species (H. subflexa and H. virescens) than to the non-host species, H. zea. There was an interaction between plant species and herbivore species: each plant species was most attractive when infested by its typical herbivore (e.g., H. virescens on tobacco). We compared these data with those of a previously published experiment on field parasitism of H. virescens and H. subflexa, conducted at the same time and place. Our results indicate that differences in parasitoid attraction to herbivore-induced plant volatiles do not contribute to H. subflexa's relatively low parasitism: rate. For the generalist, H. virescens, rates of attraction correspond with rates-of parasitism; for the. specialist, H. subflexa, they do not. Attraction to H: subflexa on P. angulata is greater than to H. virescens on P. angulata, yet parasitism of H. subflexa is much less than parasitism of H. virescens. These results. indicate that pre-detection defenses are not responsible for H. subflexa's low parasitism on P. angulata.

AB Although principal coordinates analysis is one of the most widely used ordination methods in ecology, no study had been undertaken as yet on the combined effect of gradient type and resemblance coefficient on the results. We examine the performance of principal coordinates analysis with different choices of the resemblance function and different types of a single, underlying gradient. Whereas unimodal species response to long gradients always leads to horseshoe (or arch)-shaped configurations in the first two dimensions, the converse is not true; curvilinear arrangements cannot generally be explained by the Gaussian model. Several resemblance coefficients widely used in ecology produce paradoxical arches from perfectly linear data. Species richness changes alone, may also lead to a horseshoe for even more distance functions, with the noted exception of Manhattan metric. The appearance of arches is a mathematical necessity in these cases; true artifacts are introduced only if distances are treated inappropriately before eigenanalysis. Examples illustrate that similar configurations (curves and even circles) may arise from very different data structures; therefore the shape of the point scatter is insufficient by itself to identify background ecological phenomena. The horseshoe effect may be diminished and eigenvalue extraction may be made more efficient if input measures are raised to high powers; but this operation is recommended only in combination with standard analyses, as part of a comparative approach. We derive a new distance function, implying standardization by species totals, from the chi-square distance. We found that this function improves gradient recovery when there is unimodal species response and. some species have their optima outside the range of study.

AB We used a large data set of African, Neotropical, and North American fishes to examine the frequency with which fishes have empty stomachs (n(species) = 254; n(individuals) = 36875). Mean percentage of empty stomachs was low across all fishes (16.2 +/- 1.2%) but varied from 0% to 79.4% among individual species. Nocturnal fishes had empty stomachs more frequently than diurnal fishes. Trophic classification was strongly associated with the percentage of empty stomachs, a pattern also revealed from an intraspecific analysis. Fishes appear to adjust their feeding intervals relative to the energy density, conversion efficiency, and particle size of their food. Piscivorous fishes seem to be the only trophic group that regularly experience long periods of empty stomachs, with species that consume prey whole and those that provide extended parental care having the highest proportions of empty stomachs. Activity patterns and life histories of some piscivorous species probably have evolved in partial response to energetic benefits of large, energy-rich food resources.

AB The response of an ecological system to perturbation can be described in terms of its resilience, essentially a measure of the time the system takes to return to its prior state. The resilience of an ecosystem is the result of interactions of the biota and their environment and will therefore change as the biota evolve and environmental conditions change. Ecological systems exist within the constraints of thermodynamic laws that prescribe the transfer of energy. Ecologically defined "thermodynamic imperatives," such as entropy, exergy, and ascendency, provide whole-ecosystem selection pressures that constrain the evolution of individuals within an ecosystem in addition to the selection pressures of individual evolution. The essence of these whole-ecosystem selection pressures may be captured by metrics. We have used a "genetic algorithm" to optimize these metrics, simulating the adaptation of a model ecosystem biota. Our simulations suggest the hypothesis that, within the constraints of the external environment and the genetic potential of their constituent biota, ecosystems will evolve to the state most resilient to perturbation.

AB Although the availability of food resources affects a wide range of ecological and evolutionary processes, its role in generating. patterns in natural systems remains largely unresolved. Elucidating the importance of resource availability should be made easier by the development of techniques that can measure the amount of resources that are accessible to a consumer, rather than simply the abundance of resources in the environment. In this study, I develop a behavioral assay for inferring the ratio of nutrients available to organisms in the field. The assay involves measuring the responses of foragers to nutrient solutions. These responses are used to determine the mean effective concentration, or ED50, of a nutrient, defined as the concentration that is rejected in 50% of trials. Because ED50 provides a measure of the quality of a depletable patch at which a consumer would quit foraging, it is analogous to the giving-up density (GUD), a common tool in ecological research. Here, I use ED(50)s to estimate the ratio of carbohydrates : protein available to ant colonies. Using supplementation experiments, I show that ED(50)s of sucrose and casein (a source of amino acids) reveal the net rates at which a colony expects to acquire each resource elsewhere in the environment. These results demonstrate that differences in ED(50)s will reveal differences in the availabilities of nutrients when other factors affecting the costs and benefits of foraging are controlled. To control these factors, I measured a colony's ED(50)s of sucrose and casein at the same time and location. Using this technique. I found that ratios of carbohydrate : protein availability differed significantly among 10 species of ants in southeastern Arizona, USA. Ratios were highest for species that are known to collect liquids from extrafloral nectaries and phloem-feeding insects. Carbohydrate : protein ratios may be especially low for three granivorous species, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, and Aphaenogaster cockerelli, which accepted sucrose solutions but rejected even highly concentrated casein Solutions. Because ratios of carbohydrate : protein availability differed substantially among species in the same habitat, the results of this study suggest that measures of resource abundance may poorly predict habitat quality for consumers.

AB The community matrix is potentially a powerful tool for community ecology. While it details direct interactions between community members, it can also be used to quantify all indirect effects that occur in a community, and thereby to make predictions regarding population response to experimental treatments or natural disturbances. These predictions are essentially hypotheses of system behavior that can be rigorously evaluated. Use of the community matrix, however, has been hindered by indeterminacy and ambiguity in response predictions. In this study, we reveal a theoretical source of the problem that arises as a consequence of community structure.
   Using a qualitative analysis of the community matrix, we detail the complementary feedback cycles that contribute to the response of a population following a sustained or press perturbation. Complementary feedback is the sum of all direct and indirect effects that can contribute to a response. We develop a "weighted-predictions matrix" that assigns a probability scale to sign determinacy of predicted responses. This matrix is formed by the quotient of the net sum of complementary feedback cycles and the absolute number of complementary feedback cycles.
   A qualitative analysis of system structure provides a theoretical benchmark for understanding a spectrum of behavior in biological systems, and for framing and prioritizing management interventions for whole communities. This advance clarifies much of the uncertainty and ambiguity found in predicting the behavior of large and complex systems. We validate these tools by analyzing published studies of community response.

AB The effects of neighbor vegetation during succession were studied in old-field and rain forest sites of central Amazonia. We investigated how plant litter and the availability of soil nutrients (P and K) influenced interactions between neighbor vegetation and colonizing species. We monitored the establishment and growth of seedlings of four tree species, sown in old-field and forest plots in which vegetation, plant litter, and soil P and K were experimentally manipulated. In the old field, removal of vegetation significantly decreased seedling establishment of Oenocarpus bataua, Socrathea exorrhiza, and Aspidosperma discolor (suggesting facilitation in these late successional species) but had no effect on Inga edulis (a mid successional species). In contrast, neighboring vegetation inhibited the growth of all sown species: removal significantly increased biomass. In the forest site, removal of forest vegetation had no effect on establishment but significantly increased seedling mass, suggesting inhibition. Plant litter removal significantly decreased seedling establishment of all species in the old-field, and of S. exorrhiza and I. edulis in the forest, suggesting positive effects. A significant interaction between plant litter and vegetation removal for O. bataua and S. exorrhiza in the old field showed that litter may also contribute to facilitation. Seedling mass of the three late-successional species was consistently not enhanced by P and K addition. In I. edulis, however, mass increased 2.5 times after P and K addition when vegetation was removed but did not vary in intact oldfield vegetation. Seedling establishment in the old field was significantly higher in S. exorrhiza and A. discolor compared to the forest, while plant biomass in S. exorrhiza, A. discolor, and I. edulis was significantly higher. Neither plant litter nor P and K addition could account for these differences. We conclude that facilitation and competition may operate during the early stages of forest succession in Amazonia, that plant litter contributes to the facilitation process, and that soil P and K do not influence the inhibition process, suggesting that light competition may be important. As succession proceeds, the effects of neighbor vegetation switch from positive to negative.

AB Resource allocation for reproduction of daphniids is strongly determined by the production of yolk protein. It is the main process channeling material into the reproductive pool of the animals. My investigations of yolk protein dynamics provided evidence that Daphnia are able to exhibit flexible brood reduction behavior and that individuals do not use all of the produced yolk protein for reproduction. The animals show parental optimism, meaning that they start to produce more material for offspring than they actually release. Yolk protein dynamics were influenced by predator-released kairomones. Fish kairomones influenced the beginning of yolk production resulting in a shorter time until first reproduction. In addition, daphniids exposed to fish kairomones used more of the produced yolk protein for reproduction than did control animals. The fish kairomone did not influence the rate of yolk production. In contrast, Chaoborus kairomones influenced the rate of yolk production, but did not change either the beginning of yolk production or the proportion of yolk that was used for egg production. The yolk protein dynamics of daphniids and their ability to exhibit flexible brood reduction behavior can help to explain kairomone-induced life history modifications of daphniids in numerous life history experiments.

AB Issues of spatial scale are inherent in many ecological systems. This study uses a spatially explicit cellular automaton model to explore how the scale of dispersal interacts with the scale and strength of negative frequency dependence to determine patterns of species distribution. Counter to expectation., strong local frequency-dependent interactions result in random spatial patterns. When dispersal scale and interaction scale are decoupled, the resulting patterns are not necessarily random. For strong negative frequency dependence, stable bands result when the scale of interaction exceeds the scale of dispersal, and bands with two-point cycles result when the scale of dispersal exceeds the scale of interaction. However, for weaker interactions occurring over intermediate scales, only random patterns result. Thus, our results call into question the utility of inferring any ecological interaction from only the spatial distributions of the putatively interacting species. Furthermore. our results call for new experimental studies that explicitly manipulate the strength and the scale of the processes being studied.

AB Lepidopteran larvae possess multiple defenses against a diverse group of predators and parasitoids. Many studies of larval defenses have determined whether a defense works against a particular enemy, but the question of which types of defenses are most effective against which types of enemy has not been examined closely. We assessed the efficacy of different caterpillar defenses against parasitoid wasps, flies, and nematodes,. and compared the results to earlier work with predatory invertebrates. Third to fifth instar caterpillars from 266 species and 30 families were collected in a lowland wet forest in Costa Rica during wet and dry seasons from 1996 through 1999, scored for various behavioral and morphological defenses, and then reared in the laboratory. Defense categories were used as predictor variables in logit models with parasitism as the response variable. Whether or not a particular caterpillar defense was effective depended on the taxon of parasitoid that attacked. Caterpillars attacked by flies benefited from a solitary, exophytic feeding habit; wasps were most deterred by biting, dropping, and regurgitating; and larvae attacked by nematodes benefited from both a solitary habit and, behavioral defenses. Mortality caused by parasitoids was high for caterpillars that are normally protected from predators. In particular, chemically defended herbivores that are undesirable meals for predators are safe hosts for parasitoids.

AB Rapid environmental changes have fostered debates and motivated research on how to effectively preserve or restore ecosystem processes. One such debate deals with the effects of biodiversity, and the loss thereof, on ecosystem processes. Recent studies demonstrate that resource-use complementarity, now known as the "niche-differentiation effect," and the presence of a competitive species with strong effects on ecosystem processes, now known as the "sampling effect," can explain why productivity and nutrient retention are sometimes enhanced with increasing species richness. In a well-replicated outdoor mesocosm experiment, we tested these and other alternative mechanisms that could explain the effects of submersed aquatic plant (macrophyte) diversity on wetland ecosystem processes. Algal biomass increased and phosphorus loss decreased as species richness increased. This result can best be explained by an indirect sampling effect caused by one of the weakest competitors, which appeared to facilitate algal growth and thereby filtering of particles, and thus phosphorus, from the water column. The dominant competitor also appeared to decrease phosphorus loss through direct effects on phosphorus availability in the soil and water. Thus, the effects by one of the weakest and the most dominant competitors combine to produce a diversity effect on phosphorus loss. Macrophyte biomass was not enhanced, but converged toward the intermediate biomass of the most competitive species. Such an "inverse sampling effect" may be produced when the most competitive species is not the most productive species owing to species-specific feedbacks and adaptations to the wetland environment. In summary, we reject the niche-differentiation effect as the dominant mechanism in our macrophyte communities and expand on the role of sampling effects in explaining the relationship between plant communities and ecosystem processes. In particular, indirect and inverse sampling effects combine to drive the relationship between species richness and wetland ecosystem processes. Thus, we demonstrate that plant diversity may affect wetland ecosystem processes when inferior competitors drive system productivity and nutrient retention. To ensure coexistence of such species with superior competitors, wetland systems may need to be maintained in a nonequilibrium state, such as with hydrologic disturbances, which would maintain both higher diversity and enhance ecosystem functioning.

AB Wintering Cape May Warblers (Dendroica tigrina) were studied in three habitats along an altitudinal gradient in the Dominican Republic. Results of this study are some of the first to link both population responses and individual condition of nonbreeding birds to prevailing ecological conditions across divergent habitats. Our data suggest that Cape May Warblers are habitat generalists and generally unspecialized resource opportunists, but that differences in food resources result in competitive interactions, sex and age class segregation, and differences in site fidelity and physiological condition among habitats. Diet of the Cape May Warbler varied between habitats: in desert, Cape Mays were primarily insectivores; in dry forest, they foraged primarily on homopteran honeydew; in pine forest, they were principally frugivores. Abundance of warblers as measured by mist-net captures was highest in pine forest sites. Males were more common than females in pine habitat, whereas there was a female-biased sex ratio in other sites. Adult birds were more common in the desert and the pine forest, but there was a bias toward immature birds in dry forest habitat. Overwinter site persistence was 76% in pine, but only 28% and 33% in dry forest and desert, respectively. Annual return rate averaged 57% and did not vary significantly among habitats. Adjusted body mass of site-persistent birds was highest in pine and dry forest and lowest in desert. Pectoral muscle mass scores increased in the pine forest throughout the sampling period, whereas muscle mass scores decreased in the desert. These data suggest that, among the habitats sampled, pine was preferred. It is likely that stability and predictability of resources. particularly fruiting Trema trees and nectar sources, attracted dominant Cape May Warblers to pine forests and kept them as site-persistent individuals in good body condition. In contrast, dry forest may have been suboptimal, unless an individual was able to hold and defend a tree with honeydew-producing homopteran scale insects. Desert thorn scrub was seemingly suboptimal because resources were consistently scarce, and conditions became increasingly difficult during the late-winter dry period.

   CONSEQUENCES
AB Populations in nature face a number of factors that can alter their traits and subsequent performance. Predation is one factor that can have widespread effects on the mean trait value in a prey population because predators can impact prey traits through a number of processes. Predators can directly induce prey phenotypes through visual and chemical cues, predators can indirectly alter prey phenotypes by thinning the prey population (thereby reducing competition), and predators can cause selection on prey phenotypes through nonrandom killing. Ecologists are beginning to understand each of these three processes in isolation, but these processes act on prey phenotypes simultaneously, and we lack information on the relative importance of these processes in determining the final phenotype of prey.
   I used a system of gray treefrog tadpoles (Hyla versicolor) and dragonfly predators (Anax longipes) to determine the separate and combined impacts of induction, thinning, and selection on the behavior, morphology, and growth of tadpoles reared in aquatic mesocosms. Using combinations of hand thinning, cues emitted from caged predators, and lethal predators, I demonstrated that the impact of lethal predators on growth was mediated primarily through thinning, the impact on morphology was primarily through induction, and the impact on behavior was affected similarly through thinning and induction. Surprisingly, while we know from numerous studies that the dragonflies kill tadpoles nonrandomly, selection did not have a significant impact on the final phenotypes of the tadpoles. This work appears to be the first study that identifies the relative magnitudes of the three predatory processes on a suite of prey phenotypes. The three processes can have opposing or supporting effects, the relative magnitudes of which likely differ among systems, illustrating why we often observe contradictory results when we examine the impact of lethal predators on prey phenotypes. Thus, it is important that we identify the mechanisms underlying the outcomes of predation, rather than simply observing the outcomes and then inferring which processes are responsible.

AB Effects of the toxicant cadmium were studied in blowfly populations, to test whether this abiotic factor could produce indirectly positive effects on demographic rates by interacting with density-dependent processes. A previous study has demonstrated that although cadmium is toxic to blowfly individuals, cadmium exposure of whole blowfly populations nevertheless results in increased mean pupal mass and biomass production. Moreover, statistical modeling of demographic rates has indicated that cadmium-exposed populations have higher larva-to-adult survival. The aim of the present study was to test this model prediction, and to describe underlying density-dependent mechanisms. Blowflies were exposed to cadmium in both low and high densities, in two subsequent generations. In the first generation (low densities) all demographic rates were reduced by cadmium exposure, whereas in the second generation (high densities), survival of old larvae and pupae was higher in cadmium-exposed populations than in control populations. The increased survival was due to reduced larval competition, which resulted from lower reproduction and lower survival of young larvae. Hence, the indirectly positive effects of the toxicant were caused by density-dependent compensatory reactions.

AB Evolutionary biologists have repeatedly argued that environmental factors have influenced the evolution of dioecy (males and females) from hermaphroditism in plants. While many researchers have focused on the role of pollinators and abiotic factors, far fewer have considered the enemy component of the environment. In this paper, I explore how herbivory may impact the evolution of dioecy from hermaphroditism through gynodioecy. This synthesis shows that the widespread occurrence of male-biased enemy attack in sexually dimorphic species is likely to have significant consequences for both the first and second steps in the evolution of dioecy through gynodioecy. I identify several ways that herbivory can influence sexual-system evolution, review the handful of studies that have explored them, and highlight exciting new avenues for research. From this review and synthesis, I conclude that consideration of enemies will provide a fresh dimension to our understanding of plant sexual systems.

AB Masting, the intermittent production of large flower or seed crops by a population of perennial plants, can enhance the reproductive success of participating plants and drive fluctuations in seed-consumer populations and other ecosystem components over large geographic areas. The spatial and taxonomic extent over which masting is synchronized can determine its success in enhancing individual plant fitness as well as its ecosystem-level effects, and it can indicate the types of proximal cue, that enable reproductive synchrony. Here, we demonstrate high intra- and intergeneric synchrony in mast seeding by 17 species of New Zealand plants from four families across > 150 000 km(2). The synchronous species vary ecologically (pollination and dispersal modes) and are geographically widely separated, so intergeneric synchrony seems unlikely to be adaptive per se. Synchronous fruiting by these species was associated with anomalously high temperatures the summer before seedfall, a cue linked with the La Nina phase of El Nino-Southern Oscillation. The lone asynchronous species appears,, to respond to summer temperatures, but with a 2-yr rather than 1-yr time lag. The importance of temperature anomalies as cues for synchronized masting suggests that the timing and intensity of masting may be sensitive to global climate change, with widespread effects on taxonomically disparate plant and animal communities.

ID ENVIRONMENT RELATIONSHIPS
AB Among the various forms of canonical analysis available in the statistical literature, RDA (redundancy analysis) and CCA (canonical correspondence analysis) have become instruments of choice for ecological research because they recognize different roles for the explanatory and response data tables. Data table Y contains the response variables (e.g., species data) while data table X contains the explanatory variables. RDA is an extension of multiple linear regression; it uses a linear model of relationship between the variables in X and Y. In CCA, the response variables are chi-square transformed as the initial step, but the relationship between the transformed response data and the explanatory variables in X is still assumed to be linear. There is no special reason why nature should linearly relate changes in species assemblages to changes in environmental variables, When modeling ecological processes, to assume linearity is unrealistic in most instances and is only done because more appropriate methods of analysis are not available. We propose two empirical methods of canonical analysis based on polynomial regression to do away with the assumption of linearity in modeling the relationships between the variables in X and Y. They are called polynomial RDA and polynomial CCA, respectively. and may be viewed as alternatives to classical linear RDA and CCA. Because the analysis uses nonlinear functions of the explanatory variables, new ways of representing these variables in biplot diagrams have been developed. The use of these methods is demonstrated on real data sets and using simulations. In the examples, the new techniques produced a noticeable increase in the amount of variation of Y accounted for by the model, compared to standard linear RDA and CCA. Freeware to carry out the new analyses is available in ESA's Electronic Data Archive, Ecological Archives.

AB Manipulative field experiments assessing the importance of interspecific competition on the dynamics of parasitoid populations and the impact of multiple parasitoids on host populations are virtually absent from the ecological literature. We report findings from such experiments assessing competitive interactions among three species of parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Aplielinidae) of the silverleaf whitefly Bemisia argentifolii Bellows & Perring (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae), a pestiferous species of worldwide importance. The parasitoids used in the study (Encarsia pergandiella Howard, Eretmocerus mundus Mercet, and Encarsia formosa Gahan) encompass the range of life histories found within Aphelinidae, and they exhibit a high degree of niche overlap. The objectives of our studies were ( I) to investigate the occurrence of interspecific competition among the whitefly parasitoids, (2) to quantify shifts in resource utilization patterns as influenced by experimental manipulations of the parasitoid assemblage and (3) to assess the impact of interspecific competition on the ability of the parasitoids to suppress their host populations.
   Field cages enclosing cotton plants were inoculated with whitefly by releasing adults at either a high or a low rate followed by releases of all possible combinations of the parasitoid species (including a no-parasitoid release control). The treatments were replicated three and four times each in 1996 and 1997. The presence of interspecific competitors reduced population growth rates of E. formosa and E. pergandiella but not the population growth rate of E. mundus. The spatial distribution of parasitism by E. pergandiella along the vertical axis of cotton plants differed in the multiple species treatments compared to the single species treatments. Changes in parasitoid activity in the presence of competitors may reduce potentially adverse effects of competition and promote species coexistence. Only releases of E. formosa together with E. pergandiella resulted in lower levels of host mortality than would be expected based on observed mortality by individual species. Our results demonstrate competitive interactions among three parasitoids of B. argentifolii under field manipulations but indicate that, in most cases, competitive interactions among parasitoids do not affect host population suppression.

AB We studied the effects of water column mixing depth and background turbidity on phytoplankton biomass, light climate, and nutrients in two field enclosure experiments designed to test, predictions of a dynamical model. In 1997 and 1998, we created gradients of mixing depth by enclosing the 100-mum-filtered phytoplankton community of a phosphorus-deficient lake in cylindrical plastic bags of varying depth (1.5-15 m) which were continuously mixed. To mimic different levels of background turbidity, we surrounded the transparent enclosure walls with a layer of opaque white (1997) or black (1998) plastic. The experiments were run for 4 wk (1997) and 6 wk (1998). The results supported two key assumptions of the model: specific production and specific sedimentation losses both decreased with increasing mixing depth. At all mixing depths, fast-sinking diatoms dominated (lie communities. In accordance with model predictions, algal biomass concentration and standing stock (summed over the mixed layer) showed a unimodal relationship to mixing depth when background turbidity was high (1998). When background turbidity was lower (1997), only the ascending limbs of the corresponding relationships were found, which support.,; the prediction that the mixing depth at which biomass peaks (i.e., becomes predominantly limited by light) increases with decreasing background turbidity. Also in accordance with predictions, light intensity at the bottom of the mixed layer decreased with increasing mixing depth and with increasing background turbidity. Finally, the data supported only the ascending limbs of the predicted inverse unimodal relationships among mixing depth and dissolved inorganic and total water column phosphorus. The absence of descending limbs in these relationships at low mixing depths was probably due to deviations of the experimental systems from two model assumptions. First, the remineralization rate of sedimented phosphorus may have been too slow to equilibrate with sedimentation losses over the experimental periods. Second, biomass yield per unit nutrient (the ratio of seston carbon to phosphorus) was not constant, but decreased with increasing mixing depth. To our knowledge, these are the first field experiments in which the effects of mixing depth on phytoplankton and its resources have been investigated systematically along a large gradient.

AB The study of spatial patterns in the distribution of organisms is a central issue in ecology. Here we address the question of whether predator-prey interactions can induce nonuniform distributions. We study how diffusion affects the stability of predator-prey coexistence equilibria and show a new difference between ratio- and prey-dependent models. Recently, Peter Abrams and Lev Ginzburg reviewed the controversial issue of what kind of function better describes the rate of prey consumption by an average predator. the so-called "predator functional response." Here, we focus on reaction-diffusion predator-prey models with and without predator dependence in the functional response. We show that classical prey-dependent models cannot give rise to spatial structures through diffusion-driven instabilities: however. predator-dependent models with the same degree of complexity can. The origin of predator dependence in the rate of prey consumption is the mutual interference between predators. Therefore, we show that this mechanism can generate patchiness in it homogeneous environment under certain conditions of trophic interaction and predator-prey relative diffusion.

AB We conducted a 3-yr field experiment that manipulated the presence of ungulates (domestic sheep and Spanish ibex Capra pyrenaica, Bovidae) and the monophagous beetle Timarcha lugens (Chrysomelidae) to evaluate (1) the effects on beetle abundance and interaction with the woody crucifer Hormathophylla spinosa (2) the reciprocal effect of this insect on the interaction between ungulates and the plant, (3) their impact on H. spinosa reproductive output; and (4) the abundance of an associated taxon. Ceutorhynchus sp. nov. (Curculionidae).
   Our experiment showed that ungulate exclusion increased Timarcha abundance. whereas Timarcha had no effect on ungulates. H. spinosa reproductive output increased threefold promptly when ungulates were excluded, although in the third year Timarcha be.-an to have effects on shrub reproduction. Ungulates affected weevils both by exploitative competition and by incidental predation, with the total number of weevils emerging per shrub being more than fourfold higher in shrubs excluded from these mammals than in shrubs open to them. In addition. during the last year. the abundance of weevils was also affected by Timarcha removal. Our study demonstrated that phytophagous insects can compete with other herbivores highly dissimilar in size, ecology, and taxonomy, such as ungulates. These interactions usually produce asymmetrical results. sometimes closer to amensalism or predation than to pure competition.

AB Species undergoing ontogenetic diet shifts face a risk of resource competition that delays transitions between feeding stages. Such ontogenetic bottlenecks are common in piscivorous fish because competition with future prey may retard growth and prevent a size advantage. In pikeperch (Stizostedion lucioperca), year class strength of 0+ cohorts is highly variable and positively related to early onset of piscivory. To identify the causes of this pattern, we experimentally quantified size-dependent planktivorous and piscivorous foraging capacity and incorporated the data into a growth model. For any given prey type and size, foraging capacity described a hump-shaped relationship with predator size. Foraging capacity on daphnids peaked at a pikeperch length of 66 mm, suggesting a narrow scope of planktivory. The highest capacity in the piscivorous niche was reached at a predator-to-prey length ratio of 5, where the ratio was an integrated measure of predator size over several prey sizes. With the growth model, we derived size distributions of 0+ cohorts as functions of resource levels. Simulations revealed two major determinants for the year class strength of pikeperch. First, discontinuous availability of prey sizes counteracted switching to piscivory within the first growing season. This was accentuated by prey fish growth, which caused the planktivory and piscivory niches to separate over time and limited the time window when diet shift was possible. Second, the hump-shaped relationship between size and foraging capacity resulted in growth reduction when growing out of the planktivorous niche. Switching to piscivory in our model occurred along a perpendicular relationship between fish prey and zooplankton density. Zooplankton density determined whether pikeperch reached a size advantage over prey, and fish prey density affected whether the foraging return of piscivory was higher than planktivory. Individuals not reaching a size advantage over prey and failing to become piscivorous were stunted at a size when consumption balanced metabolic requirements. Piscivorous individuals, however, continued to grow fast throughout the season by feeding on the wave of the prey cohort. Our results highlight the importance for predators that shift diet to be synchronized with fluctuations in resource availability, such as the pulses of new cohorts of prey fish.

AB Chronic nitrogen deposition may affect the long-term survival of plant Populations. The northern pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea, is a model system for forecasting extinction risk in the face of increasing nitrogen deposition. Uptake of N occurs directly from pitcher leaves, which fill with rainwater and prey, and accumulate nutrients. We monitored the demography of two populations of S. purpurea in ombrotrophic bogs of northern New England (USA) and described population growth with a four-stage matrix model. Growth, survivorship, and reproduction were in close balance, and the model predicted population growth rates close to zero, with long doubling times. In a life-table response experiment, we manipulated in situ concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in pitcher plant leaves. At high levels of N and high N:P ratios, population growth rates were significantly depressed. Using local N-deposition records, we forecast different N-deposition scenarios and built a nonstationary population growth model, in which a different transition matrix at each time step reflected the current deposition regime. Autocorrelation in the time series of N deposition rates generated periodic increases in population size superimposed on long-term trends of exponential decline. For a 1% annual increase in N deposition rates, this model predicted a substantial risk of extinction at 100 yr (0.38-0.70), with an estimated population survival time of 160-180 yr. Although slow-growing populations of Sarracenia can buffer substantial environmental change, chronic increases in N deposition rate threaten population persistence.

AB Recent reviews of plant-pollinator mutualistic networks showed that generalization is a common pattern in this type of interaction. Here we examine the ecological correlates of generalization patterns in plant-pollinator networks. especially how interaction patterns covary with latitude, elevation, and insularity. We review the few published analyses of whole networks and include unpublished material, analyzing 29 complete plant-pollinator networks that encompass arctic, alpine, temperate, Mediterranean, and subtropical-tropical areas. The number of interactions observed (1) was a linear function of network size (M) the maximum number of interactions: In I = 0.575 + 0.61 In M; R-2 = 0.946. The connectance (C), the fraction of observed interactions relative to the total possible. decreased exponentially with species richness, the SLIM of animal and plant species in each community (A + P): C = 13.83 exp[-0.003(A + P)]. After controlling for species richness, the residual connectance was significantly lower in highland (>1500 in elevation) than in lowland networks and differed marginally among biogeographic regions, with both alpine and tropical networks showing a trend for lower residual connectance. The two Mediterranean networks showed the highest residual connectance. After correcting for variation in network size, plant species were shown to be more generalized at higher latitude and lowland habitats, but showed increased specialization on islands. Oceanic island networks showed an impoverishment of potential animal pollinators (lower ratio of animal to plant species. A : P. compared to mainland networks) associated with this trend of increased specialization. Plants, but not their flower-visiting animals, supported the often-repeated statements about higher specificity in the tropics than at higher latitudes. The pattern of interaction buildup as diversity increases in pollination networks does not differ appreciably from other mutualisms, such as plant-seed disperser networks or more complex food webs.

AB The effect of evolutionary history on local-scale diversity patterns has often been suggested, but not shown. I explored whether widely described local-scale relationships between plant species richness and soil pH are related to evolutionary history. I expected positive relationships to occur between richness and pH if the pool of species that is suited for high pH soil is larger than the pool of species that is suited for low pH soil. In contrast, I expected negative relationships to occur between richness and pH if the pool of species that is suited for low pH soil is larger than the pool of species that is suited for high pH soil. I call this the species pool concept, because the direction of the relationship between richness and pH depends on whether the species pool has evolutionary origin on soils-of high or low pH. I used 85 published studies from all over the world and found that positive relationships between richness and pH were significantly more probable in floristic regions where evolutionary centers were on high pH soils, and negative relationships between richness and pH were more probable in regions where evolutionary centers were on low pH soils. Because soil pH increases with latitude, I also found that the relationship between richness and pH was positive at high latitudes and negative at low latitudes. Consequently, local relationships between plant diversity and soil pH are clearly related to evolutionary history.

AB Most ecological processes and interactions depend on scales much larger than a single habitat, and therefore it is important to link spatial patterns and ecological processes at a landscape scale. Here, we analyzed the effects of landscape context on the distribution of bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) at multiple spatial scales with respect to the following hypotheses: (1) Local abundance and diversity of bees increase with increasing proportion of the surrounding seminatural habitats. (2) Solitary wild bees, bumble bees, and honey bees respond to landscape context at different spatial scales, We selected 15 landscape sectors and determined the percentage of seminatural habitats and the diversity of habitat types at eight spatial scales (radius 250-3000 m) by field inspections and analyses of vegetation maps using two Geographic Information Systems. The percentage of seminatural habitats varied between 1.4% and 28%. In the center of each landscape sector a patch of potted flowering plants (four perennial and two annual species) was placed in the same habitat type, a grassy field margin adjacent to cereal fields. In all, 865 wild bee individuals and 467 honey bees were observed and an additional 475 individuals were caught for species identification, Species richness and abundance of solitary wild bees showed a close positive correlation with the percentage of seminatural habitats at small scales up to 750 in, whereas bumble bees and honey bees did not respond to landscape context at these scales. In contrast, honey bees were correlated with landscape context at large scales. The densities of flower-visiting honey bees even increased with decreasing proportion of seminatural habitats at a radius of 3000 m. We are not aware of any empirical studies showing contrasting foraging patterns related to landscape context at different spatial scales. We conclude (1) that local landscape destruction affects solitary wild bees more than social bees, possibly changing mutualistic plant-pollinator and competitive wild bees-honey bees interactions and (2) that only analyses of multiple spatial scales may detect the importance of the landscape context for local pollinator communities.

AB Freshwater ponds inhabited by larval amphibians can become encroached by forest vegetation. Surveys reveal that gradients formed by canopy cover can act as a selective sieve for the distribution of amphibian larvae among ponds. In eastern North America, many species, including spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer), are usually absent from ponds where forest canopies have closed over the pond basin. Relatively fewer species, including wood frogs (Rana sylvatica), are commonly present in both closed and open canopy ponds. Long-term observations reveal that canopy development is associated with extinction of spring peeper populations and persistence of wood frog populations. We evaluated performance of spring peeper and wood frog larvae in a set of experiments designed to assess three predictions: (1) that conditions in closed canopy ponds (e.g., lower temperature) are associated with depressed growth rates, (2) that the impact of canopy cover will be more severe on an open canopy specialist vs. a canopy generalist species, and (3) that abiotic differences between closed and open canopy ponds may provide a sufficient explanation for performance patterns. In support of the first prediction, a field transplant experiment showed that both species grew slower in closed vs. open canopy ponds. We found some support for the second prediction during two separate experiments. During the field experiment, the impact of canopy on spring peeper growth was similar to the effect on wood frogs. However, in a common garden experiment (in which physical conditions tended to coverge), spring peepers raised on substrates and water from closed canopy ponds grew substantially slower than conspecifics in the presence of water and substrate from open canopy ponds. By contrast, wood frogs grew faster in the closed canopy treatment. Finally, while recognizing that abiotic variation appears to play an important role in performance across the canopy gradient, we rejected the third hypothesis. We found that a biotic manipulation (food addition) partially mitigated depressed growth rates in closed canopy ponds. This result suggests that biotic factors (e.g., variation in abundance and composition of periphyton) also contribute to performance differences across the canopy gradient.

AB The harsh-benign model of community dynamics predicts that the impact of predation will decline as abiotic conditions become more stressful to biota. Experiments were conducted to determine whether hydrological disturbance altered the impact of an invertebrate predator in stream benthic communities. The impact of a predatory stonefly, Cosmioperla kuna, on its mayfly prey was measured in experimental stream channels receiving constant or variable flow (flooding) regimes over a one-week period. Contrary to predictions of the harsh-benign hypothesis, the impact of Cosmioperla oil its two major prey taxa was either unchanged or increased by artificial floods, despite increased predator emigration from variable-flow channels. Predator impacts in variable-flush treatments were apparently strongly influenced by predator-induced prey emigration during floods. The results of this study show that nonlethal predator effects may be important during abiotic disturbance, and that it may not be reasonable to predict the impact of predation solely on the basis of the relative tolerances of predators and prey to prevailing abiotic conditions.

AB We investigated factors that define boundaries between assemblages of streamside and terrestrial plethodonfid salamanders by manipulating the moisture gradient in the ecotone between headwater streams and upland forests in the Allegheny Mountains of Virginia. Two experiments tested the hypothesis that microhabitat distributions of species change in response to competitors whose distributions are controlled by variation across the landscape at a larger scale.
   In the first experiment we created replicated seeps (continuously moist patches) 3 m and 15 m from streams. Desmognathus fuscus, a streamside species, be.-an to increase in density at streamside seeps and to colonize distant seeps within 1.5 mo of their construction. Plethodon cinereus, a small terrestrial species, initially responded favorably to distant seeps but was displaced as seeps were colonized by streamside species. The D. fuscus colonists remained on distant plots with seeps 22 mo after water to seeps was turned off and the habitat had returned to pretreatment conditions. On streamside plots P. cinereus occurred at low densities initially and was quickly displaced by D. fuscus from portions of the plots near seeps. Gyrinophilus porphyriticus, a large streamside species, and Plethodon glutinosus, a large terrestrial species, were less abundant but exhibited responses that were similar to those of D. fuscus and P. cinereus, respectively.
   In the second experiment we created seeps in upland forests > 30 in from the nearest stream or natural seep, more than twice as far front a source of colonists as the distant seeps in the first experiment. The creation of seeps was crossed with the addition of logs and rocks as cover objects in a replicated factorial design. Plethodon cinereus became more abundant and had greater mass adjusted for body size on plots with seeps than on control plots. Abundance of P. cinereus also increased with the addition of cover objects. Plethodon glutinosus was on affected by the seeps. Streamside salamanders were rare or absent on all plots.
   These experiments demonstrate that the response of a species to an environmental perturbation can depend on the spatial context and presence of competitors or predators, and that the response may persist much longer than the perturbation itself.

AB Predation has been proposed as a major factor maintaining segregation among species of ungulates, but predator-prey interactions have not been observed to test this idea directly. Here, observations of coyote (Canis latrans) packs hunting deer are used to show that mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), which typically stand high on slopes and on rugged terrain, increased both their risk of being encountered and attacked by coyotes by standing low rather than high on slopes. The risk incurred at certain heights was not fixed: a mule deer's risk of being approached by coyotes was also affected by the height of other mule deer groups present during the same hunt. White-tailed deer (O. virginianus), which typically use gentle terrain, were not similarly disadvantaged by remaining low on slopes or on flat terrain. When confronted by coyotes, mule deer moved to and up slopes, whereas white-tails moved down and away from slopes. Species differences in behavior were independent of starting position and were observed for animals in mixed-species groups. Unlike their response to coyotes, feeding preferences or competition did not lead mule deer to use rugged habitats: mule deer moved down and left slopes to feed, bringing them closer to white-tails. These results suggest that coyote predation contributes to the habitat segregation of white-tails and mule deer (1) by selective predation against mule deer but not white-tails in gentle habitats and (2) by eliciting differing antipredator behavior that increases their segregation. Unlike prey involved in other examples of predator-mediated resource partitioning, white-tails and mule deer are similar in size and morphology. Contrasting antiprodator strategies, specifically, their ability to avoid predation using flight or confrontation, are likely to explain why the species differ in their behavior and in their risk on gentle terrain.

AB Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) analysis and randomized intervention analysis (RIA) are commonly applied to time series of response measurements obtained from two ecological units, one of which is subjected to an intervention at some intermediate time. Positive results from the analyses are interpreted as evidence of a potentially meaningful association between the intervention and the response. Applied to 154 pairs of actual ecological time series, RIA done at the 5% level rejected the hypothesis of no association 20% of the time when both units were in fact undisturbed, and 30% of the time when one of the two units had received an intervention. Correction for first-order serial autocorrelation in the time series of between-unit differences reduced these rejection frequencies to 15% and 28%, respectively. A two-stage analysis method that attempts to adjust for temporal variability of early and late response means failed to find an association in any of the pairs of "control" units, and found evidence of an association in only 14-15% of the pairs in which one unit was disturbed.
   These results suggest that RIA (and BACI analysis) greatly overstate the evidence for associations of interventions with ecological responses, and that attempts to modify these methods to account for temporal variability of response trajectories result in tests with very limited power. It may be that the best strategy for interpreting data from BACI designs is to rely on graphical presentation, expert judgment, and common sense, rather than P values derived from hypothesis tests of questionable validity.

AB During the Sonoran Desert Summer, saguaro cacti produce an abundant fruit crop whose nutrients and water have distinctive stable isotope compositions. Carbon stable isotope analyses indicated that, at the peak of saguaro fruit production, saguaro fruit represented >90% of White-winged Dove and similar to50% of Mourning Dove carbon incorporation. Over the entire summer, saguaro fruit comprised 50% and 14% of the diet of White-winged and Mourning Doves, respectively. In White-winged Doves, VC of their liver tissue and deltaD (deuterium) of their body water were linearly correlated, indicating that saguaro fruit was an important source of both nutrients and water. In Mourning Doves, in contrast, VC and deltaD were not correlated. Mourning Doves acquired nutrients but not water from saguaro fruit. Stable isotopes revealed that a common food plant sometimes provides a very different suite of resources to the different species that consume it.

AB Brood parasitism is not well documented in arthropods. We studied interactions among two species of salticid spiders (Habronattus tranquillus and Metaphidippus manni) and a diguetid spider (Diguetia mojavea). Observations and experiments show that these salticids invade a web and deposit their own eggs after D. mojavea mothers die. Although salticid eggs are laid after diguetid eggs are produced. their eggs are larger than those of diguetids, develop much more rapidly, and invariably emerge before the first diguetid spiderlings hatch. Salticid spiderlings also emerge at a significantly larger size than diguetid spiderlings. Thus. the salticid spiderlings have both timing and size advantages over the diguetid hatchlings. In addition. salticid spiderlings prey on resident diguetid juveniles and thereby significantly reduce the host's fitness. We document experimentally that one defense against this parasitism is the mother's presence after her egg sacs are deposited. Other possible diguetid defenses include high fecundity and asynchronous hatching of egg sacs. Our results suggest that these salticids are obligate brood parasites of D. mojavea and provide one of the first experimental examples of host-parasite coupling among arthropods.

AB Forest seedling demography and seedling diversity are commonly impacted by spatially variable microhabitat effects on germination and establishment. For many forests of the eastern United States. herbivory by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) also can be intense and impose severe restrictions on seedling demography. The concurrent effects of these "bottom-up" and "top-down" factors were examined in a riparian forest on the Patuxent Research Refuge, Maryland. USA.
   Random permanent-plot surveys found that two microhabitat factors. soil moisture and leaf litter, were correlated with seedling spatial distributions. These correlations suggest that microhabitat variability promotes seedling diversity. Microhabitat effects due to codominant American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) canopies had limited impacts on seedling demography but were consistent with the random surveys. In contrast, experimental results show that browsing had distinct demographic effects on seedling populations and strong collective impacts at the community level. Although not completely overriding the importance of microhabitat effects. browsing may be viewed as a consistent and spatially ubiquitous top-down constraint on seedling populations.
   Four distinctive relationships between seedling density and species-specific browsing intensity were apparent: density-independence, density-dependence, avoidance, and opportunism. These species-specific relationships are related to browsing preference, palatability, and life-history traits of the tree species. In contrast, at the community level browsing on woody species is strictly density dependent and emerges as a consequence of cumulative species-specific patterns. Because of complementary species-specific browsing patterns and variation among cohorts of each species, browsing impacts at the community level were more clearly defined. These impacts included a 39% increase in annual seedling mortality rate. a 42% reduction in seedling recruitment. a 28% reduction in basal-diameter increment. and a 35% reduction in the rate of population increase.
   White-tailed deer browsing in this forest has the potential to decrease seedling diversity by impacting species differentially, offsetting the diversifying impact of microhabital variation, and suppressing total seedling density. Nonetheless, browsing may not alter the trajectory of forest succession from that expected based on life-history characteristics of the two dominant species because: (1) American beech is shade tolerant and only slightly impacted by browsing, (2) codominant yellow-poplar is shade intolerant and a preferred browse species, and (3) the primary understory species (spicebush [Lindera benzoin] and ironwood [Carpinits caroliniana]), although heavily browsed. are not suppressed by browsing. Microhabitat. browsing, and tree species life-history traits should be considered collectively in considering the current status and predicted future of this forest.

AB The effect of temperature on the relationship between the Mediterranean marigold, Calendula arvensis (Asteraceae), and one of its most assiduous flower visitors in central Spain, the bombyliid fly Usia aurata, was studied for a five-year period. Calendula arvensis starts flowering when pollinators are still scarce. Mean temperature of the inflorescence surface was positively related to solar radiation and was 2degreesC higher than the surrounding air. Inflorescences proved to be heliotropic, traversing a 19degrees mean are from east,to west every day, and maintaining excess temperature during the period of maximum sunshine. Calendula arvensis showed high fruit production by self pollination. Neither fruit production nor fruit mass was limited by pollinators, but pollen germination was heavily limited by temperature. The optimum range for germination in the laboratory was 25-40degreesC. Under natural conditions, the temperature on C arvensis heads surpassed the minimum threshold for optimum pollen germination only during the period of maximum sunlight (midday).
   Usia aurata adults only, foraged on C arvensis heads, they only moved to feed, and they flew from head to head when sunshine was intense. In the laboratory, the temperature at which insects were able to fly ranged from 22degrees to 31degreesC for females, and between 21degrees and, 3 VC for males. No efficient physiological ability for thermoregulation was found either in females or in males, although females were able to warm themselves slightly. Nevertheless, heat captured passively on C. arvensis inflorescences was sufficient to reach the flying temperature range. Fly behavior on inflorescences also depended on their surface temperature: the higher is the temperature on heads, the longer the time spent feeding, and, the shorter the period spent basking.
   The role of solar warming of heads in plant reproductive fitness was related to stimulation of pollen germination rather than to pollinator attraction. The optimal temperature range for pollen germination overlapped with optimal temperature range for insect flying. U. aurata therefore acted as a pollinator of C. arvensis without playing a decisive role in plant reproductive fitness.

AB Increased exposure to ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation has been proposed as a major environmental stressor leading to global amphibian declines. Prior experimental evidence from the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW) indicating the acute embryonic sensitivity of at least four amphibian species to UV-B has been, central to the literature about amphibian decline. However, these results have not been expanded to address population-scale effects and natural landscape variation in UV-B transparency of water at amphibian breeding sites: both necessary links to assess the importance of UV-B for amphibian declines. We quantified the UV-B transparency of 136 potential amphibian breeding sites to establish the pattern of UV-B exposure across two montane regions in the PNW. Our data suggest that 85% of sites - are naturally proiected by dissolved organic matter in pond water, and that only a fraction of breeding sites are expected to experience UV-B intensities exceeding levels associated with elevated egg mortality. Thus, the spectral characteristics of natural waters likely mediate the physiological effects of UV-B on amphibian eggs in all but the clearest waters. These data imply that UV-B is unlikely to cause broad amphibian declines across the landscape of the American Northwest.

AB Estimation of population change from count surveys is complicated by variation in quality of information among sample units, by the need for covariates to accommodate factors that influence detectability of animals, and by multiple geographic scales of interest. We present a hierarchical model for estimation of population change from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Hierarchical models, in which population parameters at different geographic scales are viewed as random variables, provide a convenient framework for summary of population change among regions, accommodating regional variation in survey quality and a variety of distributional assumptions about observer effects and other nuisance parameters. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods provide a convenient means for fitting these models and also allow for construction of estimates of derived variables such as weighted regional trends and composite yearly population indices. We construct an overdispersed Poisson regression model for estimation of trend and year effects for Cerulean Warblers (Dendroica cerulea), accommodating nuisance covariates for observer and start-up effects, and estimating abundance- and area-weighted annual indices at regional and continent-wide geographic scales. A goodness-of-fit test is also presented for the model. Cerulean Warbers declined at a rate of 3.04% per year over the interval 1966-2000.

AB A venerable generalization about community resistance to invasions is that more diverse communities are more resistant to invasion. However, results of experimental and observational studies often conflict, leading to vigorous debate about the mechanistic importance of diversity in determining invasion success in the field, a well as other ecosystem properties, such as productivity and stability. In this study, we employed both field experiments and observational approaches to assess the effects of diversity on the invasion of a subtidal marine invertebrate community by three species of nonindigenous ascidians (sea squirts). In experimentally assembled communities, decreasing native diversity increased the survival and final percent cover of invaders, whereas the abundance of individual species had no effect on these measures of invasion success. Increasing native diversity also decreased the availability of open space, We limiting resource in this system, by buffering against fluctuations in the cover of individual species. This occurred because temporal patterns of abundance differed among species, so space was most consistently and completely occupied when more species were present. When we held diversity constant, but manipulated resource availability, we found that the settlement and recruitment of new invaders dramatically increased with increasing availability of open space. This suggests that the effect of diversity on invasion success is largely due to its effects on resource (space) availability. Apart from invasion resistance, the increased temporal stability found in more diverse communities may itself be considered an enhancement of ecosystem function.
   In field surveys, we found a strong negative correlation between native-species richness and the number and frequency of normative invaders at the scale of both a single quadrat (25 X 25 cm), and an entire site (50 X 50 in). Such a pattern suggests that the means by which diversity affects invasion resistance in our experiments is important in determining the distribution of invasive species in the field. Further synthesis of mechanistic and observational approaches should be encouraged, as this will increase our understanding of the conditions under which diversity does (and does not) play an important role in determining the distribution of invaders in the field.

AB Invasive ant species represent a serious threat to the integrity of many ecological communities, often causing decreases in the abundance and species richness of both native ants and other arthropods. One of the most in-depth and well-known Studies of this type documented a severe impact of the imported red fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, on the native ant and arthropod fauna of a biological field reserve in central Texas (USA) during the initial invasion in the late 1980s. I sampled the community again in 1999, 12 years later, utilizing the same methodology, to compare the short- and long-term impacts of this invasion. Pitfall traps and baits were used to obtain quantitative measures of the ant and arthropod community, and hand collecting was additionally employed to determine the overall ant species composition. Although the abundance and species richness of native ants and several other arthropod groups decreased precipitously immediately after the S. invicta invasion, all measures of native ant and arthropod species diversity had returned to preinvasion levels after 12 years. Solenopsis invicta was still the most abundant ant species, but not nearly as abundant as it was during the initial phase of the invasion. The results of this Study indicate that the impact of such invasive ants may be greatest during and shortly after the initial phase of an invasion.

AB Ecologists have long been interested in understanding the strengths of consumer and resource limitation in influencing communities. Here we ask three questions concerning the relative importance of nutrients and grazing fishes to primary producers of a tropical Andean stream: (1) Are stream algae nutrient limited? (2) Are top-down and bottom-up forces of dual importance in limiting primary producers? (3) Do grazing fishes modulate the degree of resource limitation?
   We obtained several lines of evidence suggesting that Andean stream algae are nitrogen limited. Addition of nitrogen in flow-through channels resulted in major increases in algal standing crop, whereas there were no measurable effects of phosphorus enrichment. Interestingly, the N-2-fixing cyanobacteria Anabaena was one of the taxa that responded most dramatically to the addition of nitrogen. Moreover, nutrient uptake rates were significantly higher for inorganic nitrogen (NO3-N and NH4-N) compared to phosphorus (PO4-P).
   Nutrients and the presence of grazing fishes were manipulated simultaneously in a series of experiments by using nutrient-diffusing substrates in fish exclusions vs. open cages accessible to the natural fish assemblage. We observed strong effects of both nitrogen addition and consumers on algal standing crop, although consumer limitation was found to be of considerably greater magnitude than resource limitation in influencing algal biomass and composition. Finally, the degree of resource limitation varied as a consequence of grazing fishes. Experiments examining nutrient limitation in the presence and absence of fishes showed that the response to nitrogen enrichment was significantly greater on substrates accessible to natural fish assemblages compared to substrates where grazing fishes were excluded. These experiments demonstrate simultaneous and interactive effects of top-down and bottom-up factors in limiting primary producers of tropical Andean streams. Whereas other studies have shown that consumers affect nutrient supply in ecosystems, our findings suggest that consumers can play an important role in influencing nutrient demand.

AB Although plant-plant facilitations have been shown to be important structuring forces in salt marshes, less attention has been given to the potential role played by plant-animal facilitations in structuring these communities. We used a combination of sampling and field experiments to evaluate the effect of microenvironmental changes produced by plant cover on the distribution of the burrowing crab Chasmagnathus granulata, a dominant macroinvertebrate of high marshes of the southwestern Atlantic coast. Four questions were explored. Is there a relationship between the spatial distribution of C. granulate and the spatial distribution of rooted macrophytes or distance from the marsh edge? How important is plant cover for the establishment and survival of crabs in the high marsh'? Does plant cover affect critical physical variables for crab establishment? How important are environmental conditions for the survival of crabs in the high marsh?
   Surveys of the marsh surface showed that: (1) there was a strong relationship between the presence of plant cover and the spatial distribution of Chasmagnathus granulata in the high marsh, and (2) both mean crab size and burrow density decreased from the marsh edge to high-marsh levels. By shading the substrate, live plants and experimental plant mimics were found to be equally efficient at buffering high temperature, dehydration, and soil hardness in the high marsh. Experimental amelioration of these harsh physical conditions led to higher crab densities. Crab burrows also buffered harsh environmental conditions, diminishing surface air temperature from similar to46degreesC to 23degreesC. Finally, tethering experiments showed that stressful heating in the high marsh is lethal for crabs, and that plant cover is crucial for the establishment and long-term success of crabs in the high marsh. No predation was observed in tethering experiments.
   Our results suggest that plant cover is largely responsible for determining the spatial distribution of this dominant crab in the high marsh through facilitation. Thus, our work shows that plant-animal facilitations as well as plant-plant facilitations are important structuring forces in salt marsh communities.

AB Widespread drought is among the most likely and devastating consequences of future global change. Assessment of drought impacts forecast by atmospheric models requires an understanding of natural drought variability, especially under conditions more arid than today. Using high-resolution lake-sediment records from the northern Great Plains, we show pronounced 100- to 130-yr drought cycles during the arid middle Holocene (8000 calendar yr BP). During drought phases, grass productivity declined, erosion and forbs increased, and fuel limitation reduced fire importance. Intervening humid decades saw grass production rise, with stabilization of soils and renewed fire as fuels became abundant. Although both C-3 and C-4 grasses declined during droughts, a lasting shift to C-3 dominance occurred during a single drought similar to8200 calendar yr BP During the more humid Late Holocene (2800 calendar yr BP), climate was less variable and without evident drought cyclicity. Consequently, drought severity during past, and possibly future, arid phases cannot be anticipated from the attenuated climate variability evident during contemporary humid phases. Our study demonstrates that agriculturally important grassland ecosystems respond sensitively to drought variability, uncertainty in which has profound implications for the future of these ecosystems.

AB I examined the consequences of local environmental variation on the seedling establishment of Prunus virginiana, common chokecherry. In western Montana, USA, this species produces large crops of small seeds in mesic riparian habitats and Small crops of large seeds in xeric slope habitats. From 1996 to 1999, I manipulated seed and seedling distributions. I altered seed size, density, distance from adult canopies, habitat, degree of protection from seedling predators, and the amount of soil moisture. In riparian habitats, seed dispersers tended to deposit seeds away from fruit tree canopies, and seedling establishment was greater away from canopies than under them. In both riparian and slope habitats, large seeds were more likely to be depredated than small seeds. However, seed and seedling depredation were more intense in riparian habitats. In slope habitat, seedling establishment was greatest under fruit tree canopies, where seed deposition by frugivores was most likely. In this habitat, large seeds produced seedlings with higher growth rates, and desiccation, rather than depredation, was the predominant cause of seedling mortality. In slope habitats, seedlings from small seeds experienced reduced survival when I did not provide supplemental water. On slopes, the importance of large seed size for seedling establishment may override the negative effects of size on dispersal likelihood. Because the canopy of slope plants may have overall positive effects on establishment, dispersal may be relatively unimportant or even undesirable. In contrast, in riparian habitats, the production of small, highly dispersible seeds may be critical because it reduces the negative effects of parental canopies.

AB We followed species richness, colonizations, extirpations, and turnover for eight years in 16 combinations of disturbance and nitrogen addition applied to a 30-yr-old Minnesota field. Four levels each of disturbance and nitrogen were applied in a completely factorial design, producing 16 treatments. There were four replicates of most treatments and 14 replicates of the four extreme treatments (lowest and highest disturbance and nitrogen). After 5-6 yr, species richness varied quadratically and significantly with disturbance in plots receiving no nitrogen or the lowest level of added nitrogen. Richness increased over time at intermediate disturbance as annuals colonized plots otherwise dominated by perennials. The number of growth forms also varied quadratically with richness, whereas the number of species belonging to each growth form did not, suggesting that high richness was due to coexistence of species with different life histories. The strongest quadratic variation in species richness was associated with significant quadratic variation in colonization with increasing disturbance, and no significant variation in extirpation, suggesting that increased richness at intermediate disturbance was attributable to colonization at the middle of the disturbance gradient, and not to extirpation at either end of the gradient. Richness decreased with increasing nitrogen at all levels of disturbance. Colonization also decreased and extirpation increased with increasing nitrogen availability, suggesting that decreases in richness with increasing nitrogen reflect accelerated extirpation, and not colonization of nitrogen-poor soils. Simultaneous competition experiments showed colonizations in disturbed plots to be related to reduced root competition, and extirpations in fertilized plots to be related to increased shoot competition. Surprisingly, untreated control plots had higher rates of colonization, extirpation, and species turnover than disturbed or fertilized plots. Turnover in control plots was caused mostly by uncommon species, and control plots were always dominated by the perennial grass Schizachyrium scoparium. In contrast, the dominant species of the extreme environmental treatments varied over time in spite of their low levels of richness. The array of responses generated by our factorial experiment helps explain why richness varies with disturbance and fertility in different ways along different natural gradients: patterns and dynamics of richness clearly depend on location within the fertility-disturbance matrix.

AB The spread of exotic species can be limited by dispersal or by constraints imposed by the local environment. Using data collected from 152 Missouri (USA) lakes over seven years, we asked whether models based on dispersal. or local-scale processes best predicted invasion by. the exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi. We used multiple logistic regression to test the relative importance of 10 local physicochemical features and proximity to all known potential source populations for predicting which lakes were invaded. The decline in invasion likelihood with distance to source populations was-used to estimate the shape of the dispersal kernel. Between 1992 and 1998 the cumulative prevalence of D. lumholtzi increased from 6% to 34% of lakes sampled, with frequent appearances of populations in new watersheds. Spatial position and physical factors were both important for predicting the new colonization events. The probability of colonization increased with lake surface area and epilimnetic temperature, declined with increasing conductivity, and was unaffected by variation in lake fertility. Invasion likelihood declined sharply as a nonlinear function of distance to source populations up to around 30 km, and was relatively constant at greater distances. The results suggest that dispersal and local abiotic constraints jointly limit the spread of D. lumholtzi. This approach illustrates how range expansion can be used to estimate dispersal rates at broad spatial scales.

AB Population matrix models,allow sets of demographic parameters to be summarized by a single value lambda, the finite rate of population increase. The consequences of change in individual demographic parameters are naturally measured by the corresponding changes in lambda; sensitivity analyses compare demographic parameters on the basis of these changes. These comparisons are complicated by issues of scale. Elasticity analysis, attempts to deal with issues of scale by comparing the effects of proportional changes in demographic parameters, but leads to inconsistencies in evaluating demographic rates. We discuss this and other problems of scaling in sensitivity analysis, and suggest a simple criterion for choosing appropriate scales. We apply our suggestions to data for the killer whale, Orcinus orca.

AB Spatial synchrony, that is, correlated population fluctuation over wide geographical areas, has been detected in diverse taxa and over various geographical scales. The most commonly suggested mechanisms to explain Spatial synchrony include dispersal, and regional stochasticity (i.e., "the Moran effect"). We analyzed landscape-scale historical outbreak data for six forest insect species: spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), western spruce budworm (C. occidentalis), larch bud moth (Zeiraphera diniana), forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), and gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). We used a recently developed statistical method (the nonparametric covariance function) for quantifying the magnitude and spatial range of synchrony in both outbreak and corresponding weather data. The varying dispersal capabilities of the species enabled us to speculate on the relative importance of dispersal vs. the Moran effect as potential mechanisms behind the observed patterns. Our results indicated that spatial synchrony was not directly associated with dispersal capabilities at the spatial scales considered. In contrast, the spatial correlation in weather variables was high enough to account for the levels of synchrony observed in the outbreak data. Therefore, the Moran effect appeared to be the more dominant process affecting the spatial dynamics of these species at the landscape scale. In general, however, the synchrony in outbreaks declined more steeply with geographical distance than the correlation in the weather variables, breaking with the predictions of Moran's theorem. A more detailed analysis of gypsy moth outbreak data showed that local dynamics varied considerably in a spatially dependent manner. The existence of such variation violates one of the assumptions of the Moran's theorem, namely, that the dynamic properties of disjunct populations are identical. We used a simple theoretical model to demonstrate that such geographical variation in local population dynamics may indeed force synchrony to decline more rapidly with distance than the correlation in the environment.

AB Understanding the maintenance of high tropical tree species diversity requires disentangling the effects of habitat vs. geographic distance. Using floristic, topographic, and soil nutrient data from 105 0.6-ha plots in mixed dipterocarp forest throughout Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, we explore the degree to which floristic patterns are habitat-driven from local to landscape scales. We assess how the floristic influence of geographic distance vs. abiotic factors varies from local to regional scales. We employ several multivariate analytical techniques and perform a hierarchical clustering of the research plots using the Steinhaus index of floristic dissimilarity, as well as Mantel analyses on matrices of floristic, habitat, and geographic distance. These analyses indicate that floristic variation is more strongly correlated with habitat than with geographic distance on the regional scale. On the local-landscape to community scale, we find evidence of a resource threshold above which habitat effects weaken; that is, below the resource threshold floristic similarity between sites is dominated by habitat effects, while above the threshold floristic similarity between sites is dominated by geographic-distance effects. We also find evidence that topography and soil nutrients correlate in part independently with floristics. These results, together with previous studies in the Neotropics, emphasize that tree species distribution and community composition are variously influenced by the interplay of both habitat and dispersal-driven effects.

AB We provide an exemplar study for investigating the manner and extent to which plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) influence nutritional regulation in herbivores selecting among multiple foods. Two experiments were performed using the African migratory locust, Locusta migratoria (L:). In both cases, locusts were given access to multiple synthetic foods that varied in their concentration of the two most strongly regulated nutrients (protein and digestible carbohydrate) and a carbon-based PSM, tannic acid (TA). Insects in the first experiment were given two suboptimal but complementary foods: a high-protein, low-carbohydrate food and a low-protein, high-carbohydrate food. Tannic acid was then added to one food type but not the other, to both, or to neither food type. Here we could see how the addition of TA to a food with a specific protein: carbohydrate profile influenced nutritional regulatory responses. In a second experiment, locusts were given a high-protein, low-carbohydrate food and a low-protein, high-carbohydrate food, both of which contained TA. A third TA-free food containing one of five different protein: carbohydrate ratios was also provided. This experiment provided an opportunity to measure the extent to which a TA-free resource would be incorporated into the diet in relation to its nutrient content. Results indicated that the extent to which locusts regulated their protein carbohydrate intake depended on the protein: carbohydrate composition of the TA-free foods in their environments. It was evident that TA is more effective as a feeding deterrent than as a post-ingestive toxin, but its effectiveness as a feeding deterrent is strongly linked to the protein: carbohydrate composition of the food in which it occurs. We discuss these findings within the context of plant defense theory and models of foraging behavior.

AB Why do parent birds hatch their young asynchronously? This phenotypic handicap exacts a cost of reduced growth and elevated mortality from the last-hatched or "marginal" offspring, while conferring advantages to the more senior "core" brood. David Lack long ago proposed that marginal offspring allow parents to track resources that are uncertain at the time of clutch initiation. If food is insufficient for the entire brood, hatching asynchrony allows surplus marginal offspring to be culled from the brood efficiently. This in effect represents a secondary adjustment of clutch size. Today Lack's hypothesis remains a central, although controversial, component, of discussions of hatching asynchrony and avian brood reduction. Most field workers report results inconsistent with Lack's hypothesis (e.g., a failure of asynchronously hatching broods to produce more fledglings than do experimentally synchronized broods) and have offered a variety of alternative explanations. Previous workers have focused, with limited success, on single explanations for the complex phenomena of hatching asynchrony. Here we use parental optimism theory to study the secondary adjustment of clutch size in an integrated framework emphasizing ecological (tracking uncertain resources) and developmental (unpredictable survival, quality and/or sex of progeny) uncertainty. We present the results of a 6-yr study of Yellow-headed Blackbirds (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus), a marsh-nesting icterid. Marginal offspring that are the products of hatching asynchrony serve multiple functions simultaneously: in tracking resources that vary temporally; as a hedge against hatching failure; and in progeny choice via sex-biased brood reduction. The effect of the phenotypic handicap was diminished both by improving ecological conditions and by hatching failure/experimental clutch reduction. Marginal offspring represent high variance progeny, and synchrony represents a high variance strategy. Brood reduction occurred at low cost and was rendered more efficient by hatching asynchrony, particularly under conditions of stringency.

AB In size-structured predator-prey systems, capture success depends on the sizes of both predator and prey. We study the population-dynamic consequences of size-dependent predation using a model of a size-structured, cannibalistic fish population with one shared, alternative resource. We assume that a prey can be captured by a predator if the ratio of prey length to predator length is within a specific range, referred to as the "predation window." We find that the lower limit of the predation window (delta) has a major impact on population dynamics, whereas the upper limit (epsilon) mainly affects population structure and individual life history. For large delta, cannibalism cannot decimate young-of-year (YOY) cohorts. Size-dependent competition then results in recruit-driven, single-cohort cycles. With low delta, cannibalism regulates recruitment, resulting in coexistence of many year classes. With intermediate delta, periods of regulation by cannibalism alternate with periods with severe competition. Occasional high densities of small individuals enable a few cannibals to reach giant sizes, producing a bimodal population size distribution. With small s, all individuals remain small; the population is stunted. Large piscivores can exist only if induced dynamically in population fluctuations. Above a critical s, large piscivores are present permanently, even in stable populations. The critical effect of delta relates to the ontogenetic niche shift from planktivory to piscivory. Observed population dynamics of Eurasian perch, yellow perch, and Arctic char, described in the literature, are discussed and, based on our modeling results, can be related to differences in the predation windows of these species. We argue that the effects of delta and s relate to two fundamentally different and mutually exclusive aspects of cannibalism.

AB Ecology, although a rapidly evolving science, has experienced few if any paradigm shifts or revolutions in the sense of Thomas Kuhn because it is a pluralistic, multiple-causation discipline. Instead, what appears to characterize conceptual development are fads or "bandwagons," favored themes, or transient foci of interest, that wax, wane, and even recover in popularity. These are often centered on characteristics of the real world which cannot be denied. I identify and discuss two: postlarval recruitment to an established population and physical disturbance to an intertidal assemblage. The richness of ecological thought has been broadened immeasurably by acceptance of the following themes: the necessity to distinguish open from closed systems, that equilibrium may exist only in an abstract sense, and that controlled manipulation can reveal hitherto unanticipated dynamics. These findings have expanded our understanding of nature's complexity (a conceptual evolution) rather than relegated most prior generalizations to the dustbin of history (a paradigm shift).

AB Parasites are ubiquitous, but widely neglected, components of food webs. Because of their trophic position, parasites may have major direct and indirect effects on community structure. Because the magnitude of these effects is likely to depend on parasite density, this study was undertaken to explore temporal patterns in the density of parasites and the processes responsible for those patterns. Parasitism by Howardula nematodes was monitored in four species of mycophagous Drosophila (D. falleni, D. neotestacea, D. putrida, and D. recens) that were sampled monthly from 1984 through 1998 near Rochester, New York, USA. Adult flies were collected by sweep netting over naturally occurring mushrooms or commercial Agaricus bisportis mushrooms that had been set out as baits. These adults were then dissected to determine whether they were parasitized by Howardula nematodes.
   The prevalence of parasitism varied substantially among species, being greatest in D. neotestacea (23.0% infected) and least in D. recens (4.8%). Parasitism was greatest in the spring and fall, and least in midsummer. Prevalence of parasitism covaried significantly through time among the three principal host species, D. falleni, D. neotestacea, and D. putrida, in part because the different species often breed in the same individual mushrooms, the site where nematode transmission from adult flies to larvae occurs. The mean prevalence of parasitism across these three species at the end of the season (September) was significantly correlated with the total precipitation from May through August. The mean prevalence of parasitism in the spring collections was significantly correlated with the mean prevalence the previous fall, because flies overwinter as adults. Consequently, the mean prevalence of parasitism in spring was highly correlated with May through August precipitation the previous year. It is hypothesized that rainfall, which stimulates the production of mushrooms (the flies' breeding sites), interacts with density-dependent nematode transmission to influence the prevalence of parasitism in these populations.

AB Many trees in mature forests show intermittent reproduction. Intensive flowering and seed production occur only once in several years, often synchronized over a long distance. In a previous paper, we showed that the limitation of fruit production by the outcross pollen availability can bring about synchronized reproduction of trees in a constant environment, assuming that pollen availability depends on the mean flowering intensity of the trees. However, pollen exchange normally occurs within a distance much shorter than the extent of the whole forest. We studied a coupled map lattice, in which each tree engages in the chaotic dynamics of energy reserve level, but different trees are coupled by pollen exchange with neighbors. We first derived a relation between two statistics of spatial covariance (dynamic spatial covariance and snapshot spatial covariance). A strong synchronization of tree reproduction can develop over the whole forest that may be orders of magnitude larger than the distance of direct pollen exchange between trees. The fluctuation is close to a cycle with a period of two years. The model of local coupling always generates non-uniform spatial patterns, but the enhanced spatial covariance caused by the spatial heterogeneity is restricted to a short range, only a few times larger than the spatial range of direct interaction. When pollen exchange occurs beyond the nearest neighbors, the local spatial pattern becomes proportionally larger, but the condition for synchronization of the whole forest and its magnitude are the same as for the case with the nearest neighbor pollen exchange. When a fraction of the seeds are sired by globally dispersed pollen and the rest are sired by local pollen, long-range synchronization can occur for a wide-parameter region, and trees may engage in a fluctuation with a masting interval longer than two years. We discuss alternative explanations for the long-range synchronization of beech forests.

AB Many kinds of adaptive behavior, including responses to risk of predation, have been documented, but there have been few attempts to translate these behaviors into consequences for populations. We present one of the first models to predict the consequences of adaptive behavior for population size in a specific natural system. Larvae of the mosquito Culiseta longiareolata (Diptera: Culicidae) develop in freshwater pools. They are vulnerable to predation by the backswimmer Notonecta maculata (Hemiptera: Heteroptera), and to intraspecific competition. Adult female C. longiareolata usually avoid ovipositing in pools that contain N. maculata. This is presumably an adaptive response that increases individual fitness, but it is also likely to affect the size of the population. We take a novel approach to understanding the relationship between adaptive behavior and population dynamics in C. longiareolata. We use a nonlinear stage-structured population model to predict the evolutionarily stable oviposition strategy and its consequences for the size of the C. longiareolata population. Our model predicts that female C. longiareolata should always avoid ovipositing in pools with N. maculata. Such avoidance will increase the equilibrium size of the C. longiareolata population, relative to a population in which oviposition is indiscriminate with respect to N. maculata. The qualitative effect on population size is the same even if, as observed, C. longiareolata occasionally oviposit in pools containing N. maculata. These predictions have important practical implications for assessing the effectiveness of predators as biological control agents.

AB The ubiquity of the latitudinal gradient of species richness is well documented at coarse scales of resolution, but the extent to which the pattern is recapitulated at the level of local communities for any aspect of biodiversity (i.e., richness, evenness, or diversity) is unclear, We examined how attributes of New World bat diversity vary with each other and with latitude at two scales of resolution: local communities and regional species pools. We calculated 14 indices of diversity (species richness [three], evenness [four], dominance [three], and diversity [four]) from species abundance distributions for 32 intensively sampled local sites between 42.25degrees N and 24.12degrees S latitude. The species richness of each corresponding regional pool was estimated from published range maps. In general, the gradient of local species richness was less steep than the corresponding gradient of regional species richness; beta diversity in the tropics is greater than that for temperate communities. All aspects of diversity at the local scale did not vary with latitude in the same manner. The latitudinal gradient in species diversity of local communities was primarily a consequence of the corresponding gradient in species richness. Local richness increased and became more variable with decreasing latitude. In contrast, species evenness did not vary in a systematic fashion with latitude. Although the absolute number of rare species in communities increased faster with latitude than did that of common species, both abundance classes proportionately increased with latitude in equivalent ways throughout the New World. In general, latitudinal variation at the community level was detected in diversity indices that were insensitive to the abundance of species. The dramatic increase in species richness at broad scales of resolution toward the tropics (gamma diversity) was as much a consequence of increased richness at the local level (alpha diversity) as it was a consequence of the latitudinal increase in species turnover among communities (beta diversity). Future theoretical research should examine the correlates of latitude that enhance differentiation among communities at low latitudes (i.e., those which enjoy high productivities). Conservation strategies based on assessments of diversity at coarse levels of resolution (gamma diversity) should be implemented with caution because beta diversity inflates regional estimates of diversity.

AB Slavemaking ants are of great interest to biologists because of their highly specialized lifestyle. Slavemakers rely on the presence of heterospecific "slaves" to perform routine chores such as foraging and brood care. While we have considerable information on the behavior of these ants, mostly gleaned from laboratory studies, we know very little of their basic ecology. Here we report data collected over 20 yr in three geographic sites on the occurrence. spatial pattern. nest site use, and demography of two slavemaker species and three of the host species they enslave, all are small ants in the tribe Formicoxenini. We found geographic and temporal variation with respect to the interaction between social parasites and their hosts. The slavemaker Protomognathus americanus occurred in each geographic site, and in each its most common host was Leptothorax longispinosus; the other known hosts of this slavemaker, L. curvispinosus and L. ambiguus were less abundant. In a West Virginia site. slavemaker nests were smaller than in New York and Vermont sites. Additional data from West Virginia showed that the slavemaker is strongly constrained by its hosts there. but we found little impact of the parasite on its hosts. By contrast, in the New York site, we found strong evidence that the majority host was affected by the slavemaker: host nests showed important life history shifts between neighborhoods containing slavemakers vs. those that were parasite-free. Furthermore. the slavemaker was able to Subjugate large host nests there and had large slave pools. In a third site in Vermont. parasite and host demography reflected their interaction weakly. We discovered a second slavemaking species there. and both parasites were preferentially found in areas of high host density. However, we uncovered no demographic or spatial evidence that slavemakers affected their hosts in Vermont. Likewise, we found no evidence in any site of demographic responses by the minority hosts to the presence of slavemakers. Thus our results imply that host-parasite interactions varied among host species and among geographic locales. The slavemaker system therefore is amenable to analysis in terms of parasite-host coevolution.

AB Nitrogen availability may be a major factor structuring ectomycorrhizal fungal communities. Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has been implicated in the decline of ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) sporocarp diversity. We previously characterized the pattern of decreased sporocarp species richness over an anthropogenic N deposition gradient in Alaska (USA). To determine whether this change in sporocarp community structure was paralleled below ground. we used molecular and morphological techniques to characterize the ectomycorrhizal community of white spruce (Picea glauca) over this gradient. We then related patterns of richness and relative abundance of taxa to various N-affected environmental parameters. Species richness of EMF declined dramatically with increasing N inputs. Over 30 taxa were identified at the low-N sites. compared with nine at the high-N sites. Low-N site dominants (Piloderma spp., Amphinema byssoides, Cortinarius spp., and various dark-mantled Tomentella spp.) disappeared completely at the high-N sites, where they were replaced by Lactarius theiogalus, Paxillus involutus, Tylospora fibrillosa, Tomentella sublilacina, Thelephora terrestris. and an unidentified species. Lactarius theiogalus accounted for 44-68% of the root tips at the high-N sites, compared with 7-20% of tips at the low-N sites. Organic horizon mineral N and foliar nutrient ratios (N:P, P:AI) were excellent predictors of taxonomic richness (r(2) > 0.93). Organic horizon NO3- availability was the best predictor of abundance of many taxa. These patterns suggest that long-term N deposition can lead to decline in EMF species richness, and dramatic changes in EMF community structure, The consequences of these changes for plant nutrition and ecosystem function depend on how EMF community function changes as community structure changes. We speculate that as N inputs increase, the EMF community shifts front taxa specialized for N uptake under low-N conditions (e.g., Cortinarius, Piloderma), toward taxa specialized for high overall nutrient availability (e.g.. Tomentella sublilacina, Thelephora terrestris) and finally toward taxa specialized for P uptake under high-N. low-P, acidified conditions (e.g.. Paxillus involutus, Lactarius theiogalus).

AB The nature of resource limitation for zooplankton grazers is strongly debated. We provide a test of stoichiometric constraints and three alternative mechanisms of resource limitation in six lakes that represent a natural gradient in resource quality. Growth assays measured the responses of juvenile Daphnia to concentrated natural resources and to supplements of phosphate (P), essential fatty acids (EFA), and P-deficient and P-rich algae. Assimilation experiments quantified the digestibility of P-32-labeled resources. Daphnia growth was much lower on resources from deep compared with shallow lakes (0.13 +/- 0.01 d(-1) and 0.30 +/- 0.03 d(-1), respectively) but was independent of resource concentration. Growth was negatively correlated with the resource C:P ratio, but the relationship was not causal as responses to the P supplement were very weak. Adding EFA also produced weak responses. In contrast, supplements of readily digested algae stimulated moderate (P-deficient) and strong (P-rich) increases in growth that accounted for growth variation among the lakes. Changes in Daphnia P balance Were also contrary to P limitation. In all, our growth assays implicate energy limitation unrelated to food concentration and, therefore, support the digestion resistance hypothesis. Digestion resistance is further supported by a positive correlation between assimilation efficiency and growth. Our results show that stoichiometric theory needs to be integrated with theory on plant and algal defenses against herbivores.

AB Specialized enemies, such as predators and parasitoids, play an important role in the population cycles of small animals by generating delayed density dependence. We investigated the role of predation in population cycles in an undisturbed large-mammal system using long-term data on the sustained density fluctuations of wolves and moose on Isle Royale (Michigan, USA). Nonlinear time-series analysis revealed that wolves display phase-dependent dynamics with stronger density dependence during the decline phase than during the increase phase. This phase dependence was also reflected in predation rates: the number of moose killed daily by wolves was greater during the wolf increase phase than during the wolf decline phase. Accordingly, moose displayed multi-annual cycles generated by an interaction between weak self-regulation and strong delayed density dependence during periods of wolf increase, and strong self-regulation with negligible delayed density dependence during periods of wolf decline. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first formal documentation of population cycles in large mammals. By making use of long-term data at both trophic levels, as well as data on predator behavior, this analysis may, shed light on the mechanisms through which predators contribute to population cycles of prey in other taxa.

AB Global climate change may affect the upper elevational limits of distribution of montane organisms, especially if those limits are set directly by temperature. Oviparous (egg-laying) reptiles are constrained in this way because of their nesting requirements. In many areas, deforestation has already subjected these animals to small-scale "climate change." Clearing for power lines (hydrocuts) increases solar radiation to potential nest sites, and hence enables these animals to penetrate higher into montane areas than would otherwise be possible. Such small-scale anthropogenic "warming" may offer a useful model system to explore consequences of broader climate change on the distribution and biology of montane organisms. We quantified thermal effects of a hydrocut in montane eucalypt forest in the Brindabella Range of southeastern Australia. The reduced canopy cover, increased duration of sunlight exposure, and higher levels of incident radiation in cleared areas substantially modified thermal regimes in potential nest sites. Orientation and exposure were the most important determinants of nest temperature and predicted the distribution of natural nests. Such cleared corridors (for roads, power lines, ski runs, etc.) may not only extend the upper elevational limit for oviparous reptiles, but may also modify the genetic structure and demography of populations.

AB Past studies of foraging-patch exploitation among granivorous animals largely have focused on mammals, so we sought to test patch-use strategies in an avian granivore, the Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura). Based on available experimental evidence and existing food habits/selection information, we hypothesized that Mourning Doves use a fixed-time patch departure strategy and an expanding specialist within-patch diet-selection strategy (specialization at high resource densities but generalization at low densities). We tested predictions based on these hypotheses and selected alternatives in three outdoor aviary experiments. Mourning Doves failed to equalize food giving-up densities (GUDs; food densities at the point of patch departure) between rich and poor patches, and no indirect interactions took place between multiple foods in patches. The ratio of GUDs between rich and poor patches equaled the ratio of initial food densities. Neither selectivity among, nor ratio of GUDs between, multiple foods varied with degree of patch exploitation. Results of all experiments supported a fixed-time patch-departure strategy among Mourning Doves; this may be a general pattern among open area-foraging avian granivores.. A fixed-time strategy in this guild may indicate inability to assess patch resource density, possibly due to lack of olfactory capabilities or to a constant rate of seed intake,at most seed densities. Results did not completely support an expanding specialist diet-selection strategy, but this strategy seems a more likely cause of partial diet preferences than does an alternative mechanism, a generalist strategy with unequal encounter rates.

AB Factors such as aggressiveness and adaptation to disturbed environments have,been suggested as important characteristics of invasive ant species, but diet has rarely been considered. However, because invasive ants reach extraordinary densities at introduced locations, increased feeding efficiency or increased exploitation of new foods should be important in their success.
   Earlier studies suggest that honeydew produced by Homoptera (e.g., aphids, mealybugs, scale insects) may be important in the diet of the invasive ant species Solenopsis invicta. To determine if this is the case, we studied associations of S. invicta and Homoptera in east Texas and conducted a regional survey for such associations throughout the species' range in the southeast United States. In east Texas, we found that S. invicta tended Homoptera extensively and actively constructed shelters around them. The shelters housed a variety of Homoptera whose frequency differed according to either site location or season, presumably because of differences in host plant availability and temperature. Overall, we estimate that the honeydew produced in Homoptera shelters at study sites in east Texas could supply nearly one-half of the daily energetic requirements of an S. invicta colony. Of that, 70% may come from a single species of invasive Homoptera, the mealybug Antonina graminis. Homoptera shelters were also common at regional survey sites and A. graminis occurred in shelters at nine of 11 survey sites. A comparison of shelter densities at survey sites and in east Texas suggests that our results from east Texas could apply throughout the range of S. invicta in the southeast United States. Antonina graminis may be an exceptionally important nutritional resource for S. invicta in the southeast United States. While it remains largely unstudied, the tending of introduced or invasive Homoptera also appears important to other, and perhaps all, invasive ant species. Exploitative or mutually beneficial associations that occur between these insects may be an important, previously unrecognized factor promoting their success.

AB Many foliar endophytic fungi deter herbivores from feeding on their host plants, but a previous study has suggested that their deterrent effect may be reduced in the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizae. In our study, factorial experiments determined the effects of infection of perennial ryegrass, Lolitim perenne, by the foliar endophyte Neotyphodium lolii [present (+E) or absent (-E)] and the mycorrhizal fungus Gloinits mosseae [present (+M) or absent (-M)] on larvae of the noctuid moth Phlogophora meticulosa.
   When host plants received adequate phosphorus (P), mycorrhizae and the foliar endophyte decreased the survivorship of larvae between their second and fifth instar in an additive manner. Sixth-instar larvae feeding on -M-E plants attained greater mass than those feeding on plants with one or both symbionts. There was an M X E interaction with the total amount of grass consumed per larva. The foliar endophyte increased relative consumption rate and reduced efficiency of conversion of ingested food of larvae. while the mycorrhizal fungus had no effect on insect nutritional indices.
   Larvae preferred -E over +E leaf blades regardless of mycorrhizal infection status. They showed no preference with respect to plant mycorrhizal status. When foraging among mixed stands of intact plants, larvae inflicted more damage oil -E than on +E plants. Mycorrhizae reduced feeding damage, but only in -E plants and to a lesser extent than the foliar endophyte. The relative difference between +E and -E plants, in terms of grazing damage, was decreased but not eliminated by mycorrhizae.
   When P was limiting to plant growth, mycorrhizae still decreased the survivorship of larvae between their second and fifth instar. independently of the foliar endophyte. They accelerated larval development slightly. The foliar endophyte increased the survivorship of fifth-instar larvae, independently of mycorrhizae.
   We concluded that both foliar endophytes and mycorrhizae affected larval growth and survivorship. Some effects were additive, while others were nonadditive and depended to some extent on host P nutrition. Our findings suggest that the beneficial effect of the foliar endophyte on the host plant, in terms of insect resistance, was reduced but not eliminated by mycorrhizae.

AB We present empirical evidence that the direct and indirect effects of species richness on ecological processes depend on a system's disturbance regime. We manipulated the number of species of freshwater suspension feeders (net-spinning caddisflies) in laboratory stream mesocosms where communities were either subject to a periodic mortality or were left undisturbed. We hypothesized that disturbance would alter the direct effect of suspension-feeder species richness on the flux of their resource, particulate organic matter (POM), and alter the indirect effects of suspension-feeder species richness on algal productivity and biofilm respiration (via nutrient recycling). The direct effect of suspension-feeder species richness on POM flux did indeed change with disturbance regime. The flux of POM from the water column to stream bed was not influenced by species richness in the absence of disturbance, but increased as species richness was increased in disturbed streams. This apparently occurred because a high taxonomic evenness in disturbed streams minimized cut-rent "shading" (i.e., the blocking of flow from upstream to downstream neighbors) that, in turn, allowed diverse assemblages to capture a greater fraction of suspended resources. Disturbance also altered the indirect effect of suspension feeder species richness on algal productivity. In the absence of disturbance, increasing species richness led to dominance by a competitively superior suspension feeding taxon that had particularly low rates of nutrient excretion. Reduced nutrient availability, in turn, caused algal productivity to decline as a function of species richness. Periodic disturbances, however, prevented taxonomic dominance and eliminated this indirect effect of suspension feeder species richness on stream productivity. Our results suggest that disturbance can moderate relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning by (1) increasing the chance that diversity generates unique system properties (i.e., "emergent" properties), or (2) suppressing the probability of ecological processes being controlled by a single taxon (i.e., the "selection-probability" effect).

AB Community convergence across biogeographic ally distinct regions suggests the existence of key, repeated, evolutionary mechanisms relating community characteristics to the environment. However, convergence studies at the community level often involve only qualitative comparisons of the environment and may fail to identify which environmental variables drive community structure. We tested the hypothesis that the biological traits of fish communities on two continents (Europe and North America) are similarly related to environmental conditions. Specifically, from observations of individual fish made at the microhabitat scale (a few square meters) within French streams, we generated habitat preference models linking traits of fish species to local scale hydraulic conditions (Froude number). Using this information, we then predicted how hydraulics and geomorphology at the larger scale of stream reaches (several pool-riffle sequences) should quantitatively influence the trait composition of fish communities. Trait composition for fishes in stream reaches with low Froude number at low flow or high proportion of pools was predicted as nonbenthic, large, fecund, long-lived, nonstreamlined, and weak swimmers, We tested our predictions in contrasting stream reaches in France (n = 11) and Virginia, USA (11 = 76), using analyses of covariance to quantify the relative influence of continent vs. physical habitat variables on fish traits.
   The reach-scale convergence analysis indicated that trait proportions in the communities differed between continents (up to 55% of the variance in each trait was explained by "continent"), partly due to distinct evolutionary histories. However, within continents, trait proportions were comparably related to the hydraulic and geomorphic variables (up to 54% of the variance within continents explained). In particular, a synthetic measure of fish traits in reaches was well explained (50% of its variance) by the Froude number independently of the continent. The effect of physical variables did not differ across continents for most traits, confirming our predictions qualitatively and quantitatively, Therefore, despite phylogenetic and historical differences between continents, fish communities of France and Virginia exhibit convergence in biological traits related to hydraulics and geomorphology. This convergence reflects morphological and behavioral adaptations to physical stress in streams.
   This study supports the existence of a habitat template for ecological strategies. Some key quantitative variables that define this habitat template can be identified by characterizing how individual organisms use their physical environment, and by using dimensionless physical variables that reveal common energetic properties in different systems. Overall, quantitative tests of community convergence are efficient tools to demonstrate that some community traits are predictable from environmental features.

AB Despite their promise for simulating natural complexity, individual-based models (IBMs) are rarely used for ecological research or resource management. Few IBMs have been shown to reproduce realistic patterns of behavior by individual organisms. To test our IBM of stream salmonids and draw conclusions about foraging theory, we analyzed the IBM's ability to reproduce six patterns of habitat selection by real trout in simulations contrasting three alternative habitat-selection objectives: maximizing current growth rate, Current probability, or "expected maturity" (EM). EM is the product of (1) predicted survival of starvation and other mortality risks over a future time horizon, and (2) the fraction of reproductive size attained over the time horizon. Minimizing the ratio of mortality risk to growth rate was not tested as a habitat-selection rule because it produces nonsensical results when any habitat yields negative growth rates. The IBM simulates habitat selection in response to spatial and temporal variation in mortality risks and food availability as fish compete for food. The model fish move each daily time step to maximize their habitat-selection objective with no other restrictions (e.g., territoriality) imposed.
   Simulations with habitat selected to maximize growth reproduced three of the six habitat-selection patterns; maximizing survival reproduced two patterns; and maximizing EM reproduced all six patterns. Two patterns (shifts in habitat with Changes in temperature and food availability) were not reproduced by the objectives that consider only current growth and risk but were explained by the EM objective that considers how future starvation risk depends on current energy reserves and energy intake. In 75-d simulations, population-level survival and biomass accumulation were hi-hest for fish moving to maximize EM. These results support the basic assumptions of state-based dynamic-model in g approaches to habitat selection. Our IBM appears successful because it avoids restrictive assumptions, incorporates competition for food, assumes salmonids make good habitat-selection decisions at a daily time step, and uses a habitat objective (EM) that provides reasonable trade-offs between growth and mortality risks.

In an illustration of its use, the method is applied to published meta-analyses of terrestrial plant competition, predation in streams, woody plant growth under elevated CO,, and marine nutrient enrichment experiments. Statistically significant associations of effect strength and journal quality were found in two of the four meta-analyses.

AB The "restricted-movement paradigm" (RMP) states that adult fish in streams are sedentary and spend most of their lives in short (20-50 m) reaches of stream. In mark-recapture studies. however, many fish initially marked are often never recaptured. As well, turnover rates of individuals in the home section (where fish were originally marked) can be high when marked fish moving out are rapidly replaced by unmarked ones. Recent challenges to the RMP have been based on the inference that high turnover indicates high mobility. However, when the home section is small many individuals may leave (high turnover) but not move far away (low displacement). I present two models for the frequency distribution of displacement distances: one represents populations as homogeneous ensembles with a single mobility parameter; the second represents populations as a mixture of stationary and mobile individuals. Both readily distinguish the turnover and displacement components of movement and show that high turnover rate is compatible with low displacement. The models were then fit to dispersal curves for six species of stream salmonids in 27 populations. Empirical estimates of turnover rate were high (median: 0.53), variable among populations (range: 0.15-0.78), but unrelated to displacement distance. Median displacement was < 100 In for 24 populations and was typically < 50 m. The proportion of mobile individuals was low in most populations (median: 19%) and exceeded 50% in only five of the populations. Brook trout, a species central to studies critical of the RMP appeared to be exceptionally mobile relative to other salmonids. The compatibility of high turnover rates with short displacement distances and the finding that median displacement was usually limited support the notion that restricted movement is the norm in populations of stream salmonids during nonmigratory periods. However, the finding of considerable intra- and interspecific heterogeneity in the extent of movement underscores the potential importance of the mobile component to population processes. By providing an analytical framework that yields quantitative measures of different components of movement and allows for standardized comparisons, these models can bring needed rigor to analysis and design in movement studies.

AB Ecosystem dynamics unfold into the future but are understood by examining the past. A forward looking ecology, which assesses a broad range of possible future ecosystem states, is the complement of long-term, historical approaches to ecology. Together they are the ecology of the long now. The "long now" of ecosystems includes historical influences that shape present ecologies, and the future consequences of present events. As a step in testing theories by their consequences, prediction is widely used in ecology. Ecologists have developed, criticized, and improved many predictive theories. Ecologists also have developed many empirical relationships that are potentially useful in forecasting. Eutrophication is an example of a problem for which ecologists created fundamental understanding, predictive capability, and new options for management. Ecologists frequently justify their research funding through appeals to improved predictability. This goal is sometimes attainable and in any case motivates a considerable body of insightful research. However, in many cases of environmental decision making, what ecologists cannot predict is at least as important as what can be predicted. It is important to assess the full range of changes in ecosystems that may plausibly occur in the future, and the implications of these changes. The paper discusses some ways that ecological information can be used to improve understanding of the future consequences of present choices.

AB J. M. Diamond's assembly rules model predicts that competitive interactions between species lead to nonrandom co-occurrence patterns. We conducted a meta-analysis of 96 published presence-absence matrices and used a realistic "null model" to generate patterns expected in the absence of species interactions. Published matrices were highly nonrandom and matched the predictions of Diamond's model: there were fewer species combinations, more checkerboard species pairs, and less co-occurrence in real matrices than expected by chance. Moreover, nonrandom structure was greater in homeotherm vs. poikilotherm matrices. Although these analyses do not confirm the mechanisms of Diamond's controversial assembly rules model, they do establish that observed co-occurrence in most natural communities is usually less than expected by chance. These results contrast with previous analyses of species co-occurrence patterns and bridge the apparent gap between experimental and correlative studies in community ecology.

AB Given the drastic decline in biodiversity at all levels, it is imperative that we consider the potential effects of diversity within single species on ecosystem functioning However, empirical data describing the relationship between intraspecific diversity and ecosystem functioning are lacking. We present field data demonstrating that the litter phenotype of individual trees affects carbon and nitrogen fluxes during decomposition, and that single-phenotype treatments differ in ecosystem processes from a phenotypic mix. Since nutrient dynamics are related to the chemistry of the litter, we then used the strength of the relationship between genetic distance and litter chemistry to infer the existence of genotypic effects on ecosystem functioning. In combination, our results provide the first evidence that losses in intraspecific diversity can affect the ecosystem processes of carbon and nitrogen cycling.

AB Two central debates in marine ecology concern the role of connectivity patterns via larval dispersal in structuring marine metapopulations and the relative importance of larval supply vs. events occurring during or after settlement in determining adult abundance. Both issues were examined using age-structured models and Simulations of reef fish population dynamics at the regional scale of closed Metapopulations and the local scale of individual reeds. Local populations on individual reefs were assumed to be at once both partially open and partially closed. Two sets of models over both spatial scales are presented. One set examines density-independent dynamics. In the other set, mortality in the first year depends on the density of the settling cohort. and the density dependence is compensatory.
   The sensitivities of local population dynamics to the rates of self-recruitment and external larval supply were predicted. If external larval supply is regular and there is little self-recruitment. then a local population can appear to be regulated without conventional forms of density dependence. Elsewhere, this process has been termed "recruitment regulation." However. with increased self-recruitment a local population will grow without bound in the absence of regulatory density dependence.
   Metapopulation persistence requires a sufficiently strong linkage between stock and recruitment in some local population. In such a local population, individuals must contribute sufficiently many offspring to replace themselves locally in subsequent generations. Such a local population could either be partially closed or lie in a region of the metapopulation that is strongly interconnected. Metapopulation regulation requires that density dependence acts to curb population growth in local source populations but does not require that it acts in local sink populations. The density dependence need not be so strong as to prevent subsequent cohort sizes from correlating well with varying recruitment levels. Recruitment regulation alone cannot regulate a metapopulation.
   Two versions of the recruitment limitation hypothesis were examined. The first version L states that varying recruitment levels are good predictors of subsequent population size; the second version states that postrecruitment demographic rates are density independent. The present models, along with a growing body of empirical data, support the first hypothesis but provide less support for the second one. Population regulation and the first form of recruitment limitation are not antithetical processes.

AB During mark-recapture studies of open populations, animals often temporarily emigrate from study areas. Such temporary emigration can cause biased estimates of survival probabilities. We present a new statistical method to estimate survival probability from the capture histories of marked individuals in the presence of temporary emigration. This method uses stage-structured models that include one or more stages representing the individuals that have temporarily emigrated. Although not all parameters can be estimated in such stage structures, some important parameters are still estimable. Here, we determined the estimability of parameter values from the rank of the Jacobian of the likelihood function. We applied the temporary-emigration mark-recapture method to artificial data, representing various life histories and demonstrated consistency between actual and estimated values. As an example, we used the method to analyze data on reproductive female North Atlantic right whales. The method presented in this paper will be especially useful for, studies of seabird, sea turtle, and marine-mammal populations where individuals are sampled only on their breeding grounds.

AB Ecotones have been considered as unique environments, and the concepts of edge effect and ecotonal species have been widely used, especially in avian community ecology. We studied the patterns of bird densities across heath-wood edges at replicated sites in three locations in southeastern Australia. Multivariate analysis showed that the bird community in the ecotone was intermediate between the heath and wood communities, indicating that the ecotone contained a mixing of species rather than a unique bird community. ANOVA showed a modest increase in bird density at the wood side of the ecotone, which may be partly due to sampling biases rather than to some inherent habitat value in the ecotone. The outstanding pattern was that bird density and species richness in the wood habitat were twice as high as in the heath habitat. Of a total of 86 species, 31 occurred in sufficient numbers to categorize according to their habitat association (generalist, or heath or wood specialist) and their density at the ecotone (ecotone neutral, ecotone shy, or ecotone conspicuous). Three of these were habitat-generalist-ecotone-neutral. Fourteen species were ecotone neutral but were habitat specialists on either the wood (13 spp.) or the heath (1 sp.). Three species were ecotone shy. Although 11 species were ecotone conspicuous, they also occurred in either heath or wood or both. Thus, no species could be categorized as entirely ecotonal. We conclude that there is little evidence from this or other studies of avian communities to support an edge effect of increased density and species richness, and no evidence,of entirely ecotonal species.

AB The mere presence of predators often decreases the growth rate of prey individuals, which devote energy and time to predator avoidance mechanisms. However, if time constraints are present, the prey individuals might be forced to neglect predators in order to grow faster. Amphibian larvae lower their activity when exposed to predators, which increases their survival probability but lowers their growth rate. I investigated how time constraints affect the growth strategies of pool frogs (Rana lessonae) in the presence and absence of caged (i.e., nonlethal) predators, and what the consequences are for their survival during the larval and the subsequent terrestrial life stage. In two outdoor experiments, I limited the available development time by delaying the hatching date, and by simulating pond drying. Tadpoles whose hatching date was experimentally delayed reduced their development and their activity less in the presence of predators than did control tadpoles. The survival consequences of caged predators was similar for early- and late-hatched tadpoles. Tadpoles exposed to failing water level increased their developmental rate compared to constant-water-level controls. In response to predators, however, tadpoles decreased activity and developmental rate, regardless of the water level treatment. Survival in treatments combining fast drying and caged predators was lower than in the other treatments These results suggest that time constraints critically affect the role of predators in the life history of pool frogs and might change the relative importance of lethal and nonlethal predator effects on their population dynamics.

AB Life history theory predicts that organisms inhabiting environments with relatively poor conditions for the growth and survival of their offspring should produce fewer and larger offspring. We examined egg size (an index of offspring size) of all iteroparous, broadcast-spawning, freshwater fish-the walleye (Stizostedion vitreum)-from 34 populations across 26degrees of latitude in order to determine whether egg size varied with respect to environinental indices of juvenile habitat quality. Variation among populations (among environments) was compared to variation within populations (among females). Within Populations, egg size generally increased with maternal size and age. Slopes of these relationships were much more variable among populations (cv > 100%) than interannually within populations (cv < 50%). Egg size vs. female size/age correlations were stronger in populations closer to the northern and southern limits of the walleye range. Egg size was also related to maternal growth history, but the effects of recent growth (previous year) were inconsistent. Egg size varied much less than fecundity among females of the same Population. For a standard size/age of female, predicted egg size was more variable among populations (cv > 10%) than interannually within Populations (cv < 5%), but only slightly more variable than among females within populations (mean cv = 8.5%). Nevertheless, among-population variability in egg size was related to environmental conditions. Mean egg size decreased with increasing latitude/decreasing mean annual temperature, contrary to our predictions. However, as predicted, egg size decreased with increasing lake productivity following adjustment for the latitudinal/temperature effect. These results suggest that egg size in fishes may be influenced by multiple environmental factors across populations, as well as by maternal effects within populations.

AB We examined species density gradients of ants of New England in 22 ombrotrophic bogs and their surrounding forests. We tested the hypothesis that species density was correlated with large-scale geographic variables (latitude, longitude, elevation) and small-scale site variables (habitat area, vegetation composition, light availability). Species density was consistently higher in forests than in bogs. Ant species density measured in three other New World studies yielded similar results, with steeper diversity slopes in closed canopy vs. open habitats. In New England bogs and forests, latitude was the single most important predictor of species density, even though the latitudinal span of the entire study region was less than three degrees. Diversity patterns documented in our study of mid-latitude ant communities are similar to those seen in studies spanning tropical and temperate habitats. Species density of forest ants was associated strongly with latitude, elevation, light availability, and vegetation composition. Species density of bog ants was less predictable, and was correlated only with latitude and vegetation. Overall, our results suggest that species-energy relationships are important at regional spatial scales. Explanations for the latitudinal gradient in ant species density may not depend on unique differences between tropical and temperate communities, but could operate at all latitudes.

AB The spatial distribution of tree seeds is influenced by the behavior of seed dispersers and seed-killing agents. In this study we evaluated the relative importance of multiple seed-killing agents on changes in the spatial pattern of Fagus crenata seeds. The dispersal of seeds and causes of seed death following dispersal were investigated on a 0.6-ha study plot in northern Japan. Seeds were collected using seed traps (n = 110) in the autumn of 1995, as well as directly from the A(0) layer of the soil, including leaf litter, intermediate, and humus layers (n = 110), in the spring of 1996. A total of 44 075 seeds were disseminated into the seed traps, including 17 964 mature seeds; 15% of these were viable the following spring, indicating a large decrease in the abundance of viable seeds during the post-dispersal seed stage. Spatial association of undamaged seeds changed from a positive to independent association between the different dispersal stages, indicating rearrangement of the spatial pattern of seeds through time. During this period, numbers of living seeds generally decreased beneath conspecific adults compared to those located away from the adults. This chan-e resulted from the spatially different behavior of several biotic and abiotic killing agents. Rodents and fungi attacked the seeds, depending on seed densities and presence of conspecific adult crowns, respectively, but desiccation was independent of both seed density and conspecific crowns. The multiple killing agents with different spatial behavior jointly influenced the distributions of recruits entering tree populations.

AB The advent of genetically modified organisms such as pathogens has raised ecological questions that need to be addressed in order to assess any risks involved in their use, The baculovirus Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcNPV), which infects a number of lepidopteran species, has been modified to express an insect-selective toxin, This genetic modification increases the speed with which it kills its host. However, in addition to this intended feature of the modified virus, there may be other consequences for the host-pathogen interaction. We report a field experiment in which transmission patterns of the wild-type and the genetically modified baculovirus are measured within and between a model target (susceptible) and nontarget (less susceptible) lepidopteran species. Two foliar feeders were chosen: Trichoplusia ni, the cabbage looper, is highly susceptible to this pathogen, while Mamestra brassicae, the cabbage moth, is semipermissive. These two species are used as both the source and the recipients of infection for both virus types. A series of models are fitted to determine the probabilities of infection (given survival from other sources of mortality) over a 7-d period within contained field cages. Fitting these models to data illustrates teat a substantial fraction of the population escapes infection, and it is the size of the pathogen-free refuge that varies between treatments. When infected individuals from the less susceptible species die, the yield of virus is greater than from susceptible hosts, yet this does not significantly alter the risk of transmission to other hosts. In contrast, the genetically modified baculovirus always results in a lower risk of infection in the field compared to the wild type. This is because the recombinant virus causes paralysis, and as a result, the cadaver may fall from the plant before death and virus release. Hence the number of cadavers remaining on the foliage has a greater influence on transmission than the yield of virus from those cadavers.

AB In western Europe, forest area has been expanding rapidly since the 19th century, mainly on former agricultural land. Previous studies show that plant diversity differs between these recent forests and ancient forests that were already forested at the time of first national cadastral surveys, around 1800. Here, we investigated the duration of such agricultural aftereffects. In northeastern France, large areas were deforested during the Roman occupation and thereafter abandoned to forest. In one such forest that was farmed during the period AD 50-250, we show that species richness and plant communities vary according to the intensity of former agriculture. These variations are linked to long-erm changes of chemical and structural soil properties. Hence, we suggest that such effects of past agricultural land use on forest biodiversity may be irreversible on an historical time scale.

AB Theory predicts that allochthonous energy subsidies. can modify the strength of trophic cascades in food webs. We tested the hypothesis that a detrital subsidy would enhance trophic cascades in the grazing food web of an agroecosystem in which generalist predators, wolf spiders and carabid beetles, feed both on detritivores and. herbivores. We crossed detritus-addition with predator-removal treatments in replicated 8 x 8 m open and fenced plots of,cucumbers and squash. Collembola, a major detritivore, became 2-4 times more abundant in detritus-addition than control plots; densities of other detritivores also increased. Although the detrital subsidy initially increased ground beetle numbers and produced a 2-3-fold increase in wolf spider densities, we found no consistent evidence of strong trophic cascades measured as changes in fruit yield in either detritus-addition or predator-removal treatments. This result contrasts with predator-removal experiments in previous years in the same study area, which revealed strong cascades affecting cucumber yield-We hypothesize that (1) competition between cucurbits and fungi for nitrogen in the detritus-addition plots, (2) unusually high herbivore densities in the spring cucumber crop, and low densities on the summer squash crop, (3) changes in patterns of intraguild predation in the detritus-addition plots, and (4) perhaps a switch. by generalist predators to prey of the detrital food web all may have contributed to preventing the detrital subsidy from benefiting primary producers via an enhanced, trophic cascade.

AB Previous investigations have shown that the sedentary amphipod Ampithoe longimana escapes consumers by selectively living on and eating chemically defended seaweeds in the genus Dictyota. However, A. longimana and Dictyota overlap only in the southern portion of the amphipod's range; Dictyota is not available to amphipods from more northerly regions. We used this disjunction in distribution to test the hypothesis that A. longimana populations co-occurring with Dictyota would have greater tolerance for the seaweed.'s chemical defenses and would display higher feeding preference for, and fitness on, the seaweed than would more northerly populations. We also evaluated the genetic vs. phenotypic basis of these patterns and attempted to detect trade-offs between tolerance for Dictyota and ability to use other plants as foods. Such geographic studies of herbivory have been conducted using terrestrial insects, but few studies have focused on other herbivores, and this is especially true for marine systems, In multiple-choice feeding assays with both field-collected and laboratory-reared adults, a North Carolina population of A. longimana sympatric with Dictyota more readily fed on Dictyota and was more resistant to Dictyota's deterrent chemistry than was a Connecticut population from outside of Dictyota's geographic range. When raised on Dictyota menstrualis and D. ciliolata, A. longimana juveniles from North Carolina grew faster, matured faster, and produced more reproductivefemales than did Connecticut juveniles. The differential tolerance for Dictyota, has a genetic basis, as it was maintained through two generations grown to maturity in a common environment. When several northern and southern populations were assayed, they displayed similar regional differences in feeding preferences.
   Though southern juveniles had higher fitness on Dictyota than northern juveniles, southern juveniles performed as well as northern juveniles when raised on seven other seaweeds, including seaweeds (e.g., Fucus vesiculosus and Sargassum filipendula) that produce secondary metabolites in a different class from those found in Dictyota. Thus, tolerating Dictyota did not incur detectable performance trade-offs when juveniles were confined to feeding on alternative seaweeds. Our results suggest that the evolution of host preferences may depend more on the host value as a refuge from enemies than on minimizing the costs of tolerating plant secondary metabolites.

AB In desert ecosystems a large proportion of water and nitrogen is supplied in rain-induced pulses. It has been suggested that competitive interactions among desert plants would be most intense during these pulse periods of high resource availability. We tested this hypothesis with three cold desert shrub species of the Colorado Plateau (Gutierrezia sarothrae, Atriplex confertifolia. and Chrysothamnus nauseosus), which differ in their distribution of functional roots. In a three-year field study we conducted a neighbor removal experiment in conjunction with simulated 25-mm precipitation events and the addition of a nitrogen pulse. in either spring or summer. We measured predawn water potential (Psi), gas exchange, leaf delta(15)N, carbon isotope discrimination (Delta), and growth of target plants for the duration of the study. We found that G. sarothrae used resource pulses to a larger extent than A. confertifolia, which has more functional roots at depth. In all species, the addition of a water or nitrogen pulse did not significantly affect maximal rates of photosynthesis or branch growth. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, we did not find that pulse use was reduced by the presence of neighboring plants. Nevertheless, there was strong evidence for competitive interactions, which were more likely mediated by water at depth than by nitrogen. in the more deep-rooted species A. confertifolia, neighbor removal affected T, gas exchange, Delta, percentage of carbon, and growth. G. sarothrae, which has a much smaller proportion of roots at depth, was less affected by the removal of neighboring shrubs, and not at all when only predominantly shallow-rooted herbaceous species were removed.
   These results suggest that shrubs in this cold desert community may primarily compete for water in deeper soil layers, where water depletion is slow and dominated by plant water uptake. There appeared to be little competition for water in shallow soil layers, where depletion is fast and dominated by evaporation.

AB The nesting habitat of most freshwater turtle species has been described, but I-actors influencing maternal nest site selection have rarely been tested experimentally. Offspring fitness is assumed to be the major factor influencing, nest site selection because habitat characteristics and nest microenvironments affect offspring survival. However, two opposing factors drive maternal nest site selection: minimizing female mortality and maximizing offspring fitness. In Australia, introduced red foxes are the major predator of turtle nests, and they also destroy nesting females. Thus, females may trade off maximizing nest survival or offspring fitness to avoid predators. In this paper, I show that the risk of predation affects maternal nest site selection and has negative effects on reproductive success in a freshwater turtle. I also show that the mechanisms behind predator detection vary between native and introduced species. From 1996 to 2000, 1 observed female freshwater turtles, Emydura macquarii, nesting around four lagoons in southeastern Australia to determine nesting habitat characteristics. During 1997 and 1998, foxes were removed from two sites, and nest predation rates declined by >50% , but remained >85% in nonremoval sites. Foxes destroyed similar to3% of the female population only in high-risk areas. Female turtles nest away from shore to maximize offspring fitness when foxes are removed from an area. The dilemma in high-risk areas is that predation risk limits females from nesting in preferred areas away from shore, where nest predation is reduced. However, females may sacrifice some offspring by nesting in inappropriate substrate, where incubation conditions are not optimal, but nest predation is significantly reduced. Nesting turtles do not detect foxes by chemical recognition, but they have an innate avoidance response to the odor of a native predator. Nesting habitat affects offspring fitness, but factors affecting female survival may ultimately drive maternal nest site selection in turtles.

AB Phenotypic plasticity may enable organisms to optimize their phenotypes in environments that are heterogeneous over time or space. For example, inducible defenses are favored for prey populations faced with variable predation risk. We studied the impact of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) on the development of defensive morphological characters in larvae of the mayfly, Drunella coloradensis, both in natural streams and in a series of experiments carried out in streamside, circular, flow-through chambers. Drunella larvae in natural streams with trout had Ion-er caudal filaments per unit body size and relatively heavier exoskeletons than Drunella in fishless streams. Female larvae that developed in fish streams were also significantly smaller and less fecund at metamorphosis than those living in fishless streams, suggesting a possible fitness cost associated with development of morphological defenses. However, timing of metamorphosis of Drunella larvae to the adult stage did not differ between fish and fishless streams.
   Larvae originating from fish and fishless streams were reared and exposed to water with fish cues or fishless control water for three weeks (1998) or until they developed black wing pads, i.e., just before emergence (1999). In both experiments waterborne fish cues induced the development of relatively longer caudal filaments, but only in Drunella originating from sites without fish. Waterborne fish cues had no effect oil Drunella growth rates, behavior, or size at emergence. Drunella originating from fish streams had significantly lower mortality when exposed to predation by trout than Drunella originating from fishless streams. Caudal filament length appears to enhance survival, as Drunella with intact caudal filaments had lower predation rates than Drunella with their tails artificially shortened. This study provides evidence of chemically induced morphological plasticity that could reduce predation rates of these mayflies in natural stream environments.

AB Despite substantial divergence, the European toads Bombina bombilla and Bombina variegata (Anura: Discoglossidae) interbreed freely wherever their parapatric distributions adjoin. Natural selection that stabilizes the resulting hybrid zones should rest in part on the adaptation to different breeding habitat of the pure taxa. While B. bombilla lays its eggs in semipermanent ponds, B. variegata is a typical puddle breeder. Here, we investigate whether selection for rapid larval development in B. variegata has resulted in the loss of effective antipredator defenses, thus excluding this species from predator-rich ponds. We collected adults from four populations in Romania (two for each taxon) and reared the offspring from four crosses per population in the laboratory either in the presence or in the absence of caged odonate predators (Aeshna cyanea). In predation trials, we found no taxon difference in mortality rate among tadpoles that had been reared with predators. The resilience of B. variegata tadpoles may have been due to their remarkable phenotypic plasticity. In both taxa, predator presence led to the development of a higher tail fin, which has been shown to reduce predation rates in other amphibians. This response was much stronger in B. variegata than in B. bombina. Moreover, differences between the two B. variegata populations in terms of laboratory predation rates and levels of plasticity correlated with predator abundance at the collection sites so as to suggest local adaptation in predator defenses. Finally, delayed metamorphosis in the predator-induced morphs of both taxa implies a cost to the defense. Given the heterogeneity of temporary habitat in terms of desiccation rate and predator occurrence, the greater amount of phenotypic plasticity in B. variegata fits predictions of life history theory. At the same time, our results leave the question unresolved as to why this species avoids ponds.

AB Propagule dispersal in seaweeds is a process influenced by a variety of biological and physical factors, the complexity of which has hindered efforts to understand colonization, persistence, post-disturbance recovery, and dynamics of algal populations in general. In view of this limitation, we employ here modifications to an existing turbulent-transport model to explore the mechanics of nearshore macroalgal spore dispersal and its relationship to coastal hydrodynamic conditions, Our modeling efforts focus on four example species of seaweed whose reproductive propagules span a wide range in sinking speed and height of release above the sea floor: the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, the erect fucoid Sargassum muticum, the small Filamentous brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus, and the flaccid red alga Sarcodiotheca gaudichaudii. Results indicate that both propagule sinking speed and release height can affect dispersal distance substantially, but that the influence of these biological parameters is modulated strongly by the intensity of turbulence as dictated by waves and currents. In rapid flows with larger waves, it is primarily fluid dynamic processes, in particular current velocities, that determine dispersal distance. Additional Simulations suggest that patterns of spore dispersal are highly skewed, with most propagules encountering the sea floor within a few meters to hundreds of meters of their parents, but with a sizeable fraction of spores also dispersing as far as kilometers. Such model predictions imply a much greater potential for longer range dispersal than has typically been assumed, a finding with important implications for understanding the demographics of algal populations and for predicting levels of connectivity among them.

AB We investigated patterns of mammal assemblage structure on the Atherton Tableland in the Wet Tropics biogeographic region of northeastern Australia. We used live trapping and quantitative estimates of stratified vegetation density to examine the relationships between the structure of the mammal assemblage and habitat structure over three nested spatial scales across a natural vegetation gradient from rain forest to dry, open forest. The narrow transition zone enabled us to examine the relationships between mammal assemblage structure and habitat structure while minimizing the confounding effects of distance, climate, and biogeographic history. The structure of the mammal assemblages was closely related to vegetation structure across and within habitats, and over all spatial scales examined. Vegetation complexity and heterogeneity both influenced assemblage structure, but the relationships varied with spatial scale, Species richness was highest in the open forest and decreased across the gradient into the rain forest. Point diversity was only weakly explained by vegetation structure, whereas >80% of the variation in species richness at the local scale could be explained by vegetation structure. Local-scale species richness of ground-dwelling mammals was mostly a product of the spatial variability in assemblage structure (beta diversity), which was associated with the spatial variability in vegetation structure. Local-scale liabitat heterogeneity thus promoted local-scale species richness via the close ecological interaction between mammals and habitat structure. The multiscale approach used here, and the nesting of spatial variability in within-habitat vegetation structure, enabled us to demonstrate the scale-dependent effects of spatial habitat heterogeneity and complexity on the structure and diversity of the small-mammal assemblage.

AB Models of habitat selection have been developed primarily for mobile animals with well-defined home ranges. The assumptions made by traditional techniques about habitat availability are inappropriate for species with low mobility and large home ranges, such as the wood turtle. We used paired logistic regression, typically used in medical case - control studies, to model selection of habitat within activity areas in a population of wood turtles in a watershed in western Maine. We also modeled selection of activity areas within the watershed, using nonpaired logistic regression. Within activity areas, wood turtles selected nonforested locations close to water with low canopy cover. Within the watershed, they selected activity areas close to streams and rivers with moderate forest cover and little open water. The difference between selection at these two scales suggests that wood turtles select forest edges to balance thermoregulatory and feeding needs. The model of selection of activity areas within the watershed correctly classified 84% of activity areas and random areas. This model may be useful for identifying wood turtle habitat across the landscape as part of regional conservation efforts. We suggest that paired logistic regression shows promise for analysis of habitat selection of species with movement patterns that violate the assumptions of traditional habitat selection models.

AB Few studies have examined survivorship of animals in forest fragments differing in size, and none has used appropriate mark-recapture analysis techniques taking into account probability of recapture. Using Program MARK, a flexible mark-recapture software package, we estimated annual survival rates of four permanent-resident woodland bird species over a 5-yr period in a fragmented landscape. For Carolina Chickadees, White-breasted Nuthatches, and Downy Woodpeckers, the probability of survival was related to site. with survival being highest in large woodlots, low in small woodlots, and either intermediate or lower in riparian woodlands. The presence of supplemental food had a positive influence on survivorship. Survivorship of the Tufted Titmouse was lower in years with heavy snow cover. There was some evidence for an age difference in apparent survival, with adult birds having higher survival rates. Overall, however, these age-specific estimates had large variances or the differences disappeared when models were averaged, except in the chickadee, where young birds appeared to survive less well in forested river corridors. This last result was quite likely due, at least in part, to age-specific dispersal, suggesting that river corridors function as important dispersal routes for young, transient birds of permanent-resident species. These results suggest a strong additional cost of fragmentation: increased mortality. This cost has not been previously documented using modern mark-recapture analytical techniques.

AB The changes in the size structure of a cohort of individuals through time can have important population-level consequences, but the determinants of patterns of variation in individual size are not well understood. We use an individual-based simulation model to determine what factors can lead to changes in the variability in size among individuals through time, with attention paid to those factors that increase variability. A pattern of increasing size variability over time (i.e., growth depensation) has been documented in a variety of taxa. Size-dependent growth has generally been advanced as the explanation for its occurrence. We evaluated the independent and interactive effects of size-dependent growth factors, positive temporal correlates in growth (termed "growth autocorrelation"), and environmental stochasticity in generating growth depensation. In contrast to expectation, our results indicate that size-dependent growth is not the major contributor to changing variability patterns. Instead, our simulations indicate that growth autocorrelation is often the major determinant causing growth depensation. Data collected from the kelp Alaria nana and the whelk Nucella canaliculata showed evidence for positive correlations in growth (independent of size), while the tidepool sculpin Oligocottus maculosus does not. The changes in size variability in these three species (increasing size variability through time in A. nana only) were consistent with model predictions. Our results emphasize a need to disentangle size-related processes from other correlates of growth in field populations and to document how these phenomena are affected by environmental stressors and intraspecific interactions.

AB Food availability has been proposed as one of the main factors regulating population sizes in birds. Seabirds have provided evidence for the hypothesis that food. depletion due to intraspecific competition explains variability in colony size. However, the predictions derived from this hypothesis have not been fully tested due mainly to the difficulties in measuring food availability in marine environments. We measured stable isotopes of nitrogen (delta(15)N) and carbon (delta(13)C) in the blood of Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus), which reveal information about their consumed prey and foraging habits. We tested if conspecific competition causes food depletion, affecting penguin breeding performance and; ultimately, the size of the colonies. Blood delta(15)N values of adults and chicks significantly decreased with increasing size of their colonies and with the number of conspecifics breeding within the parental foraging ranges. This suggests that high breeding densities provoke the depletion of high-quality prey (mainly anchovy). We also found positive relationships between delta(13)C values. and density of conspecifics within the parental foraging ranges, indicating that when competition for food is high, individuals tend to feed closer. to the colony on prey of lower quality. Adult delta(15)N values were positively correlated with breeding success at the colonies, which was negatively correlated with the density of conspecifics within foraging ranges. Moreover, delta(15)N values of fledglings were,positively correlated with their body condition but not with their T-cell mediated immune response considered as two measures of their survival prospects. This decreased breeding output was translated to the colony-size structure of the population, since colony size was negatively correlated with the number of conspecifics breeding within the parental foraging ranges. Therefore, we provide strong evidence suggesting that density-dependent food depletion determines the distribution of colony sizes in birds.

AB The energy cost of activities central to overall fitness in most animals, such as pedestrian locomotion, is traditionally measured in the laboratory and then extrapolated to field conditions for modeling or hypothesis-testing purposes. However, no accurate; direct, in situ validation of these extrapolations has been made on undisturbed animals. We present the first such validation here, on harvester ants (Messor pergandei). After measuring their energy parameters in the laboratory using a running tube, we measured the metabolic rate (MR) of a natural, undisturbed ant trail foraging through a respirometer chamber in the field. From temperature, ant numbers, ant masses, and foraging speeds (obtained through video analysis), we predicted trail MRs from separately obtained laboratory data and compared them to measured field trail MRs. No significant difference was found between actual field values and values predicted from equations produced from data acquired in the laboratory. Our results therefore serve to validate two unusual findings in ants, which would otherwise be troubling to extrapolate to field conditions: that their extrapolated MR at zero running speed does not differ from standard (resting) metabolic. rate, and that their costs of transport are far lower than predicted on the basis of current allometric equations.

AB The indirect effects of hosts on interactions between parasites and other species are not well understood, and it may be difficult to predict the outcome of host species effects on parasite performance due to the complexity of potential direct and indirect effects. For example, parasitic plants obtain defensive compounds as well as nutrients from their hosts, and thus many attributes of parasitic plants are dependent on the quality of their host species. Here I measure the effect of a lupine host species (Lupinus argenteus) compared to other host species on herbivory, pollination, and female plant fitness in the hemiparasite Indian paintbrush (Castilleja miniata) using a series of field experiments. Association with lupine was determined in the field by assaying Indian paintbrush leaves for lupine alkaloids. I found that Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing lupines experienced reduced herbivory from plume moth larvae, agromyzid fly larvae, and deer, relative to Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing other host species. However, there was no correlation between alkaloid content of inflorescences and plume moth performance. Host species did not affect pollinator preference for Indian paintbrush in the field. Indian paintbrush parasitizing lupines produced twice as many seeds overall as Indian paintbrush parasitizing other host species. Correlations suggest that this benefit arises both from reduced herbivory and increased nitrogenous resources. The reduction of herbivory in Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing lupines indicates that host species can affect performance of hemiparasites via indirect pathways, and that the larger community of herbivores could alter the impact of a host on its plant parasites.

AB Hypotheses concerning community-level vulnerability to invasion often emphasize biotic interactions but fail to consider fine-scale variation in the physical environment. In this study, the interplay between interspecific competition and abiotic factors is examined with respect to whether scrub habitats in southern California become invaded by the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). Argentine ants penetrate further into and attain higher abundances in mesic scrub fragments than they do in xeric scrub fragments. Probably as a result, native ant richness is lower in small (<30 ha), mesic fragments than in either small, xeric fragments or in small plots in unfragmented areas. Compared to six species of native ants, Argentine ants ranked lowest in their ability to tolerate high temperatures in the laboratory with 100% of field-collected workers dying after 60 min of exposure to temperatures greater than or equal to46degreesC. Field data corroborate these results; mean temperatures at which colonies of Argentine ants attained maximum abundance at baits (34.0degreesC) and abandoned baits (41.6degreesC) were both lower than for the native ant Dorymyrtnex insanus. Laboratory studies further revealed that low levels of soil moisture depress mean worker survival in experimental colonies of Argentine ants. In a factorial laboratory experiment that varied both physical conditions and interspecific competition, Argentine ants exhibited greater worker activity and survival under warm, moist conditions than under hot, dry conditions, whereas the presence of a competitor, Forelius mccooki, had no significant effect. Experimental colonies of F. mccooki, in contrast, were more active under hot, dry conditions than under warm, moist conditions and exhibited reduced activity in the presence of L. humile irrespective of physical conditions. Taken together, these experimental data demonstrate how the abiotic environment impinges on both colony-level activity and colony growth in the Argentine ant and provide a general explanation for the patterns observed at the community level. A key consequence of the condition-specific nature of the competitive asymmetry between Argentine ants and native ants is that community-level vulnerability to invasion appears to depend primarily on the suitability of the physical environment from the perspective of L. humile.

AB The theory of r- and K-selection was one of the first predictive models for life-history evolution. It helped to galvanize the empirical field of comparative life-history and dominated thinking on the subject from the late 1960s through the 1970s. Large quantities of field data were collected that claimed to test predictions of the theory. By the early 1980s, sentiment about the theory had changed so completely that a proposal to test it or the use of it to interpret empirical results would likely be viewed as archaic and naive. The theory was displaced,by demographic models that concentrated on mortality patterns as the cause of life-history evolution. Although demographic models are known for their density-independent approach and focus on extrinsic mortality, these models can incorporate many ecological features captured by r- and K-selection, such as density-dependent population regulation, resource availability, and environmental fluctuations. We highlight the incorporation of these factors in recent theory, then show how they are manifest in our research on life-history evolution in Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Explanations of the repeatable suites of life-history differences across populations of guppies originate from demographic models of predator-driven age-specific mortality. Recently, careful examination of guppy demography and habitat has revealed that density-dependent regulation and resource availability may have influenced the evolution of guppy life histories. In the field, these factors covary with predation risk; however, they can be uncoupled experimentally, providing insight into how they may have synergistically driven guppy life-history evolution. Although life-history theory has shifted away from a focus on r- and K-selection, the themes of density-dependent regulation, resource availability, and environmental fluctuations are integral to current demographic theory and are potentially important in any natural system.

AB Although many ecologists have discounted the possibility of communication between plants, recent work demonstrates that wild tobacco plants with experimentally clipped sagebrush neighbors suffer less leaf herbivory than tobacco controls with unclipped neighbors. In this report, we examine the fitness consequences of resistance induced by eavesdropping. Annual tobacco plants with clipped sagebrush neighbors produced more flowers and seed-bearing capsules than plants with unclipped neighbors although these performance measures varied considerably over the five years of the study. Tobacco plants with clipped neighbors also suffered more frost damage than controls in one year. There was no indication that eavesdropping was more beneficial to tobacco in years with high risk of herbivore damage. The potential adaptive benefits of eavesdropping remain unclear based on five years of data. However, the fact that eavesdropping had strong effects on herbivory and plant performance suggests that interactions between, plant species may be richer than we previously suspected.

AB Multiple-predator limitation of prey populations may be mediated by both predator-predator interactions and vegetation structure. Antagonistic interactions among predators, such as intraguild predation, can diminish the collective impact of natural enemies on prey population size. However, structurally complex vegetation may moderate such interactions by providing a refuge for predators, thereby enhancing prey suppression. Specifically, we examined the combined impact of two salt-marsh-inhabiting invertebrate predators, the mirid Tytthus vagus and the wolf spider Pardosa littoralis, on suppression of their shared prey, the planthopper Prokelisia dolus, in simple (thatch-free) and complex (thatch-rich) vegetation.
   In structurally simple habitats in the laboratory, the predators interacted antagonistically, due to the intraguild predation of mirids by spiders, and predation pressure on the planthopper population was relaxed. However, structurally complex habitats dampened this antagonistic interaction by providing a refuge for mirids from spider predation, thereby increasing the combined effectiveness of these predators in suppressing planthopper populations. Consistent with our laboratory results, we found enhanced co-occurrence of these predators in complex habitats in the field, where mirids are apparently at lower risk from spider predation and outbreaks of planthoppers are less likely. In contrast, in simple habitats, mirids were relatively less abundant, a finding consistent with the expectation of increased intraguild predation from spiders. Therefore, in this salt marsh system, complex vegetation diminished the occurrence of intraguild predation between mirids and spiders and increased overall enemy impact on their shared herbivore prey, demonstrating for the first time that plants can mediate enemy effects on insect herbivores by influencing predator-predator interactions.

AB Warmer regions generally exhibit greater rates of soil respiration and organic matter decomposition than colder regions. In the Great Plains of the United States, soil organic matter declines from the northern part of the region to the south, suggesting greater decomposition rates in areas with warmer temperatures. Our study used a regional data set of aboveground net primary production, soil organic carbon, soil texture, and climate to evaluate the environmental controls over areal patterns in decomposition rates, (k; expressed as grams per year per grain of initial mass), throughout the U.S. Great Plains. We conducted multiple regression analyses of steady-state k with respect to mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, and percentage soil clay content to examine both the combined and individual effects of these independent variables on regional decomposition rates.
   Our results indicated that precipitation contributes more than either temperature or soil texture to areal patterns of decomposition rates in the U.S. Great Plains, explaining >30% of the areal variability in k. Decomposition rates increased with increasing precipitation and with decreasing soil clay content. Temperature explained <8% of the regional variability in k. Ancillary analyses that related temperature and aboveground net primary production in the region indicated that plant productivity declines with increasing temperatures. This suggests that the reduction in soil organic matter to the south in the U.S. Great Plains may be due to reduced plant inputs rather than to increases in decomposition rates. The response of decomposition to temperature is probably constrained by moisture in this water-limited region. Therefore, changes in decomposition rates resulting from temperature dynamics are likely to be minimal unless they are accompanied by sufficient changes in precipitation.

AB Regional-scale variation of recruitment by marine organisms may reflect geographic patterns in adult stock sizes or fecundities, large-scale hydrodynamic features that influence the transport of larvae (e.g., currents, upwelling), and patterns of early mortality. In turn, recruitment may play a vital role in determining patterns of adult abundance and community structure, from local to biogeographic scales. We examined spatial variation in recruitment by corals at a regional scale, along 3300 km of the tropical and subtropical coast of eastern Australia (10degrees-31degrees S). We used two complementary approaches: (1) a meta-analysis of 21 different studies undertaken over a 16-yr period, each of which was generally conducted at a single reef, and (2) a large-scale sampling effort in which recruitment was measured in two years on 33 reefs arrayed along the length of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Our goal is to compare the emergent large-scale picture derived from many small-scale studies with patterns revealed by shorter-term regional sampling.
   The two approaches show very similar large-scale patterns. Recruitment by spawning corals (mainly acroporids) was highest in the central GBR and declined steadily with increasing latitude by up to more than 20-fold. A smaller decline occurred on the northern GBR between Australian and Papua New Guinea. Recruitment by brooding corals (mostly pocilloporids) was greatest in the northern GBR and also declined to the south. The latitudinal decline in brooders was three- to fivefold, i.e., not as great as for spawners. Consequently, the proportion of brooded recruits increased to the south, and they generally exceeded spawners on the southern GBR and on isolated subtropical reefs at higher latitudes. Our meta-analysis shows that fully half of the variation in the ratio of spawners to brooders is attributable to one of 11 variables that we extracted from the published studies: the month when the recruitment panels were deployed. This result suggests that the intensity and timing of spawning have a crucial impact on large-scale patterns of recruitment. Elsewhere, we tested this hypothesis in the field, and confirmed that regional variation in recruitment by spawning acroporid corals was driven by spatial and temporal variation in the extent of mass spawning. Together, large-scale sampling and meta-analyses provide a powerful, combined approach for investigating large-scale patterns and the mechanisms underlying them.

AB In order to estimate how much population extinction risk may be affected by local fragmentation, population viability analyses were performed in six populations of the endangered grassland herb Gentianella campestris in Sweden. The populations had been experimentally reintroduced to grasslands that were locally fragmented by-juniper shrubs. The sites represented three sizes of grassland and two levels of grassland abundance in the landscape. Five years' demographic data were evaluated in a stochastic matrix population model, and studies of seed set, pollinator abundance, and inbreeding depression were performed in order to examine possible links between population viability and pollination. In all six sites, plants with reduced capacity of self-pollination (due to herkogamy) showed strongly reduced population viability in locally fragmented grassland habit, with pronounced extinction thresholds at certain levels of local fragmentation. Population viability was reduced because of inbreeding depression and reduced seed production in combination, both caused by pollinator deficit in locally fragmented grasslands. Plants with high selfing capacity had low population viability over the entire local fragmentation gradierits. Selling yielded high seed set in the absence of pollinators and was advantageous in fragmented parts of the grasslands. However, selling had negative effects in nonfragmented parts of the grasslands, because it decreased the chances of cross-pollination and because selfed progeny had reduced fitness compared to outcrossed offspring. A comparison among the six sites indicated that the negative effects of local fragmentation were amplified by reduced size of the grassland sites and by reduced. abundance of grassland habitat in the landscape. To my knowledge, this is the first quantitative estimate of increased extinction risk in fragmented plant populations.

AB In vitro measurements, predictions, and geochemical estimates of the balance between gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration (CR) in the open ocean do not agree. This has generated an active debate about the carbon balance in unproductive pelagic marine ecosystems. The analysis of generalized GPP:CR relationships that sustains this debate assumes a continuous trophic gradient or the simple partition of the World Ocean into productive and unproductive regimes. We measured euphotic zone GPP and CR along a latitudinal (40degrees N-30degrees S) transect across the Atlantic Ocean, which included two open-ocean oligotrophic provinces: the eastern area of the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre (NAST-E) and the center of the South Atlantic Gyre (SATL). Net heterotrophy prevailed in the euphotic zone of the NAST-E, while the plankton community in the central SATL was net autotrophic. A review of published studies of net plankton metabolism in the open ocean substantiates this geographic pattern, suggesting the existence of different trophic dynamics in similarly unproductive planktonic communities that might be characterized by the relative importance of local vs. allochthonous sources of organic matter. No universal relationship appears to exist between the magnitude of photosynthesis of a pelagic ecosystem and its net metabolism. We tested the published GPP:CR relationships and found that each one was only able to correctly predict GPP:CR balances in either the heterotrophic NASTE or the autotrophic SATL, thus confirming that the geographic pattern in net community metabolism is related to the functional diversity of unproductive oceanic ecosystems.

AB Parasitic Brown-headed Cowbirds may reduce the reproductive success of their songbird hosts and thus threaten rare and frequently parasitized host populations with extinction.,The demographic impacts of cowbirds on hosts, however, have seldom been studied experimentally. We removed cowbirds to estimate how much they reduce the seasonal fecundity and population growth rates of a non-endangered cowbird host, the Song Sparrow. Over five control years, 61% of 515 spar-row nests were parasitized at three riparian study sites. When we removed female cowbirds from two of these sites, parasitism fell to 43% of 65 nests at Westham in 1996, to 30% of 117 nests at Westham in 1997, and 18% of 78 nests at Delta in 1998. The mean seasonal fecundity of sparrows increased from 1.67 fledglings per territory in controls to 3.40 fledglings per territory at Westham and from 1.23 to 3.16 fledglings per territory at Delta. At the third control site, Deas, seasonal fecundity averaged 2.07 fledglings per territory. The mean sizes of sparrow broods at fledging were increased in removal years from 0.53 to 0.95 young at Westham and from 0.47 to 1.15 young at Delta. Daily nest failure rates were reduced from 0.046 in control years. to 0.030 during cowbird removals at Westham and from. 0.049 to 0.035 at Delta. Survival over a 25-d nest cycle rose from an average of 0.32 in eight controls to 0.45 in three removals. Cowbird removals increased local population growth rates of song sparrows from well below replacement levels (lambda = 0.70-0.87) to a stable condition (X = 0.93-1.06). If cowbirds have similar or stronger effects on rarer and more vulnerable hosts, cowbird removal could improve the demographic performance of such hosts substantially.

AB Comparison of vegetation, soil, and climatic history at two sites differing in soil texture and thus soil water-holding capacity reveals long-term differences in terrestrial ecosystem development. Vegetation history reconstructed using pollen analysis and modern surface samples reveals that the site on till has hosted species with higher moisture requirements than those at the outwash site since the early Holocene. The outwash site had incomplete forest cover for much of the Holocene in contrast to the till site, which likely had a closed-canopy forest for most of its history. Comparison of vegetation and soil records reveals a correspondence between the timing of changes in vegetation and soil at both sites for most of the Holocene and provides evidence for greater weathering rates under coniferous than deciduous forest or savanna. Soil and vegetation changes are synchronous within, but not across, sites 13000-3000 yr BP, suggesting that local interactions between soil and vegetation may have been important in determining the timing of ecosystem change. In contrast, there was synchronous change in soil and vegetation across sites similar to3000 yr BP, when hemlock became established at the till site and weathering intensified at both sites. This synchrony suggests a regional driver of ecosystem change, most likely the climatic change to higher moisture availability that occurred in the late Holocene. Thus, both climate and interactions between soil and vegetation have influenced the timing of ecosystem change, and the relative importance of their influence has varied over time.

AB Plant populations often experience the joint effects of intraspecific competition and herbivory, yet the impact of the interaction of these two factors on the outcome of evolution is largely unknown. Here, we develop a spatially explicit simulation model to examine interactions between the evolution of herbivore resistance and competitive ability in the goldenrod Solidago altissima. We define competitive-ability. as either competitive effect, the ability of a plant to deplete resources and make them unavailable to competitors, or competitive response, the ability to grow, survive, and reproduce despite depletion of resources by neighboring competitors. We considered symmetric and asymmetric modes of competition and explored the following questions: (1) Does the selective effect of competition differ for the two components of competitive ability? (2) What are the effects of the evolution of competitive ability and resistance on each other? (3) Can trade-offs between competitive ability and resistance emerge, given no relationship between these two traits prior to selection? Our results showed that competitive response evolved quickly regardless of the mode of competition, but self-suppression hindered the evolution of competitive effect. The evolution of resistance appeared to be independent of the evolution of competitive ability. Intraspecific competition was the major selective force in our model. At natural levels of herbivory, selection for resistance played a secondary.role in structuring the population. Resistant genotypes were only favored at very low resistance costs. At high cost levels, the costs of maintaining resistance far outweighed the benefits. the selective forces of competition and herbivory resulted in trade-offs between competitive response and herbivore resistance, but only at low costs of resistance. Vigorous growth associated with a high competitive response might translate into trade-offs between herbivore tolerance and resistance. The strong selective effects of competitors, coupled with the weaker selection from herbivores, suggest that plant traits,directly associated with growth that confer tolerance to both competitors and consumers may be the targets of selection.

AB We present a framework for studying the evolution of state-dependent life history strategies in unpredictable environments. A dynamic energy budget model tracks the flow of energy through individuals and is parameterized using the rotifer species Brachionus calyciflorous. Ingested energy is allocated between new growth, energy reserves, and reproductive effort, in proportions determined by the organism's physiological state, leading to a three-way trade-off when food supplies are unpredictable. The model generates testable predictions regarding how variability in food affects optimal allocation strategies. There is selection for indeterminate growth and for norms of reaction in body size, storage, and age at maturity. Harsher environments select for smaller sizes and increased storage and, consequently, greater ability to withstand starvation. The model's predictions about body size, age at maturity, and effects of food deprivation are consistent with experimental results for B. calyciflorous, indicating that these life history traits have all been shaped by evolution of energy allocation and storage strategies in response to environmental variability.

AB To evaluate the role of natural enemies for the coexistence of competing species, it is necessary to estimate quantitatively the way in which the selectivity of the natural enemies changes the strength of competition between the competitors. This paper presents one method for doing this in host-parasitoid systems with discrete generations. The method is illustrated by analyzing the interaction between variegated leafhoppers (Erythroneura variabilis) and grape leafhoppers (E. elegantula) feeding on domestic grapes. The analysis confirms earlier observations that the recent replacement of grape leafhoppers with variegated leafhoppers is likely to be a consequence of the shared egg parasitoid Anagrus epos. Finally, we argue that the method can provide-a tool to evaluate the potential of biological control measures involving alternative prey, e.g., in intercropping systems.

AB Models of behavior and life history evolution under predation risk often assume that animals can detect and respond to subtle temporal and spatial variation in mortality risk, but there is little evidence supporting this assumption. We measured phenotypic responses of Rana lessonae tadpoles to variation in apparent predation risk signaled by different numbers of Aeshna dragonfly larvae consuming different quantities of tadpoles. The experiment took place in 80-L artificial ponds, and the predators were confined within cages so that they could not capture the experimental animals. There was good support for continuous dosage response curves for most behavioral and morphological traits, which indicates sensitivity to graded risk and therefore supports the assumptions of many models. Behavioral traits were most responsive to the number of tadpoles killed by the predators, whereas morphological traits responded to the number of dragonflies independent of the predators' diet. The results imply that behavioral and morphological responses can be triggered by different cues, and suggest that increasing investment in defensive traits entails increasing fitness costs.

AB We used a behavioral bioassay, in the form of foraging behavior of Gerbillus allenbyi, and the ideal free distribution to estimate the costs associated with risk of predation. Experiments were conducted in two pairs of 2-ha field enclosures. Risk of predation was introduced to one I-ha subplot of each pair of enclosures either by simulating the light of a full moon or by causing trained owls to fly over our experimental subplot. We used a titration method to estimate the energetic costs associated with risk of predation. We added seeds to the 1-ha subplot of each enclosure that experienced the risk of predation. The adjacent subplot served as a control. Without seed addition the subplot without risk of predation had more foraging activity: the foragers were avoiding the risk of predation. As the amount of seeds in the treatment increased, the gerbils responded smoothly and quantitatively and shifted their foraging activity back to the subplot with the seeds (and risk). At addition rates of 4.24-8.47 seeds per individual per ha per night (simulated-moonlight treatment) and 4.24-5.64 g seeds per individual per ha per night (owl-flights treatment) the seed addition compensated for the extra risk. At these rates the foraging activity on the two subplots of each enclosure was the same. Our results suggested that, when challenged by the threat of predation, G. allenbyi individuals spent at least 25% of their foraging time being vigilant.

AB Two sister species of Chaoborus exist in Europe. They are found in two distinct habitats that differ strongly in habitat persistence time. Chaoborus flavicans is found primarily in lakes inhabited by fish, whereas Chaoborus crystallinus is found exclusively in small ponds without fish. Chaoborus flavicans has evolved an adaptive response to predatory fish. In the presence of fish chemicals it can migrate vertically in the water column and can thus avoid predation. Chaoborus flavicans can therefore coexist with fish. Chaoborus crystallinus avoids oviposition into water bodies that are inhabited by fish and hence lives only in small fish-free ponds. These differences lead to several testable hypotheses: (1) The extinction risk of local populations of C. crystallinus is higher than that for C. flavicans. (2) C. crystallinus has a higher dispersal probability than C. flavicans. (3) The spatial population structure of each species differ.
   The results from a 3-yr population survey verified the first hypothesis that the extinction risk for C. crystallinus is higher than for C. flavicans, Field and laboratory experiments confirmed the second hypothesis. The results showed that. although C. flavicans disperses faster. the probability that C. crystallinus individuals disperse farther than 1 km is almost an order of magnitude higher compared to C. flavicans. The comparison of the spatial population structure of the two species shows that Chaoborus live in two different population structures that are subject to different metapopulation processes. Chaoborus crystallinus exists in a Levins-metapopulation, while C. flavicans exhibits a mainland-island population structure, these findings confirmed the third hypothesis. These results show that two species of the same genus live in two very different metapopulation structures and therefore present an ideal system to test comparative hypotheses within metapopulation ecology.

AB Constraints on nitrogen fixation are the ultimate causes of N limitation of primary production, but hypotheses concerning limitations to N, fixation remain largely untested in natural terrestrial ecosystems. We examined limitations to N. fixation by thinleaf alder (Alnus tenuifolia) in two stages of primary forest succession on the Tanana River floodplain (interior Alaska, USA) and focused on the hypothesis that N. fixation was limited by low soil P availability. Paired control and P fertilized plots were established at four replicate early successional alder stands and four later successional poplar (Populus balsamifera) stands (dense alder understories with mature poplar overstories) and N-2 fixation was estimated with an acetylene reduction assay. In alder stands, P fertilization increased total nodule dry biomass and increased total ecosystem N inputs, but it had little effect on nitrogenase activity per unit nodule dry mass (specific acetylene reduction activity, ARA). Specific ARA increased only in late July when soil temperature and ARA were at their maximum values. In contrast, fertilization had no effect on these measures in poplar stands where reduced soil moisture may have superseded limitation by P. We detected no differences in specific ARA, total nodule biomass, or N inputs, between alder and poplar stands but all of these measures were highly variable. Leaf area of the alder canopy emerged as the best predictor of ecosystem inputs of fixed N among control plots. Alders resorbed high amounts of P but little N (consistent with low P availability and a high P demand and a high N availability in alder), and P fertilization reduced P resorption but had no effect on N resorption. The timing of N-2 fixation and N resorption indicate that late-season increases in leaf N, following a midseason reduction in leaf N, were driven by N-2 fixation in excess of plant N demands as nodules continued fixing N while alder leaves senesced. These results have shown that P limits N-2 fixation in alder stands in this nitrogen-limited sere, but that factors limiting N-2 fixation can change over short successional time scales.

AB The distribution of desert mistletoes (Phoradendron californicum) among mesquite (Prosopis velutina) hosts is significantly aggregated. We hypothesized that the aggregation of mistletoes among hosts is produced by the pattern of seed rain generated by seed dispersers. We tested whether frugivorous Phainopeplas (Phainopepla nitens) foraged preferentially, and hence deposited mistletoe seeds disproportionately, in already parasitized mesquites. We found that Phainopeplas favored parasitized tall trees as perching and feeding sites and deposited mistletoe seeds disproportionately on trees with these characteristics. To assess experimentally the effect of the presence of mistletoes on seed deposition, we removed mistletoes from host trees. Before mistletoe removal, seed deposition was equivalent and temporally correlated in pairs of control and removal trees. After removal, deposition was lower into removal trees than into unmanipulated trees. Although mistletoe removal resulted in lower seed deposition, it did not eliminate it. We inferred that seed deposition into parasitized hosts can result from deposition of seeds originating. from within a host and from other infected hosts. We, conclude that the response of seed-dispersing birds to mistletoes leads to disproportionate seed deposition into already parasitized trees and that the heterogeneous distribution of seeds among hosts created by birds contributes to the clumped distribution of mistletoes among hosts.

AB Neither linear nor two-dimensional frameworks may be the most appropriate for fish and other species constrained to disperse within river-creek systems. In particular, the hierarchical, dendritic structures of riverine networks are not well captured by existing spatial models. Here I use a simple. geometric model and metapopulation modeling to make three points concerning the ecological consequences of dendritic landscapes. First, connectivity patterns of-river-creek networks differ from linear landscapes, and these differences in connectivity can either enhance or reduce metapopulation persistence compared to linear systems, depending on the details of dispersal. Second, habitat fragmentation in dendritic landscapes has different (and arguably, more severe) consequences on fragment size than in either linear or two-dimensional systems, resulting in both smaller fragments and higher variance in fragment size. Third, dendritic landscapes can induce striking mismatches between the geometry of dispersal and the geometry of disturbance, and as is the case for arid-lands fishes, such mismatches can be important for population persistence.

AB Theoretical efforts and small-scale experiments have given rise to. the widespread belief that the fewer occurrences a species has or the more fragmented its distribution is, the more vulnerable that species should be to extinction. Lacking, however, are large-scale multi-species studies exploring, the connection between rarity and local extinction risk. Here we present a landscape-level biogeographic test of this widely assumed linkage: Using a unique data set detailing the occurrence patterns of freshwater fishes of the Sonoran Desert (a gravely endangered fauna) we obtained for each of 25 species a measure of rarity that was independent of spatial scale. We found that,fragmentation was consistently associated with elevated extinction risk, whereas the number of occurrences exerted a significant effect only if fragmentation had not already been accounted for. Specifically, desert fish species with the most fragmented historic distributions. were nearly five times more likely to suffer local extirpations (since 1980) than were species with more continuous distributions. These findings underscore what a strong link exists between spatial distribution and vulnerability to extinction, clarifying that the link exists even at the landscape level and across an entire biogeographic fauna.

AB Plant populations have long been noted to migrate faster than predicted based on their life history and seed dispersal characteristics (i.e., Reid's paradox of rapid plant migration). Although precise mechanisms to account for such phenomena are not fully known for all plant species, a combination of theoretical and empirically driven mechanisms often resolves this paradox. Here, we couple a series of direct and indirect field and laboratory exercises on one marine macrophyte, Zostera marina L. (eelgrass), to measured distances between new patches and established beds in order to elucidate the long-distance dispersal and colonization potential of this marine seagrass.
   Detached, floating reproductive shoots with mature seeds were found to remain positively buoyant for up to 2 wk and retain mature seeds for up to 3 wk before release under laboratory conditions. Analysis of the, detritus wrack along a remote shoreline found reproductive fragments with viable seeds up to 34 km from established, natural beds. Analysis of different regions of the Chesapeake Bay and coastal bays of the Delmarva Peninsula that once supported eelgrass populations, revealed natural patches at 13 sites ranging from 1 to 108 km from established populations. A combination of tidal currents and wind influences has the potential to move a passive particle at the surface (e.g., a floating reproductive fragment) up to 23 km in a 6-h tidal window suggesting that most unvegetated areas in this region that can support eelgrass are within the colonization potential envelope.
   We suggest that, when combined with earlier work on seed dispersal ecology of this species, eelgrass has strong qualities for high colonization potential of new habitat. The finding of natural patches at such great distances from established beds when studied in the context of the dispersal mechanism (currents and wind) make the dispersal distances of this species one of the highest for angiosperms, comparable in scale to mangroves and coconuts. This new understanding of the dispersal dynamics of eelgrass is critical in the context of seagrass restoration in areas distant from established beds, maintenance of existing populations threatened by anthropogenic inputs of sediments arid nutrients, and examining metapopulation concepts in seagrass ecology.

AB It is well established that plants provide alternative foods to predators of herbivorous arthropods. This provision may facilitate protection against herbivory. However, plants often cannot prevent other organisms from utilizing these foods as well. There. are many examples of herbivorous arthropods that can feed on plant-provided foods such as extrafloral nectar and pollen. The question therefore arises whether individual plants still gain protection when not only the predators, but also the herbivores, can feed on these foods. We investigated this question using a mathematical model and experiments that assessed the impact of supplementary pollen on the dynamics of predatory mites (Iphiseius degenerans (Berlese)) and herbivorous thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande)), two arthropods capable of using pollen for reproduction. Replicated greenhouse experiments showed that addition of pollen every two weeks to one young mature leaf of a male-sterile cucumber-plant increased predator population growth and greatly reduced herbivore numbers.
   A stage-structured predator-prey-pollen model with experimentally established parameter gave reasonably accurate predictions of population trends observed in the greenhouse experiments with and without pollen. Model analysis yielded three important results. First, herbivore (prey) equilibria always settled to lower values in the presence of pollen. Second, mean herbivore numbers during the transient phase following predator release were not always lower under pollen supply, depending on the initial numbers of predators and prey. Third, limiting the plant area covered with pollen led to a decrease in mean herbivore numbers; provided that the predators aggregated in (and thereby "monopolized") pollen patches. The latter result may explain why plants provide alternative foods at specific sites.

AB A food web customarily describes the qualitative feeding relationships in a community. Descriptors have been used to extract ecologically meaningful information from such data. e.g., the proportion of top species (the proportion of taxa without consumers) or vulnerability (the average number of consumers per taxon). Analyses of collections of food webs based on these properties have revealed regularities that fostered the formulation of models of food-web structure. However, it has been shown that most of these qualitative descriptors are highly sensitive to the varying levels of sampling effort used to document a food web. The principal problem is that webs described extensively include trophic links of highly uneven magnitude, with typically few strong/important links and a wealth of weak ones; with qualitative descriptors, the same weight is given to all trophic interactions. To overcome this problem, food webs should be described and analyzed quantitatively. Consequently, we propose here a suite of food-web descriptors, which are built on information-theory indices and take the magnitude of the trophic interactions into account. We define descriptors having a similar meaning as the classical qualitative indices. Two versions of each quantitative descriptor are proposed, one giving the same weight to each taxon, and one weighting each taxon by the total amount of its incoming and outgoing biomass flows. We use a published quantitative food web to exemplify the computation of the new descriptors, and discuss their potential and limitations.

AB Sexual selection often affects individuals of the two sexes differently by imposing severe survival costs on individuals of the chosen sex, usually males. These costs may be energetic, physiological, mechanical, or ecological, and they can give rise to sex differences in survival. We studied survival rates of male and female adult Barn Swallows Hirundo rustica in a Danish population during 1984-1998, for the first time using capture mark-recapture techniques to estimate the consequences of sexual selection for sex differences in survival. Males had slightly, but not significantly, higher survival than females. Females had annual survival estimates that were significantly more variable than those for males. Male annual survival rates were not positively correlated with those of females. Hence, different factors were hypothesized to affect male and. female Survival rate. Consistent with this prediction we found that annual male survival decreased with increasing, annual mean length of the outermost tail feathers, which is a secondary sexual character subject to intense directional sexual selection. Heavier females were more likely to survive. Furthermore, females with long tails survived better than short-tailed females. Since tail length in females is an indicator of female condition, both body mass and tail length relationships suggest that females survive better in years when they are in superior condition. Thus, sexual selection as reflected by differences in tail length of males and females contributes in different ways to survival of male and female Barn Swallows.

AB Herbivore performance and reproductive output are expected to covary with qualitative changes in the host plant. The availability of nutrients may be especially important for the quality of algae as food through its effect on both primary and secondary metabolism and within-plant variation. We evaluated the effect of the nutrient enrichment of the brown alga Fucus vesiculosits on the fecundity, mass gain, intermolt duration, and food consumption of females of the herbivorous isopod Idotea baltica. We reared the isopods on algae grown either under enhanced nutrient conditions or as controls for the entire duration of the intermolt preceding mating and oviposition. The herbivores fed on nutrient-treated algae achieved higher growth rates, consumed more food, and laid more and larger eggs than the controls. The nutrient treatment increased the amount of insoluble sugars and reduced both the total carbon content in the alga and the physical toughness of the thallus. On the other hand, the treatment had no effect on the amount of total nitrogen or phlorotannins in the algal tissue. This implies that the clear increase in herbivore performance and fecundity may be due to quantitative changes in the carbohydrate metabolism rather than to the lower content of feeding deterrents in the tissue of F. vesiculosits, We suggest that eutrophication may potentially improve the quality of F. vesiculosus for herbivores. The reproductive success, a growth, and food consumption of L baltica increase on algae maintained in a nutrient-rich environment;, this is likely, to be reflected in herbivore density and grazing pressure. This in turn may have potential ecological consequences for the maintenance of viable F. vesiculosits belts, thereby contributing to the structure of littoral algal assemblages in marine ecosystems.

AB Numerous experimental studies providing extra food have concluded that food availability at the beginning of the breeding season constrains the start of egg-laying for female birds (Food Supply Hypothesis) because supplemented females usually lay earlier than nonsupplemented ones. This conclusion has recently been questioned because food addition studies may be confounded by ordered habitat selection. Ordered habitat selection occurs when territories or nests provided with extra food are chosen by individuals of higher quality that may be able to initiate breeding early, regardless of food supply (Habitat Selection Hypothesis). To test these two hypotheses, we performed an experiment using the Lesser Kestrel (Falco naumanni). To reveal effects of ordered habitat selection, extra food was provided to half of the nests in two colonies in which the other nests remained unsupplemented (mixed colonies). We provided extra food to all nests in two colonies (all-fed colonies) and to no nests in three colonies (all-unfed colonies). In these colonies, ordered habitat selection could not occur because all nests received equal treatment. In mixed colonies, fed pairs laid earlier than unfed ones. In contrast to the prediction of the Habitat Selection Hypothesis, there was no significant difference in mean laying date between unfed pairs of mixed colonies and pairs in all-unfed colonies, or between fed pairs of mixed colonies and pairs in all-fed colonies. Moreover, laying date was significantly earlier in all-fed than in all-unfed colonies. Therefore, the results support the Food Supply Hypothesis and refute the Habitat Selection Hypothesis.

AB The depth of the well-mixed surface layer of lakes and oceans fundamentally affects phytoplankton populations. Specific nutrient supply, specific algal production, and specific sinking losses all decrease with increasing mixing depth. I use a dynamical model to investigate how phytoplankton biomass, light availability, and the distribution Of nutrients among various pools vary along a mixing depth gradient, and how the relationships of these variables to mixing depth depend on algal sinking velocity, abiotic light absorbents, nutrient enrichment, and the mode of nutrient supply (closed system with recycling vs. open system with external input). If phytoplankton is dominated by sinking algae, the primary causes of biomass limitation shift with increasing mixing depth from sinking loss limitation to nutrient limitation to light limitation. Consequently, algal biomass in the mixed layer (expressed per volume or area) and sedimented nutrients are unimodally related to mixing depth, whereas dissolved inorganic and total water column nutrients show the inverse pattern. Compared to closed systems, the maximum in the biomass concentration-mixing depth relationship occurs at much shallower depths in open systems without recycling of sedimented nutrients (such as mixed surface layers on top of stratified water columns). With increased algal sinking velocity, algal biomass decreases, and light penetration and dissolved nutrients both increase, whereas sedimented and total water column nutrients may increase or decrease. Increased abiotic turbidity reduces light penetration, algal biomass, and sedimented nutrients but increases dissolved and total water column nutrients. Finally, with nutrient enrichment, algal biomass and all nutrient compartments increase, whereas light penetration decreases. I use a graphical isocline approach to show that increasing external light supply, decreasing abiotic turbidity, and decreasing mixing depth represent three conceptually different forms of enrichment with light. Of those, decreasing abiotic turbidity is conceptually similar to enrichment with a mineral nutrient.

AB Positive density dependence (the Allee effect) has numerous implications for the dynamics. distribution, and conservation of populations, but has been considered difficult to measure because it should occur only at small population sizes. Theories of density-dependent habitat selection provide a simple solution. Allee effects produce erratic habitat selection where individuals that initially pack into the better habitat flow rapidly into the poorer one at a threshold density. The instability creates a hiatus or "hole" in abundance along habitat isodars (graphs of density assuming ideal habitat selection). The presence of an Allee effect can be detected easily by calculating the exact probabilities of the observed frequency of data points in the hiatus area with that expected if fitness is positively density dependent at low density. Tests of the theory using rodents occupying mesic and xeric habitats in Canada's Rocky Mountains reveal a clear example of the Allee effect in red-backed voles, and hint at a similar effect in deer mice. The tests suggest that Populations of small mammals may frequently reach low densities where positive density dependence in fitness may play a significant role in population persistence.

AB Demographic matrix models are standard tools for analyzing the dynamics of age- or stage-structured populations. Here, we present a method for estimating the average vital rates that parameterize a demographic matrix using a series of measurements of population size and structure (an, "inverse problem" of demographic analysis). We join a deterministic, density-indepenent demographic matrix model with a stochastic observation model to write a likelihood function for the matrix parameters given the data. Adopting a Bayesian perspective, we combine this likelihood function with prior distributions for the model parameters to produce a joint posterior distribution for the parameters. We use a numerical technique (Markov chain Monte Carlo) to estimate and analyze the posterior distribution, and from this we calculate posterior distributions for functions of the demographic matrix, such as the population multiplication rate, stable stage distribution, and matrix sensitivities. Although measurements of population size and structure rarely contain enough information to estimate all the parameters in a matrix precisely, our analysis sheds light on the information that the data do contain about the vital rates by quantifying the precision of the parameter estimates and the correlations among them. Moreover, we show that matrix functions such as the population multiplication rate and matrix sensitivities can still be estimated precisely despite sizable uncertainty in the estimates of individual parameters, permitting biologically meaningful inference. We illustrate our approach for three populations of pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum).

AB Some shade-intolerant trees with soil seed banks also have advanced recruits under a closed canopy. To determine the relative roles of advanced recruits and seed banks in regeneration, we studied the demography of seedling cohorts of the deciduous canopy tree, Swida controversa, in an old-growth temperate forest in Japan. Five cohorts that germinated in 1988-1992 were followed for 10 yr, relating their survival. and growth to the environment. We measured distance to the nearest conspecific adult, initial local density of conspecific seedlings, herbaceous plant coverage,, light intensity, and soil water content. Seed production occurred only in 1988 and 1990, but seedlings emerged every year from 1988 to 1992. Only increasing distance to the nearest conspecific adult had a significant, positive effect on seedling survival. Damping-off by fungal pathogens was the most common cause of seedling mortality, especially near conspecific adults. Growth of seedlings was significantly and positively affected by light level; rapid growth occurred mostly in a large gap (similar to200 m(2)). Even here, however, the growth rate of seedlings decreased over time. A stochastic simulation suggested that the relative importance of soil seeds and advanced recruits changes with the distance. In sites < 25 m from conspecific adults, colonization of gaps should occur via the soil seed bank, because seedlings do not survive at these distances. In sites farther away, advanced recruits were more important than the seed bank in colonizing gaps. We hypothesize that, in sites with an abundant population of S. controversa, regeneration would most likely originate from the soil seed bank, but in other sites regeneration would most likely be from advanced recruits.

AB Biodiversity includes both taxonomic and functional aspects, each of which can play significant roles in ecosystem functioning. The number of functional groups, specifically intratrophic group (e.g., plant or herbivore) functional richness (F), serves as a simple index of ecological diversity, while species richness (S) serves as a simple index of taxonomic diversity. F and S are, however, roughly correlated measures of biodiversity, and disentangling the relative influence of one over the other on ecosystem functioning (H) requires a multivariate index. Appropriate multivariate biodiversity indices can be derived by applying principal component analyses to the set of possible combinations of S and F in an experimental design. The first principal component (PCAI) represents covariation between F and S, while the second principal component (PCAII) provides information on functioning that is associated with the independent effects of F and S. Thus, one can replace the conventional model H = f(F, S) with H = f(PCAI, PCAII). This approach obviates a number of statistical problems encountered when following the traditional approach. Furthermore, if the question being addressed concerns the relationship be tween biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and not the relative contributions of F and S, PCAI may be used to develop more tractable, yet effective experimental designs than the conventional, exhaustive F X S experimental studies currently in favor. I explore the theoretical foundation for this multivariate approach and provide an example using the results from experimental prairie grassland plant assemblages at Cedar Creek Natural History Area, Minnesota, USA. This study highlights the need to adapt traditional, taxonomic approaches to biodiversity research to include functional diversity.

AB Despite recent high impacts of disease in the ocean, quantitative studies of diseases in natural marine populations lag far behind terrestrial systems. Transmission processes are poorly known in relatively open marine systems. We studied infection of sea fans Gorgonia ventalina by the fungus Aspergillus sydowii. To assess detectability and mechanisms of secondary transmission of the fungus, we analyzed the spatial distribution of disease among the fans, using Ripley's K as a measure of disease aggregation. Coral populations and disease were mapped at three reefs in the Florida Keys. Where disease prevalence was low, the disease was distributed randomly among sea fans. This is consistent with disease transmission by input of infectious fungal material from terrestrial sources only. However, where disease prevalence was high, the disease was significantly. aggregated among sea fans at the 2-8 in scale, consistent with secondary disease transmission. Such transmission could take place by physical contact between neighboring fans, or infected fans might shed fungal material into the water column, and other fans become infected by these fomites. Our results suggest that water-borne transmission occurs, but secondary transmission by physical contact is also likely. We cannot falsify the hypothesis that small-scale local environmental conditions also contribute to disease aggregation.

AB Determination of the relative abundance of two populations, separated by time or space, is of interest in many ecological situations. We focus on two estimators of relative abundance, which assume that the probability that an individual is detected at least once in the survey is either equal or unequal for the two populations. We present three methods for incorporating the collected information into our inference. The first method, proposed previously, is a traditional hypothesis test for evidence that detection probabilities are unequal. However, we feel that, a priori, it is more likely that detection probabilities are actually different; hence, the burden of proof should be shifted, requiring evidence that detection probabilities are practically equivalent. The second method we present, equivalence testing, is one approach to doing so. Third, we suggest that model averaging could be used by combining the two estimators according to derived model weights. These differing approaches are applied to a mark-recapture experiment on Nuttall's cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus nuttallii) conducted in central Oregon during 1974 and 1975, which has been previously analyzed by other authors.

AB Vegetation recovery from fire has been widely studied at the stand level in many types of terrestrial ecosystems, but factors controlling regeneration at the landscape scale are less well known. Over large areas, fire history, climate, topography, and dominant type of vegetation may affect postfire response. Increased fire frequency, as is occurring in some mediterranean-type ecosystems, may reduce ecosystem resilience, i.e., the ability to recover the pre-disturbance state. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Landsat imagery to monitor vegetation recovery after Successive fires in a 32 100-km(2) area of Catalonia (northeastern Spain) between 1975 and 1993. In areas burned twice, NDVI patterns indicated that regrowth after 70 mo was lower after the second fire than after the first. This trend was observed several years after burning, but not immediately following fire. Green biomass after the second fire significantly increased with longer intervals of time between fires. There was also a positive correlation between postfire NDVI and mean rainfall, whereas a negative correlation was found between NDVI and solar radiation. Forests dominated by resprouting Quercus spp. were more resilient to fire, but they showed a larger decrease in resilience after the second fire than did forests dominated by Pinus spp. that regenerate from seed. We conclude that the use of time series satellite images may help to gain further insights in postfire vegetation dynamics over large regions and long time periods.

AB We propose a multivariate approach to the study of geographic species distribution which does not require absence data. Building on Hutchinson's concept of the ecological niche, this factor analysis compares, in the multidimensional space of ecological variables, the distribution of the localities where the focal species was observed to a reference set describing the whole study area. The first factor extracted maximizes the marginality of the focal species, defined as the ecological distance between the species optimum and the mean habitat within the reference area. The other factors maximize the specialization of this focal species, defined as the ratio of the ecological variance in mean habitat to that observed for the focal species. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are readily interpreted and can be used to build habitat-suitability maps. This approach is recommended in Situations where absence data are not available (many data banks), unreliable (most cryptic or rare species), or meaningless (invaders). We provide an illustration and validation of the method for the alpine ibex, a species reintroduced in Switzerland which presumably has not yet recolonized its entire range.

AB In this paper I examine the effects that the competitive environment in which plants are grown and the timing of herbivore damage have on the expression and pattern of selection acting on plant tolerance to herbivory and resistance to herbivores. I conducted a field experiment involving 720 plants from 24 full-sib families of the common morning glory, Ipomoea purpurea. Plants were grown in one of two competitive environments, and the levels of resistance and tolerance to naturally occurring folivory expressed by the 24 families were estimated three times during the growing season: soon after plants emerged, when plants began to flower, and when seed capsules began to mature. Low- and high-competition environments were established using different densities of interspecific competitors. Herbivory had a negative effect on plant fitness in both competitive environments, and consistent with the compensatory continuum hypothesis, herbivory was more detrimental in the high- than low-competition environments. Phenotypic analyses also revealed that early- and late-season damage were more detrimental than mid-season herbivore damage. Although fitness was more negatively affected by herbivore damage in the high- than low-competition environments, competition did not affect the pattern of selection acting on defense traits. Similarly, the patterns of selection acting on either resistance or tolerance to early-, mid-, and late-season herbivory did not differ significantly. Therefore, there was little evidence that environmental or seasonal differences in the pattern of selection acting on defense traits will constrain their evolution.

AB Multivariate regression trees (MRT) are a new statistical technique that can be used to explore, describe, and predict relationships between multispecies data and environmental characteristics. MRT forms clusters of sites by repeated splitting of the data, with each split defined by a simple rule based on environmental values. The splits are chosen to minimize the dissimilarity of sites within clusters. The measure of species dissimilarity can be selected by the user, and hence MRT can be used to relate any aspect of species composition to environmental data. The clusters and their dependence on the environmental data are represented graphically by a tree. Each cluster also represents a species assemblage, and its environmental values define its associated habitat. MRT can be used to analyze complex ecological data that may include imbalance, missing values, nonlinear relationships between variables, and high-order interactions. They can also predict species composition at sites for which only environmental data are available. MRT is compared with redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis using simulated data and a field data set.

AB Dispersal has profound effects on parasite populations. Understanding the dispersal behavior of parasites is fundamental to our appreciation of their virulence, epidemiology, and host specificity. Very few host-parasite systems, however, allow for studying how parasites optimize their transmission rates. Here, we investigated the dispersal behavior of a common ectoparasite of European passerine birds, the flea Ceratophyllus gallinae. This flea primarily infests hole-nesting species and breeds during its host's breeding season. Once the host leaves the nest, flea larvae build cocoons, pupate, and remain dormant before initiating their host search. There is considerable variation in the time at which they hatch and disperse from the nest boxes. Some offspring disperse before the hosts choose their nest sites at the beginning of the next breeding period, while others wait until after that stage to disperse. By experimentally manipulating the density of fleas in the nests of their breeding hosts we were able to investigate density-dependent processes that would later affect the dispersal behavior of flea offspring. We found that the density of offspring in the nests was negatively correlated with the proportion of early-dispersing individuals and negatively affected the phenotypic quality of dispersers. Flea offspring of poor phenotypic quality in terms of body size dispersed earlier and had lower potential fecundity than bigger individuals. In a laboratory experiment, we found that the intensity of larval competition strongly affected offspring development, body size at maturity, and overwintering capacity. Thus, in order to maximize their chance of transmission, C. gallinae individuals adjust their dispersal behavior according to their phenotypic quality. In this species, dispersal in time may be explained by the carryover effects of variation in the amount of competition experienced at the larval stage.

AB Ecological common sense says that decreased solar energy should reduce herbivore production because of reduced energy flow through primary producers. However, a field experiment in a phosphorus-limited lake showed that production of zooplankton herbivores was increased by shading. This paradoxical outcome was caused by a decoupling of producer carbon fixation and nutrient uptake under high light that reduced food quality for herbivores. At low nutrient supplies, shading increased nutrient contents relative to carbon within algal food, outweighing effects of decreased primary production. Thus, light/ nutrient balance affects the degree of mismatch between primary producers and herbivores in nature, which in turn influences mass-transfer efficiencies along food chains. To predict how energy transfer efficiency and biological interactions will respond to perturbations, it is essential to take into account changes in light/nutrient balance and its effects on the stoichiometry of autotroph-herbivore interactions.

AB Our understanding of fine-root decay processes is derived almost exclusively from litterbag studies. However, preparation of roots for litterbag studies and their subsequent decay within litterbags represent major departures, from in situ conditions. We hypothesized that litterbag studies misrepresent fine-root decay and nutrient release rates during decomposition. To test these hypotheses, we developed a new intact-core technique that requires no, a priori root processing, retains natural rhizosphere associations, and maintains in situ decay conditions. Using both litterbags and intact cores, we measured annual decay rates and nitrogen release from newly senesced fine roots of silver maple, maize, and winter wheat. After one year, mass loss was 10-23% greater, and nitrogen release was 21-29% higher within intact cores. Differences appeared to result from litterbag-induced alterations to decomposer dynamics and from. unavoidable changes to fine-root size-class composition within litterbags. Our results suggest that fine-root decay and nutrient turnover occur significantly faster than estimated from litterbag studies. By minimizing disturbances to roots, soil, and rhizosphere associates prior to root decay, the, intact-core technique provides an improved alternative for measuring fine-root decomposition.

AB persistent, difficult questions including: how large and variable were these populations before European settlement? Here, we examine the feasibility of reconstructing salmon abundance using links between marine nutrients carried upstream by Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and growth of dominant riparian trees in two Alaskan systems. We employ standard dendrochronology methods and regression models to quantify relationships between annual tree-ring growth, salmon escapement, and the climate pattern that affects oceanic production of Northeast Pacific salmon stocks, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). We find that known, annual salmon escapement is significantly related to tree-ring growth at two sites in the Pacific coastal rainforest (PCRF) (r(2) = 0.23, P < 0.05 at each site), but not at two sites in the boreal forest. We then use relationships established at PCRF sites to reconstruct preliminary salmon spawning abundances to 1820 A.D. The PDO was not correlated with local 19-yr salmon escapement records and could not be used in reconstructions. Reconstructions compare favorably to southeastern Alaska fisheries catch data from 1924 to 1994 (Pearson correlation = 0.301 [P = 0.02] and 0.401 [P < 0.01]). This study demonstrates the promise and utility of dendrochronology for reconstructing salmon returns to streams.

AB Natal dispersal behavior can vary considerably among individuals, but the causes intraspecific plasticity in dispersal are poorly understood. We tested six hypotheses about social and environmental conditions that might influence natal dispersal of males in the cooperatively breeding Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis). Further, we examined whether variation in dispersal behavior is heritable. Dispersing from the natal territory during the first year rather than remaining as a helper was associated with four factors. First, dispersing male fledglings were, on average, significantly lower in body mass than their philopatric siblings, indicating an influence of social dominance on dispersal. Second, individuals were more likely to disperse from territories with many male fledglings, independent of the number of adult male helpers per territory, suggesting that sibling (rather than helper-offspring) competition for future reproduction may be the underlying mechanism. Third, the probability of remaining as a helper rather than dispersing was positively associated with quality of the natal territory and with the number of high-quality territories close to the natal site. This suggests an influence of the benefits of philopatry, because many males that initially remain as helpers eventually become breeders on the natal territory or a neighboring territory. Finally, we found evidence that ecological constraints influence dispersal: the probability of dispersing was positively related to the availability of vacant territories in the wider neighborhood of the natal site. Natal dispersal behavior was not influenced by resource competition, measured as group size on the natal territory, or by local density, estimated as the number of active territories in the vicinity of the natal site. Based on comparisons of father-son and brother-brother dispersal behavior, we found no evidence for heritability of philopatric behavior. Dispersal of male fledgling Red-cockaded Woodpeckers can be viewed as conditional on social and ecological factors in the natal territory and in the immediate neighborhood. These factors seem to serve as proximate cues that influence young birds to either disperse or remain as philopatric helpers.

AB Dissolved organic carbon, DOC, is an important source of carbon for stream heterotrophs. In many systems, bacteria and fungi are carbon limited. Thus, carbon availability may control both the availability and the dynamics of other nutrients (N or P) in heterotrophic systems. To test the interdependence of C and N cycles in forested streams, we continuously added DOC, as potassium acetate, to the stream draining Watershed six at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, for six weeks during summer 1999. For two months prior to and throughout the addition, we monitored Streamwater NO3- and NH4+ concentrations throughout the 70-m upstream reference and the 70-m downstream treatment reaches. We also estimated uptake lengths and uptake rates of NO3- and NH4+ using back-to-back, short-term enrichments in both the treatment and reference reaches. The change in NO3- concentration during the NH4+ addition was used to estimate whole-stream nitrification. Once before the DOC addition and once during the DOC addition we measured denitrification rates and whole-stream respiration in both reaches. In the treatment reach;, the increase in labile DOC caused nitrate concentrations to decrease from pretreatment concentrations during the DOC addition. Metabolism was higher in the treatment than in the reference reach during that addition, while metabolism had been similar in the two reaches before the DOC addition. Prior to that addition, uptake lengths for both NO3- and NH4+ were longer in the treatment reach than in the reference reach. During the DOC addition, the uptake lengths for both forms of nitrogen were much shorter in the treatment than in the reference reach. Contrary to expectations, the DOC enrichment did not lead to increased rates of denitrification. The principal effect of DOC enrichment was to stimulate bacterial growth, leading to high respiration and a corresponding increase in the assimilative demand for nitrogen. Results from this experiment demonstrate tight linkages between DOC and nitrogen availability in headwater streams.

AB Optimal control theory is finding increased application in both theoretical and applied ecology, and it is a central element of adaptive resource management. One of the steps in an adaptive management process is to develop alternative models of system dynamics, models that are all reasonable in light of available data, but that differ substantially in their implications for optimal control of the resource. We explored how the form of the recruitment and survival functions in a general population model for ducks affected the patterns in the optimal harvest strategy, using a combination of analytical, numerical, and simulation techniques. We compared three relationships between recruitment and population density (linear, exponential, and hyperbolic) and three relationships between survival during the nonharvest season and population density (constant, logistic, and one related to the compensatory harvest mortality hypothesis). We found that the form of the component functions had a dramatic influence on the optimal harvest strategy and the ultimate equilibrium state of the system. For instance, while it is commonly assumed that a compensatory hypothesis leads to higher optimal harvest rates than an additive hypothesis, we found this to depend on the form of the recruitment function, in part because of differences in the optimal steady-state population density. This work has strong direct consequences for those developing alternative models to describe harvested systems, but it is relevant to a larger class of problems applying optimal control at the population level. Often, different functional forms will not be statistically distinguishable in the range of the data. Nevertheless, differences between the functions outside the range of the data can have an important impact on the optimal harvest strategy. Thus, development of alternative models by identifying a single functional form, then choosing different parameter combinations from extremes on the likelihood profile may end up producing alternatives that do not differ as importantly as if different functional forms had been used. We recommend that biological knowledge be used to bracket a range of possible functional forms, and robustness of conclusions be checked over this range.

AB The effects of top-down and bottom-up forces on species abundance and diversity were quantified in the inquiline communities found in the water-filled leaves of the pitcher plant. Sarracenia purpurea. A press field experiment was conducted in which the abundances of resources (dead ants) and the top predators (larva of the mosquito Wyeomiia smithii) were each maintained at three levels in a factorial design for 23 d. Abundances of mites, rotifers, protozoans, and bacteria increased significantly with prey addition. Protozoan species richness also increased with increasing resource levels, whereas additional resources did not affect bacterial species richness. Increases in top-predator density decreased rotifer abundance but increased bacterial abundance and species richness. Increases in bacterial abundance and richness indicate that a trophic cascade occurs via the larvae, rotifer, and bacteria pathway; omnivory appears to be not strong enough to affect the trophic cascade. Top-down and bottom-up forces both had strong, but different, effects on the abundance and richness of intermediate trophic levels. For most components of the inquiline community, species richness and population sizes are resource limited, whereas predator limitation targets a limited set of groups.

AB A continuous stochastic population model in space and time is presented. The model includes migration and spatially correlated environmental noise, and it accounts for spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality using a general spatial autocorrelation in the local carrying capacities. The model is analyzed by Fourier methods based on linearizations which are realistic when the population fluctuations are not too large. An expression for the spatial autocorrelation for the population density is derived together with some relatively simple relations for the scaling of these autocorrelations under the assumption that the migration rate is constant. For strong local density regulation, the spatial density pattern is approximately the same as the pattern of spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality. For weak density regulation the scaling increases with migration rate and distance and is approximately the same as the scaling of the environmental noise if the migration rate and distance are large. A required distinction between the spatial autocorrelation function and the function describing the spatial variation in the synchrony of population fluctuations is made. The effects of migration distance, migration rate, heterogeneity in carrying capacities, strength of local density regulation, and the magnitude and spatial autocorrelation in the environmental noise are discussed. Numerical examples illustrating the general findings are presented.

AB One important question in ecology is how large-scale regional phenomena affect the demography and dynamics of local populations. The purpose of the present study was to examine how climate affected spatial and temporal variation in demography within an insular metapopulation of House Sparrows (Passer domesticus). Daily weather conditions during the breeding season were highly correlated within the study region, and because the onset of breeding differed significantly among the five study islands, fledgling success was also affected. Thus, local recruitment was reduced by the occurrence of bad weather during the nestling period, and the asynchronous breeding phenology among the islands led to a significant island X year interaction in recruitment rate. Interaction between climate and the local environment provides a mechanism by which spatial synchrony in population dynamics can be reduced even in strongly spatially autocorrelated environments.

AB One major goal of conservation biology in fragmented landscapes is to identify the attributes of habitat networks that influence metapopulation persistence; and thereby to determine whether particular areas hold the key to regional persistence. In Britain, the genus Aricia is represented by A. agestis in the south and A. artaxerxes in the north. We mapped the distributions of A. agestis and A. artaxerxes at their range margins, where both species are restricted to isolated fragments of calcareous grassland containing the larval host plant Helianthemum chamaecistus. We present evidence that Aricia is likely to persist as metapopulations at its range margins. First, both individual habitat patches and semi-independent networks of patches showed colonizations and extinctions of Aricia. Second, the smallest and most isolated habitat patches were least likely to be occupied. Third, persistence was more closely related to the total area and configuration of habitat in each network (consistent with a metapopulation interpretation) than to the area of the largest patch (predicted for mainland-island systems). In addition, the occupancy of entire networks depended on their isolation from other networks, well beyond the empirically measured dispersal range of the species. We suggest that species may persist as "metapopulations of, metapopulations" at coarse spatial scales. In some systems, all networks may be prone to extinction, but we suggest that regional persistence more often depends on the continued occupancy of extinction-resistant core areas ("core/marginal metapopulations"). Extinctions of small metapopulations and very long-distance colonizations may profoundly influence the distributions of species in fragmented landscapes, and set the dynamic margins of species ranges. As a result, identification and protection of extinction-resistant core areas should be priorities in conservation programs.

AB Predator kills rate (i.e., kills per predator per time) is routinely presupposed' to depend exclusively on prey density. However, per capita rates of killing may typically depend on the density of both prey and predator. Unfortunately, our perception of many ecological phenomena may be limited by the inappropriate assumption that kill. rates do not depend on predator density. One of many ways to represent the influence of predator density is ratio-dependent predation, where kill rate depends on the ratio of prey to predator rather than the actual numbers of prey and predator. Determining the role of ratio dependency in predation theory has been contentious. Assessments of the influence of predator density on kill rate have been primarily limited to theoretical considerations, indirect evidence, and simplified laboratory demonstrations. We directly observed the influence of both prey and predator density on kill rates in an unmanipulated terrestrial system of large mammals-wolves,(Canis lupus) and moose (Alces alces). Predator density explained more variation in kill rate than did prey density (R-2 = 0.36 vs. R-2 = 0.17, respectively). Moreover, the ratio-dependent model greatly outperformed the prey-dependent model. Nevertheless, the ratio-dependent model failed to explain most of the variation in kill rate (i.e., R-2 = 0.34). The ratio-dependent-prey-dependent controversy may dissipate with greater appreciation and acknowledgment that both models may be overly simplistic, both have value, and neither deserves primacy.

AB We describe and test a method for fitting noisy differential equation models to a time series of Population counts, motivated by stage-structured models of insect and zooplankton populations. We consider semimechanistic models, in which the model structure is derived from knowledge of the life cycle, but the rate equations are estimated nonparametrically from the time-series data. The method involves smoothing the population time series x(t) in order to estimate the gradient dx/dt, and then fitting rate equations using penalized regression splines. Computer-intensive methods are used to estimate and remove the biases that result from the data being discrete time samples with sampling errors from a continuous time process. Semimechanistic modeling makes it possible to test assumptions about the mechanisms behind population fluctuations without the results being confounded by possibly arbitrary choices of parametric forms for process-rate equations. To illustrate this application, we analyze time-series data on laboratory populations of blowflies Lucilia cuprina and Lucilia sericata. The models assume that the populations are limited by competition among adults affecting their current birth and death rates. The results cot-respond to the actual experimental conditions. For L. cuprina (where the model's structure is appropriate) a good fit can be obtained, while for L. sericata (where the model is inappropriate), the fitted model does not reproduce some major features of the observed cycles. A documented set of R functions for all steps in the model-fitting process is provided as a supplement to this article.

AB Nondetection of a species at a site does not imply that the species is absent unless the probability of detection is 1. We propose a model and likelihood-based method for estimating site occupancy rates when detection probabilities are < 1. The model provides a flexible framework enabling covariate information to be included and allowing for missing observations. Via computer simulation, we found that the model provides good estimates of the occupancy rates, generally unbiased for moderate detection probabilities (>0.3). We estimated site occupancy rates for two anuran species at 32 wetland sites in Maryland, USA, from data collected during 2000 as part of an amphibian monitoring, program, Frog-watch USA. Site occupancy rates were estimated as 0.49 for American toads (Bufo americanas), a 44% increase over the proportion of sites at which they were actually observed. and as 0.85 for spring, peepers (Pseudacris crucifier), slightly above the observed proportion of 0.83.

AB An experimental manipulation of germination timing was conducted to test whether germination timing influences the phenotypic expression of postgermination life-P history characteristics and whether it alters natural selection on those characters. Seeds collected from five natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana in Kentucky were forced to germinate in early November, early December, and early March. Life-history characters such as timing of reproduction. size at reproduction, and size at senescence were measured, and fruit production and mortality were monitored. Germination timing significantly altered subsequent life-history characters and reproduction. November germinants were larger than December germinants when they began reproducing, and they commenced reproduction sooner. All spring germinants died before reproducing. Germination timing also influenced natural selection on life-history characters. December germinants were more strongly selected to be large at the time of reproduction than November germinants, indicating stronger selection for a faster growth rate in December germinants. Stabilizing selection on timing of reproduction was detected in December germinants but not in November germinants. Therefore. variation in germination timing influenced fitness, modified the phenotypic expression of important life-history characters, and altered the strength and mode of natural selection on them.

Based on NOAA/AVHRR satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, we evaluated the effects of climate on annual and seasonal ANPP across regional gradients of precipitation (100-500 mm/yr) and temperature (-1degrees-9degreesC of annual mean). We studied ANPP climatic controls through time at four sites using NDVI and meteorological data.
   We used annual NDVI integral as a surrogate of annual ANPP. Annual NDVI integral increased linearly along regional gradients of precipitation, and its annual variability decreased exponentially. Annual NDVI integral was, in most cases, unrelated to precipitation through time. We described the seasonality, of ANPP using four variables derived from seasonal NDVI curves: the dates of growing season start and end, the date of maximum NDVI, and the length of the growing season. The growing season started later toward the cold extreme of the regional temperature gradients and, within a given site through time, during the coldest years. The dates of maximum NDVI and end of the growing season occurred later toward the humid or cold extremes of the regional gradients, whereas the length of the growing season was positively affected by precipitation and temperature along these gradients. These variables were not associated with climate through time. The response of the start of the growing season to temperature was greater in time, following the natural climatic fluctuations, than in space, accompanying regional temperature gradients. This difference probably resulted because the time required for shifts in community composition and plant adaptation is longer than one year. Climatic determinants of ANPP shifted from precipitation alone to precipitation plus temperature when the temporal scale of analysis changed from annual to seasonal. Our results indicate the feasibility of forecasting forage availability a few months prior to the beginning of the growing season, but not during the whole year. Longer term data sets and manipulative experiments are required to forecast annual ANPP and predict its response to climate change.

AB The relative impacts of intrinsic factors (e.g., density dependence) and extrinsic factors (e.g., climate) on winter demography may be critical for the generation of different population dynamic patterns (including cyclicity) in northern vole and lemming populations. However, little is known about winter demography because studies with temporal and spatial replication at the population level and an adequate sample of individuals with known fates, within each population are rare. In this study, we monitored the winter demography of 48 local tundra vole populations introduced to experimentally enclosed plots the preceding spring for four years in Norway.
   The rate of population change over the winter (November-May) was density dependent due to recruitment. However, the large variation in the rate of change between the different winters was due to a density-independent, and most likely a climatically driven, variation in survival rate. In particular, mild weather that led to the formation of ice on the ground. seemed to be detrimental for winter survival. We predict that if increased frequency of such events arose, due to climate change, normal cyclic dynamics of northern small rodent populations would be disrupted.
   We found support for the hypothesis that voles adjusted their body mass toward a certain mean during the winter so as to maximize winter survival. The survival rate of males was lower than that of females, possibly due to their larger body mass, and this resulted in female-biased-population sex ratios in the spring. This result suggests a link between sexual selection (responsible for the sexual size dimorphism) and natural selection (operating though size-dependent winter survival) with implications for the demographic structure of the population.

AB Estimation of avian nest survival has traditionally involved simple measures of apparent nest survival or Mayfield constant-nest-survival models. However, these methods do not allow researchers to build models that rigorously assess the importance of a wide range of biological factors that affect nest survival. Models that incorporate greater detail, such as temporal variation in nest survival and covariates representative of individual nests represent a substantial improvement over traditional estimation methods. In an attempt to improve nest survival estimation procedures, we introduce the nest survival model now available in the program MARK and demonstrate its use on a nesting study of Mountain Plovers (Charadrius montanus Townsend) in Montana, USA. We modeled the daily survival of Mountain Plover nests as a function of the sex of the incubating adult, nest age, year, linear and quadratic time trends, and two weather covariates (maximum daily temperature and daily precipitation) during a six-year study (1995-2000). We found no evidence for yearly differences or an effect of maximum daily temperature on the daily nest survival of Mountain Plovers. Survival rates of nests tended by female and male plovers differed (female rate = 0.33; male rate = 0.49). The estimate of the additive effect for males on nest survival rate was 0.37 (95% confidence limits were 0.03, 0.71) on a logit scale. Daily survival rates of-nests increased with nest age; the estimate of daily nest-age change in survival in the best model was 0.06 (95% confidence limits were 0.04, 0.09) on a logit scale. Daily precipitation decreased the probability that the nest would survive to the next day; the estimate of the additive effect of daily precipitation on the nest survival rate was -1.08 (95% confidence limits were -2.12, -0.13) on a logit scale. Our approach to modeling daily nest-survival rates allowed several biological factors of interest to be easily included in nest survival models and allowed us to generate more biologically meaningful estimates of nest survival.

AB Understanding biological invasions requires information on the history of spatial spread, as well as measures of landscape and biotic features that control habitat invasibility. Because invasive species often spread quickly over large areas, attaining these two sets of information simultaneously is uncommon. We studied the spread of a fatal normative root pathogen, Phytophthora lateralis, across a heterogeneous landscape of its host, Port Orford cedar (Chamaecyparis,lawsoniana). Within our 37-km(2) study area in southwestern Oregon and northwest California, Port Orford cedar populations are generally restricted to riparian zones along creeks. The pathogen is spread between watersheds in two ways: (1) by spore-infested material being dislodged from vehicles, and (2) by animals or people moving infested mud (i.e., via foot traffic). Using dendrochronological techniques, we determined the date of infection for dead cedars and reconstructed spread history across our study area from 1977 to 1999. Twenty-six of the 36 (72%) separate infection events we identified were caused by dispersal via vehicles along roads, and the remainder by foot traffic. Survival analysis demonstrated that cedar populations in creeks crossed by roads were more likely to be infected than those creeks that were not. crossed by roads. Also, a comparison of minimum dispersal distances showed infections that moved via road moved significantly farther than those vectored by foot traffic, and the distance infection traveled declined significantly through time. We also coupled our spread history with measures of landscape and host features, including abundance of potential host trees, the distance from the road surface to the nearest potential host, length of road in immediate contact with the riparian zone, catchment area (a measure of stream flow), elevation, slope, and solar radiation. Our results show that catchment area, host abundance, and proximity to the nearest tree are significantly and positively associated with infection risk. Our study demonstrates that increased connectivity between invasible sites created by the presence of roads can increase invasion success of a plant pathogen. We also document that successful pathogen invasion can be governed by both physical landscape features and attributes of host plant populations.

AB We inventoried two Amazonian tree communities separated by similar to1400 km of continuous lowland tropical forest, in an effort to understand why one was more diverse than the other. Yasuni National Park, near the equator in eastern Ecuador, has one of the most diverse tree communities in the world. Manu National Park, at 12degrees S in Peru's Madre de Dios region, is only moderately diverse by upper Amazonian standards. Following the field inventories, a database of. morphological, ecological, and other traits was compiled from the taxonomic literature for 1039 species from the plots. Our goals were (1), to describe how terra firme tree communities at the two sites differed in composition, diversity, and structure; (2) to characterize the "extra" species responsible for the higher diversity at Yasuni; and (3) to assess, in the light of those observations, some explanations for why forests near the equator are so diverse.
   Yasuni has similar to 1.4 times as many. tree species as Mann at all three spatial scales we examined: local (1 ha), landscape (<10000 km(2)), and regional (<100000 km(2)). Yasuni samples contain more families and genera, more individual trees per unit area, and a larger proportion of small trees. Tree species at Yasuni have smaller stature, larger leaves, larger seeds, and smaller geographic and altitudinal ranges than those at Manu, and disproportionate increases in species diversity are observed within the Myrtaceae, Lauraceae, Melastomataceae, and several other families. Community structures were strikingly similar, with the same species (Iriartea deltoidea, a palm) dominating both sites at identical densities. Common species at Yasuni occur at the same densities as equally ranked species at Manu, but there are substantially more very rare species at Yasuni. The poorer tree flora is not a nested subset of the richer tree flora, though a majority of species in each inventory do occur at the other site.
   Several models that offer explanations for geographic variation in tropical tree species diversity are assessed in light of these data. Most do a poor job of accounting for. the patterns revealed by the inventories. We speculate that the most important factor in producing the higher diversity in Yasuni is its rainier, aseasonal climate, and we discuss. two specific rainfall-related mechanisms that appear to be supported by the data: (1) year-round water availability allowing more species to persist in the understory at Yasuni and (2) a newly described "mixing effect" related to the higher stem density there.

AB A Bayesian approach is used to develop a method for fitting a metapopulation model (the incidence function model) to data on habitat patch occupancy, providing estimates of the five model parameters. Parameter estimation is carried out using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, and data augmentation is used to include the effect of missing data in the analysis. The Bayesian approach allows us to take into account uncertainty about the parameter estimates when making predictions with the model.
   We demonstrate the methods of parameter estimation and prediction with simulated data. We first simulated metapopulation dynamics in real habitat patch networks with given parameter values and sampled the simulated data. Parameters were estimated both from full data sets, and from data sets with data for many years treated as missing. These estimates were then used to predict the distribution of time to extinction in modified networks, where patch areas had been reduced so that the real parameter values led to metapopulation extinction within similar to30 yr. We were successfully able to fit the model and found that, in some cases, the predictions can be sensitive to one of the parameters.

AB Invasive species are frequently regarded as Superlative competitors that can vegetatively crowd Out natives, but little is known about whether invasives call compete for pollination services with native plants. We hypothesized that, when the showy invasive species Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) was present, pollinator visitation and seed set would be reduced in a native congener, L. alatum (winged loosestrife). To test this hypothesis, we constructed mixed and monospecific plots of the two species. Over two years of study, we found that L. salicaria significantly reduced both pollinator visitation and seed set in L. alatum. Furthermore, pollinators moved frequently between the two plant species, which may cause heterospecific pollen transfer. Thus, reductions in both pollen quantity and pollen quality may reduce L. alatum seed set. If similar patterns occur in the field, invasive plants may be an even greater threat to natives than previously thought.

AB The outcome of interspecific competition may be modulated by a large number of factors, both biotic and abiotic. In this paper, we examined experimentally the effects of geographic variation, population density, and abiotic stress on the outcome of interspecitic competition between two species of larval anurans. Three different populations of natteijack toad (Bufo calamita) were set to compete with common toad (Bufo bufo) in replicated artificial ponds under different combinations of osmotic stress (freshwater or brackish water) and intraspecific density (high and low). Among the B. calamita populations used, only one of them is sympatric to B. bufo and inhabits a freshwater environment. The two other populations, allopatric to B. bufo, occupy freshwater and brackish water environments, respectively. Survival, length of the larval period, and size at metamorphosis were analyzed at both the specific and the Populational interaction levels. Intra- and interspecific competition did occur and generally resulted in a decrease in survival rates, all increase in the duration of the larval period, and a decrease in size at metamorphosis. Water salinity also prolonged the larval period and interacted with intra- and interspecitic density, intensifying its effects. Interspecific competition was asymmetric, since B. bufo was competitively superior to B. calamita, causing larger effects on B. calamita than those experienced by B. bufo. However, the three populations of B. calamita showed different competitive effects and responses when they were set to compete with B. bufo. The population sympatric to B. bufo had the stronger competitive effect and response, causing a strong impact on survival, growth, and developmental rate of B. bufo). The allopatric population inhabiting the brackish environment also had a marked effect on B. bufo survival, although only at high density. The other allopatric population only had a significant effect on the size at metamorphosis of B. bufo). The impact of B. bufo on B. calamita was greater for the allopatric populations than for the sympatric one. This pattern suggests that the nature and outcome of ecological interactions are a function of environmental conditions and population history.

AB We tested the prediction that home range area and dispersal distance in mammals are related when considered independently of body size. Regression of log-transformed data demonstrated that more variance in maximum dispersal distance could be explained by home range area (74%) than could be explained by body size (50%). The relationship between maximum dispersal distance and home range size was isometric (slope = 1) when the square root of home range area (i.e., linear dimension of home range) was used. Thus, maximum dispersal distance was related to home range size by a single constant of 40. A linear relationship remained between these two variables after the effects of body size were removed (F = 31.6, df = 1, 32, P = 3.2 X 10(-6), R-2 = 0.50). A similar isometric relationship with home range size was found for median dispersal distance (related by a multiple of 7). This isometric relationship between dispersal distance and home range size was tested using a second data source: maximum movements made by mammals after translocation, which also was linearly related to home range area (F = 94.5, df = 1, 23, P = 1.3 X 10(-9), R-2 = 0.81). The slope and intercept of this relationship were not different from those of the relationship between maximum dispersal distance and home range area. We suggest that the vagility of mammals affected both home range size and dispersal distance (or movement after translocation) independently of body size, such that these movements could be predicted by home range area better than by body size alone. The resulting isometric relationship between dispersal distance and home range size has potential as a useful scaling rule for ecological practitioners.

AB In high-elevation streams of western Colorado, mayflies (Baetis bicaudatus) develop taster, but mature at a smaller size where trout are present compared to streams where fish are absent. These life history traits reduce the time of larval exposure to trout predation, but Cost reduced fecundity. We designed a field experiment involving manipulation of whole streams to determine whether these changes were caused by the presence of brook trout, and specifically, whether they could be triggered by trout chemical cues, fit 1999 and 2000. We introduced water from containers with brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) into five naturally fishless streams, and fishless stream water into live adjacent control streams to determine whether these cues alone could induce the mayfly life history traits we have observed in natural trout streams. As in previous small-scale experiments, the size at which mayflies matured declined significantly, in streams with added trout chemicals but did not change in streams with fishless water only. Thus, life history traits similar to those observed in the field were induced within the natural variability inherent ill streams. These results demonstrate the strength of this predator-prey interaction and indicate that brook trout are an important agent of natural selection oil mayfly life history traits.

AB It is likely that plant invasions result from complex interactions between species traits, community traits, and abiotic conditions. Despite this, there have been few experimental studies that directly examine these interactions. Two morphologically similar perennial grass species in the genus Cortaderia are currently invasive pest's in California, but their patterns of invasion differ. In this study I experimentally compared the performance of the two species across four vegetation types in central California. I examined how the different invasive patterns of the species result from differential responses to environmental factors that vary over relatively small spatial and temporal scales.
   Cortaderia selloana had consistently higher seed germination than C. jubata, but germination rates interacted significantly with soil disturbance and habitat type, and these interactions varied between experimental years. When mammalian herbivores were excluded, the principal cause of transplant mortality was physiological stress, and C. selloana transplants had greater survivorship than C. jubata transplants in all habitats except maritime chaparral. In the presence of mammalian herbivores, however, herbivory became the dominant source of transplant mortality, and the survivorship of both species was indistinguishable in all habitats. At the seasonal wetland site, patterns of transplant survivorship varied significantly between years, probably as a result of increased competition for water during the second experimental year. Transplants of the two species did not differ significantly in growth except at the seasonal wetland site where C. selloana transplants added significantly more leaf area than C. jubata transplants.
   These results indicate that the relative invasive potential of C. selloana and C. jubata is strongly moderated by the presence of generalist herbivores. The influence of herbivory is in turn dependent on the community type. In addition, plant competitors can modify the invasive success of the two species, but the effect of competitors varies with seasonal differences in resource supply. Although important mechanisms that influence the invasion process can be identified, the complex invasion dynamics exhibited by these morphologically similar species across relatively small spatial and temporal scales suggest that overly broad invasion rules will be of little practical utility in the regional management of invasive species.

AB The use of random, or null, models to determine whether Species co-occurrences differ from chance expectations is an established technique in community ecology. Several methods have been used to draw conclusions regarding species co-occurrence patterns. We compared a sequential method derived previously with a recently proposed now method. Despite similarities in the methods, significant mathematical differences exist. The two methods produce significantly different results on a randomly generated example. While one method was supported by mathematical theory, the proposed new method cannot be justified mathematically because the statistical test was based on sequential steps that were not independent.

AB Field experiments to test the hypothesis that a cannibalistic species is territorial are rare. We conducted two field experiments to test the hypothesis that adult females of the Mediterranean tarantula, Lycosa tarentula (L.) are territorial. In a relatively longterm experiment we placed a female intruder in an artificial burrow within the hypothesized territory of a resident. The intruders disappeared from their burrows at 7x the rate of spiders in a reference and two control treatments. Residency status, not relative size, determined whether the intruder or the resident remained, and evidence suggests that the winner frequently cannibalized the loser. We also conducted a short-term field experiment in which we induced encounters between females. The results were consistent with territorial defense because escalation was more likely if spiders were similar in size, and cannibalism, the outcome of one-third of the encounters, occurred only after escalation. Thus, adult females of the Mediterranean tarantula are territorial, and cannibalism may be a consequence of territorial defense.

AB We evaluated the potential for emergent nonlinear effects, of multiple predators on mortality of a, shared prey species by conducting experiments in cages in an old field. We examined interactions among three spider predators, Pisaurina mira, Phidippus rimator, and Rabidosa rabida, and a grasshopper prey Melanoplus femurrubrum. The predators have disparate hunting behaviors and are located in different parts of the vegetation canopy used by the grasshoppers, suggesting the potential for nonlinear effects. We examined the effects of spider species singly and in all possible combinations using a substitutive design in each of two years. Multiple predator effects on grasshopper mortality were generally the average of the corresponding single-species effects,'indicating that the species effects were largely substitutable. This result indicates that it is reasonable to aggregate these predator species into a single functional unit, despite their disparate individual effects on grasshopper prey, when modeling predator-prey interactions for this system.

AB The effect of herbivory on grassland whole-plant production is poorly understood. Herbivores can increase grassland aboveground productivity, and laboratory experiments suggest that herbivory should reduce grass root growth. However, few field studies have directly measured the response of grassland root production to herbivores. We examined the effect of native migratory ungulates on grassland primary production by comparing aboveground (NAP) and belowground (NBP) production in grazed vs. ungrazed (fenced) grassland at nine variable sites in Yellowstone National Park. NBP was determined with minirhizotrons to account for root turnover. Grazers stimulated aboveground, belowground, and whole-grassland productivity by 21%, 35%, and 32%, respectively. Root production was stimulated seven times more (217 g/m(2)) than shoot production (30 g/m(2)), indicating that the major effect of herbivores in this system was a positive feedback on root growth. Results refute the prevailing notion that grassland herbivory leads to a reduction in root productivity, and a concomitant decline in soil carbon content, and provide a potential explanation for how organic-rich soil developed in grassland that was grazed throughout millennia.

AB Protandry is the emergence or arrival into a seasonal population of males before females and is widespread among both plants and animals. Conceptually, protandry should be subject to stabilizing selection because early emerging males risk death before mating and late-emerging males miss opportunities to mate. However, for any given male, the optimal emergence time may depend upon the mean and distribution of emergence of other males in the population. Using lifetime offspring sired as our criterion of reproductive success, we found that, in laboratory populations of the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, there is, indeed, stabilizing selection acting on the optimal time for male emergence, and that the specific optimum does depend upon emergence time of other males in the population. In addition, male cohorts achieved greater reproductive success when their emergence was spread over several days rather than occurring in a single day. However, reproductive success did not differ between normal and superdispersed emergence distributions, suggesting that, under more variable, natural conditions, the specific pattern of male emergence may be far less important than variation in emergence time, per se.

AB The broad-scale factors that limit the species ranges of ticks have not been definitively established. I used environmental data covering the whole of mainland Africa and a database of 34 063 published locality records for African ticks to assess the importance of different environmental variables as limiting factors for tick species ranges. The abilities of categorical and continuous variables (including rainfall, temperature, vegetation type, a 6 x 6 degree grid, political regions, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI]) to predict tick distributions were established using a new set of methods where logistic regression equations based on different variables for each of 50 tick species are compared.
   The results show that, on average, climatic variables are better predictors of tick distributions than vegetation-related variables. Given also that most tick distributions are not limited by those of their host species. it can be inferred that the primary factor preventing the expansion of tick species ranges is the direct effect of climate. Minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and rainfall are of similar predictive ability; when considered together, their predictive ability increases substantially. I conclude that the key to describing tick distributions is the covariance of temperature and rainfall. Attempts at tick eradication are unlikely to be successful unless suitably broad areas are targeted, but the close relationship between tick distributions and climate should make the prediction of tick-borne disease outbreaks relatively easy.

AB It has recently been hypothesized that intertidal mussel beds and seaweed canopies in the Gulf of Maine are alternate community stable states or disturbance patch mosaics dominated by either seaweed or mussel communities. The community that occurs in a given site is proposed to be stochastic and dependent on the size of the original disturbance and subsequent recruit availability. Large disturbances are postulated to be dominated by mussel beds and barnacles with widely dispersed larvae, whereas smaller disturbances are dominated by seaweeds, with limited dispersal. Positive feedbacks are proposed to maintain these two communities.
   We tested this hypothesis in a tidal estuary in central Maine. At eight mussel bed and eight seaweed canopy sites, we created 9-m(2) and 1-m(2) clearings and an unmanipulated control area, and in each plot established control, caged, and cage control quadrats. After three years of monitoring, our results do not support the alternate stable state hypothesis. Instead, they suggest that the occurrence of mussel beds and seaweed canopies is highly deterministic. Seaweed canopies dominate habitats with relatively little water movement, whereas mussel beds dominate habitats with high flows; and largely independent of disturbance size, mussel beds and seaweed canopies rapidly returned to their original community type, but only in the absence of consumers (crabs and snails). With consumers present, neither community showed significant signs of recovery, even after three years. In the presence of consumers, community recovery appears to be dependent on cracks and crevices providing refuges from consumers to seaweed and mussel recruits.
   The idea that natural communities may represent stochastically determined alternate stable states has important implications for understanding and managing natural ecosystems, but the very existence of alternate stable states in nature has been difficult to establish. Our results suggest that intertidal seaweed canopies and mussel beds in tidal rivers in the Gulf of Maine are highly deterministic alternative community states under consumer control. More generally, since all proposed examples of alternate community stable states are based on indirect, inferential evidence, our results imply that stochastically determined alternate community stable states might be an interesting theoretical idea without a definitive empirical example.

AB Ecological interactions among invading species are common and may often be important in facilitating invasions. Indeed, the presence of one nonindigenous species can act as an agent of disturbance that facilitates the invasion of a second species. However, most studies of nonindigenous species are anecdotal and do not provide substantive evidence that interactions among nonindigenous species have any community-level effects. Here, using a combination of field experiments and observations we examine interactions among introduced species in New England kelp forests and ask whether these interactions have altered paradigms describing subtidal communities in the Gulf of Maine. The green alga Codium fragile was observed at the Isles of Shoals, Maine, USA, in 1983 and has since replaced the native kelp as the dominant seaweed on leeward shores. Experiments manipulating kelp and Codium reveal that Codium does not directly inhibit growth or survival of kelp. Codium does, however, successfully recruit to gaps in the kelp bed and, once established, inhibits recruitment of kelp. A second nonindigenous species, Membranipora membranacea, grows epiphytically on kelp, and experiments reveal that the presence of Membranipora reduces growth and survival of kelp, resulting in defoliation of kelp plants and gap formation in kelp beds. In the absence of Codium, kelp recolonizes these gaps, but when present, Codium colonizes and prevents kelp recolonization. Manipulations of herbivores demonstrate that herbivory will reinforce Codium dominance. Thus, the demise of New England kelp beds appears to result from one invasive species facilitating the spread of a second nonindigenous species.

AB Herbivore damage is generally detrimental to plant fitness, and the evolutionary response of plant populations to damage can involve either increased resistance or increased tolerance. While characters that contribute to resistance, such as secondary chemicals and trichomes, are relatively well understood, characters that contribute to a plant's ability to tolerate damage have received much less attention. Using Helianthus annuus (wild sunflower) and simulated damage of Haplorhynchites aeneus (head-clipping weevil) as a model system, we examined morphological characters and developmental processes that contribute to compensatory ability. We performed a factorial experiment that included three levels of damage (none, the first two, or the first four inflorescences were clipped with scissors) and eight sires each mated to four dams,. We found that plants compensated fully for simulated head-clipper damage and that there was no variation among plant families in compensatory ability: seed production and mean-seed mass did not vary among treatments, and sire X treatment interactions were not significant. Plants used four mechanisms to compensate for damage: (1) Clipped plants produced significantly more inflorescences than unclipped plants. Plants produced these additional inflorescences on higher order branches at the end of the flowering season. (2) Clipped plants filled significantly more seeds in their remaining heads than did unclipped plants. (3) Clipped plants, because they effectively flowered later than unclipped plants, were less susceptible to damage by seed-feeding herbivores other than Haplorhynchites. (4) In later heads, seed size was greater on clipped plants, which allowed mean seed size to be maintained in clipped plants. Although there was genetic variation among the families used in this experiment for most of the characters associated with compensation for damage (seed number, mean seed size, mean flowering date, length of the flowering period, and branching morphology), in analyses of these characters, no sire X treatment interactions were significant indicating that all of the families relied on Similar mechanisms to compensate for damage.

AB We examined the relationship between planktonic primary production (PP) and bacterial production (BP) in 16 subarctic lakes along an altitude gradient extending from colored coniferous forest lakes to clearwater high alpine lakes. We tested the hypothesis that there was a shift from low to high PP:BP ratios along this gradient. The clearwater alpine lakes had low PP:BP ratios, generally well below 1.0, while the highest ratios were-found in the forest lakes. In contradiction to our hypothesis, the pelagic systems of the clearwater lakes were thus dominated by bacterial energy mobilization from external carbon sources. In this respect the alpine lakes were similar to highly humic lakes. We suggest that the relationship between C, N, and P plays a critical role in determining the PP:BP ratio, and that the N:P ratio in particular can be critical for development of PP or BP dominance in the pelagic systems of unproductive lakes.

AB We examined the hypothesis that tree-ring analyses of juvenile growth traits could be used to predict herbivory during mature years. At Sunset Crater National Monument, Arizona, USA, some pinyon pines (Pinus edulis) are highly susceptible to the stem-boring moth, Dioryctria albovittella, and suffer chronic attack, while other adjacent trees are resistant and have remained relatively moth-free for years. Five major patterns emerged: (1) Susceptible trees suffer from 11 times more shoots killed per tree and produce <0.05 times as many cones as resistant trees. (2) This herbivore is largely restricted to reproductively mature trees that, at this site, are generally older than 46 yr. (3) Analysis of tree-ring. data from resistant and susceptible trees shows that trees that eventually became susceptible grew more vigorously during their attack-free juvenile years than resistant trees (growth rings were 29% wider). However, when they matured and suffered chronic herbivory, susceptible trees produced growth rings 13% smaller than resistant trees. (4) Although previous studies showed that resistance was associated with,higher oleoresin flow, we did not observe this pattern. Instead, we found that resistance was best correlated with slower juvenile growth rates. Current-year shoots of susceptible mature trees averaged 50% larger than those on resistant mature trees. (5) Tree-ring analyses supported the hypothesis of a trade-off between growth and resistance. This study shows that dendrochronology can be used as a tool to predict future herbivory and demonstrates that the fastest growing juvenile trees suffer the poorest performance decades later when they become moth-susceptible mature trees. Furthermore, it illustrates that traits associated with plant development can greatly affect herbivore distributions, and that herbivore selection pressures on juvenile trees can be very different than on mature trees.

AB We tested the hypothesis that herbivory accelerates nutrient cycling through nutrient-rich soils and decelerates nutrient cycling through nutrient-poor soils in a well-drained arctic tundra heath by measuring effects of herbivory on soil and plant properties in control areas and areas treated with NPK fertilizer. The impact of herbivores was studied with two types of exclosures, one excluding reindeer and the other excluding both rodents and reindeer. We predicted that herbivores would enhance soil microbial processes in the fertilized areas, but retard them in the unfertilized ones.
   Microbial respiration and microbial C were significantly lower in grazed areas than in herbivore exclosures in both unfertilized and fertilized treatments, indicating that herbivores limit the C available for the soil microbes. Microbial, N was significantly increased in the exclosures in the fertilized treatment, but there were no effects in the unfertilized one. This reflects both an increase in resources by fertilization and the effect of herbivores on microbial N acquisition: there was surplus N in the fertilized areas to be immobilized by microbial biomass only when access by herbivores was prevented. Thus, mammalian grazers affect the resource coupling between the plant and microbial trophic levels. Fertilization did not affect the soil inorganic, organic, or microbial N contents, or litter decomposition rates, but it significantly increased soil and microbial P. Microbial C was significantly decreased by fertilization, contradicting some earlier fertilization studies in the arctic.
   One reason for deceleration of soil nutrient cycling in our study area may be that herbivory by both reindeer and rodents occurs mainly outside the growing season; hence, mammalian waste products do not contribute to soil nutrient availability at the times of highest nutrient demands by plants. In addition, grazing during reindeer migrations is likely to cause net resource output from the system.

AB Field estimates of seed removal rates are often determined by monitoring the survival of seeds placed at stations. Such experiments may unintentionally provide seed predators with unnatural olfactory cues. We compared the removal of seeds that had direct contact with human skin (scented) vs. seeds that had no contact with human skin (unscented). At three Florida sites in 1997-1998, four to five species were tested by placing five conspecific seeds at each station; 40-50 stations per species. per treatment, per site were monitored for 30 d. Seed removal was greater for scented than unscented seeds, but most differences were significant only with all species and sites pooled. At two Illinois sites and one Florida site in 1999-2000, one seed of one of two species was placed at each of 400 stations and monitored for 30 d. Scented seeds were removed significantly faster than unscented seeds at Illinois sites (14% scented vs. 5% unscented removed after one day), but not at the Florida site. The effect of scent on removal was pronounced during the first week, then disappeared. Fortunately, these results suggest scent biases are weak and short-lived, and most studies are unaffected. Studies that may be affected are those of short duration.

ID MEANINGFUL
AB Diffusion approximation (DA) methods provide a powerful tool for population viability analysis (PVA) using simple time series of population counts. The e methods have a strong theoretical foundation based on stochastic age-structured models, but their application to data with high sampling error or age-structure cycles has been problematic. Recently, a new method was developed for estimating DA parameters from highly corrupted time series. We conducted an extensive cross-validation of this new method using 189 long-term time series of salmon counts with very high sampling error and nonstable age-structure fluctuations. Parameters were estimated from one segment of a time series, and a subsequent segment was used to evaluate the predictions regarding the risk of crossing population thresholds. We also tested the theoretical distributions of the estimated parameters. The distribution of parameter estimates is an essential aspect of a PVA because it-allows one to calculate confidence levels for risk metrics. This study is the first data-based cross-validation of these theoretical distributions. Our cross-validation analyses found that, when parameterization methods designed for corrupted data sets are used, DA predictions are very robust even for problematic data. Estimates of the probability of crossing population thresholds were unbiased, and the estimated parameters closely followed the expected theoretical distributions.

AB To examine the hypothesis that intra-plant oviposition preferences of Manduca quinquemaculata on Nicotiana attenuata optimize predation risk and nutritional needs of developing larvae and eggs, we measured oviposition behavior of adults and larval mortality, movement, performance, and body temperatures at different leaf positions in a natural population. Nearly 70% of the eggs were oviposited on young central stern leaves of elongated plants. [Intra-plant movement was very rare in the first and common in the second to fourth larval instars. The oviposition preference for, and larval movement toward, younger leaves was correlated with a 40% lower predation risk and a 6.3-fold greater mass gain, suggesting higher nutritive value despite 2.1-fold higher nicotine concentrations and 4.6-fold higher polyphenol oxidase activities. The predatory bug, Geocoris pallens, which consumed eggs and larvae with instar- and leaf position-specific preferences, was responsible for the vast majority of M. quinquemaculata mortality and may shape the moth's oviposition preference.

AB From 1996 to 1999, apparent annual survival of male Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) was compared in forest fragments created by forestry (n = 3) and agriculture (n = 14) to plots in continuous boreal forest of central Saskatchewan (n = 3). For 398 male Ovenbirds, Cormack-Jolly-Seber models indicated that apparent annual survival was lower (34%) in small forest fragments (< 15 ha) in the agricultural landscape than in forestry fragments (56%) or continuous forest (62%). Our results suggested that lower nesting and pairing success in small forest fragments caused individuals to permanently disperse in search of new territories, rather than fragmentation increasing mortality. Regardless of the mechanism, increased turnover of adult males altered the age structure of the population in small forest fragments, as more males were first-time breeders in fragments in the agricultural landscape (59%) than in forestry fragments (47%) or continuous forest (45%). Males recruited into fragments in the agricultural landscape were more likely (90%) to be first-time breeders than in forestry fragments (74%) or continuous forest (64%). Our results suggest that adult dispersal differs with the amount and type of fragmentation and may play an important role in the population dynamics of boreal forest songbird populations.

AB Wolf (Canis hipus) kill rates, factors affecting their variation, and predation impact on ungulates were studied in the Polish part of Bialowieza Primeval Forest (580 km(2)). With the mean size of hunting groups being 4.4 individuals, wolves killed, on average, 0.513 +/- 0.04 prey.(pack)(-1).d(-1) (mean +/- 1 SE); 63% of prey were red deer (Cervus elaphus), 28% were wild boar (Sits scrofa), and 4% were roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Per capita kill rate averaged 0.116 ungulates.(wolf)(-1).d(-1), and daily food intake was 5.58 +/- 0.32 kg.(wolf)(-1).d(-1). Kill rate on red deer was affected by snow cover (P < 0.001). A pack of wolves killed, on average, 0.264 deer/d in seasons with no snow and 0.587 deer/d when snow was 17 cm deep. The increase in kill rates coincided with a decline in the condition of juvenile (but not adult) deer in late winter (mean marrow fat content in the femur 66% in October-January vs. 27% in February-March). Per capita kill rates decreased slightly (not significantly) with the increasing size of wolf hunting group. However, the amount of food acquired per wolf did not differ among groups containing 2-6 individuals, because larger packs killed bigger prey more often and small prey less frequently than did small packs. Wolf kill rates on wild boar were higher in spring-summer (0.242 +/- 0.06 boar.(pack)(-1).d(-1)), when piglets were present, than in autumn-winter (0.106 +/- 0.04 boar.(pack)(-1).d(-1)). Annually, wolves killed on average 72 red deer, 16 roe deer, and 31 wild boar over a 100-km(2) area. Compared to prey densities, wolves were an important agent of mortality for red deer only, taking annually 12% of spring-summer (seasonally highest) numbers of deer, which was equivalent to 40%, of deer annual increase due to breeding and 40% of their annual mortality. Compared to winter densities (3-6 deer/km(2)), percentage predation by wolves was inversely density dependent; thus wolves limited deer numbers but did not regulate prey population. By eliminating a substantial proportion of the annual production of the deer population, wolves hamper its growth and prolong the time until it reaches carrying capacity of the habitat. However, wolf predation alone is a poor predictor of deer population dynamics, because deer are also subject to lynx (Lynx lynx) predation and hunting harvest.

AB In the arid southwestern United States, subtle differences in soil horizon development affect seasonal soil hydrology and consequently influence plant performance and community structure. We measured canopy development, population structure, and seasonal ecophysiology (predawn water potential,psi(pd) and midday net photosynthetic assimilation, A(net)) of two co-dominant warm-desert Shrubs, the evergreen Larren tridentata and drought-deciduous Ambrosia duntosa, in five Mojave Desert soils varying in surface and sub-surface soil development, and we used process-bused soil hydrology modeling output to determine longer-term soil water dynamics underlying soil/plant responses. We hypothesized that eeophysiological performance would covary with plant development, which would reflect soil hydrological characteristics.
   Among three sites on alluvial fan deposits of different geological ages (Young Alluvial, <4000 yr BP; Intermediate Alluvial, similar to12000 yr BP; Old Alluvial, similar to40000 yr BP), total canopy volume of Larrea (cubic meters per 100 m(2) ground area) was highest on the Young Alluvial site, in close agreement with soil modeling results showing that these coarse-textured. weakly developed soils permit deeper water infiltration. In older, stronger developed soils, infiltration and persistence of soil water was sharply reduced, which was reflected by lower individual Larrea plant volumes. However, during peak spring conditions, psi(pd) and A(net) were highest in Larrea at the Intermediate Alluvial site (-4.2 +/- 0.32 MPa and 3.2 +/- 0.91 mumol(.)m(-2.)s(-2)). where soils had substantial surface and subsurface horizons, and at the pavement site, where soils had strong surface layers but little subsurface development. Concurrent plant performance at the Young Alluvial site was unexpectedly low (-4.8 +/- 0.-19 MPa and 1.7 +/- 0.56 mumol(.)m(-2.)s(-1) , respectively). During summer drought psi(pd) and A(net) remained high in Intermediate Alluvial plants, but were extremely low in Pavement site Larrea (-8.17 MPa and -0.04 mumol(.)m(-2.)s(-1), respectively), due to curtailed infiltration of summer precipitation. These findings suggest that Larrea growing in older soils experience greater mortality and reduced growth but are not subject to strong intra-specific competition resulting from the persistence of large individuals apparent in younger, coarser textured Soils.
   In contrast to Larrea, density of Ambrosia increased with soil horizon development, but smaller plant sizes resulted in similar canopy volume per area, and identical psi(pd) and A(net) across all soils where it occurred, suggesting greater plasticity to the transmittal of precipitation. These findings show that a strong geomorphology and soils context is essential for understanding the variation in plant responses and vegetation Structure in desert environments.

AB The (K) over cap (d) function is a summary statistic of all plant-plant distances in a mapped area. It offers the potential for detecting both different types and scales of patterns in a single map. Two types of errors occur in maps of individual plants, Data management errors, caused by transcription errors or other mishandling, are large errors and apply to small numbers of plants. Measurement errors, caused by the mapping techniques and equipment, are small errors that apply to all plants. Simulation of known spatial patterns combined with increasing levels of both types of error showed that: (1) data management errors cause the spatial patterns identified by the statistical function (K) over cap (d) to become less significant but do not cause a shift in scale of the identified patterns; and (2) measurement errors caused the spatial patterns identified by (K) over cap (d) to become less significant and to shift to larger scales. The effects of measurement errors are inversely proportional to the scale of interaction between plants on the map. Detection of inhibition between points is more sensitive to measurement error than detection of clustering; detection of small clusters is more sensitive than detection of large clusters; and measurement error tends to cause an overestimation of clumping size. For patterns with inhibition, estimating minimum establishment distance is more sensitive to error than the maximum distance at which inhibition affects survival probability.
   Two examples of tree spatial distributions from the Wind River Canopy Crane Research Facility stem map data set were analyzed using the (K) over cap (d) function. Clusters of Thuja plicata were detected and were much larger than levels of mapping error identified in the data. Significant inhibition occurs between large (dbh greater than or equal to20 cm) trees of all species at a scale much greater than the level of mapping error. However, the minimum distance of significant inhibition (i.e., the distance within which neighbors are never found) was on the order of the mapping error. Accurate identification of inhibition may not be possible using (K) over cap (d).

AB Using a long-term data set on the fluctuations of a reintroduced Swiss population of ibex we estimated the parameters in a stochastic population model with theta-logistic density regulation, and how the environmental stochasticity was related to different. climate variables. Our aim was to examine quantitatively the relative effects of variation in parameters describing the expected dynamics and the environmental stochasticity as well as the uncertainties in them for the development of reliable. population projections. The specific growth rate r(1) was 0.14. Density regulation mainly happened close to the carrying capacity K, indicating that the commonly used assumption in population ecology of loglinear density regulation is not always valid. Annual variation in the point estimates of the environmental stochasticity was correlated with winter climate. Uncertainties in parameter estimates were high, especially in the estimates of density regulation and r(1). In order to examine the dynamical consequences of the estimates as well as the uncertainties in them, we constructed Population Prediction Intervals (PPI). A PPI is the stochastic interval that includes the unknown population size with probability (1-alpha). Analyses of factors affecting the width of the PPI showed that the form of the density regulation as well as uncertainties in model parameters should be estimated when making projections of future fluctuations of introduced populations.

AB Reduced water depth in dry years has been proposed to interact with ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation and a pathogenic fungus to cause episodes of high mortality of amphibian embryos. Observations of breeding phenology of boreal chorus frogs (Pseudacris maculata) in Colorado from 1986 to 2001 show that dry years result in earlier breeding. The earliest and latest dates of maximum calling activity by males were 20 May and 16 June, and the date of maximum calling was strongly related to the amount of snow accumulation during the winter. Surface UV-B flux, estimated from satellite-based measurements, was positively related to date of maximum calling. In dry years, surface UV-B during calling was reduced by an amount similar to that attributed to reduced depth. Although there was a significant trend of increasing UV-B from 1978 to 2001 on the average date (2 June) of maximum calling activity, there was no relationship between year and surface UV-B at actual dates of maximum calling. Exposure to extreme temperatures is an alternative explanation for increased mortality of:amphibian embryos in shallow water.

AB I investigated the separate and joint effects of herbivory (grazing) and competition on six grass species and on their distributions across the landscape. In a factorial field experiment, cattle were excluded from half the subplots, and neighboring plants were removed from half the subplots. Transplants of each of the species were planted in plots on hillsides and in flat areas, and the entire experiment was replicated in two pastures.
   The effects of grazing were negative and were proportional to the ungrazed height of each species. In the absence of grazing and competition, the flat plots were more favorable than the hillside plots. Grazing reversed the relative favorableness of flat and hillside plots, most likely because grazing was more intense in the flat plots due to cattle preference for flatter ground. The removal of neighboring plants always had a positive effect, indicating competition from neighboring plants. The relative impact of competition from pre-existing plants was generally greater in the flat plots than in the hillside plots.
   The relative impacts of grazing were generally greater in the absence of competing plants, and the relative impacts of competition were generally greater in the absence of grazing. The most likely explanation for this antagonistic interaction between the effects of herbivory and competition is an indirect positive effect of grazing that arose from a reduction in competition experienced by a target plant due to the defoliation of its neighbors.
   The results of this study, when combined with the known distributions of the six grass species in this region, indicate that herbivory, rather than competition or the physical environment, controls the distribution of at least five of the six species across the landscape. For example, Schizachyrium scoparium grew well in ungrazed flat subplots but very poorly in grazed flat subplots; grazing, got the physical environment or competition, accounts for the absence of S. scoparium from most flat sites in this region. Competition modulates the effects of herbivory and edaphic factors on landscape distributions but does not control the distribution of any, of the six species.

AB In most communities, a considerable number of the Constituent species will only occupy a small percentage of sites or habitat patches. However, the factors that limit the distribution and abundance of rare species are seldom examined and are poorly understood. I tested several explanations of landscape-scale rarity in the New England cobble beach plant community, an assemblage of halophytic forbs associated with fringing beds of the marine intertidal grass Spartina alterniflora. Spartina reduces flow velocity and stabilizes the cobble Substrate, thereby reducing the burial of seeds and seedlings of other species. Frequencies of the presence of forb species behind 387 sampled Spartina beds distributed along 120 km of shoreline in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA. ranged from 0.005 to 0.382. Both the whole forb assemblage and individual species were strongly nested with respect to patch size and species richness. Species that were rare oil a landscape scale were generally only found behind the longest beds. and bed length was positively related to species diversity. Experimental seed additions to 40 beds ranging in length from 8 to 688 m indicated that intermediate-sized beds often occupied by common species are not habitable by three rare forbs. When present behind the longest beds, these rare species are always associated with a microhabitat characterized by a relatively fine-grained and highly stable Substrate. A series of Substrate manipulations combined with experimental seed additions indicated that the rare annuals Spergularia marina, Salicornia biglovii, and Atriplex arenaria are restricted to the longest Spartina beds because smaller beds lack suitable substrate. These experiments also. Suggest that seed supply. competitors, and herbivores are not the proximate causes of the absence of these species from smaller beds. although dispersal limitation may prevent the colonization of many larger habitable patches. The microhabitat required by the rare forbs appears to be generated by the deposition of fine-grained particles behind the center of the longest Spartina beds. Consequently. bed length is causally related to the distribution of populations at a landscape scale and to species richness and composition at the scale of a whole habitat patch.

AB The Mediterranean perennial herb Lobularia maritima shows an exceptionally extended flowering and fruiting that lasts for 10 months, from early September to late June. We hypothesized that such an extended phenology may be a flexible mechanism that enhances population persistence in variable Mediterranean environments, as fecundity in one part of the season could compensate for reproductive failure in another part of the season. We predicted that (1) fecundities throughout the year would significantly contribute to mean population growth rate lambda, (2) negative covariances among fecundities in different periods of the year would reduce variance in population growth rate, and (3) extended flowering and fruiting would enhance long-term stochastic population growth rates. We used a periodic matrix model to describe the demography of a L. maritima population over five years, in which each year was divided into six periods of two months each.
   Population growth rates varied from a low of 0.25 to a high of 4.81 over the five years of study. Periodic elasticity analyses revealed that fecundities in the first two periods of the year, i.e., the autumn periods, were the major determinants of population growth in most of the years, rather than fecundities over the whole flowering and fruiting season. Variation in the autumn fecundities also made the largest contribution to the observed variance in X. Hence, unlike earlier generalizations, highly variable parameters also had relatively high elasticities. As predicted, negative covariances appeared between the fecundities, but only between those of the two autumn periods. These negative covariances were interpreted as a flexible mechanism to tailor the onset of reproduction to the start of the autumn rains, thereby reducing the variance in X. We used stochastic matrix models to investigate the effect of different reproductive strategies on stochastic population growth rate. We created hypothetical populations with either an even distribution of fecundity throughout the year or with concentrated flowering and fruiting in autumn or in spring. Stochastic population growth rates were high if a major part of the reproduction remained in autumn. A hypothetically even distribution of fecundities over the entire flowering season increased both the mean and the variance in X, with little overall effect on stochastic Population growth rate.
   All together, our results indicate that a reproductive failure of L. maritima in autumn cannot be compensated for by reproduction in winter and spring. The extended flowering and fruiting season thus has very little effect on the population dynamics of the species. Alternative explanations for the unusual phenology of L. maritima in the Mediterranean environment are discussed.

AB We introduce a heuristic model for studying the evolution of ecological ideas based on Thomas Kuhn's concept of the development of scientific paradigms. This model is useful for examining processes leading to ecological progress and the elaboration of ecological theories. Over time, ecological knowledge diverges and evolves as data are collected that either refute or support the current trajectories of accepted paradigms. As a result, the direction of ecological research continuously branches out into new domains leading to increased ecological understanding. Unfortunately, heightened ecological understanding also builds impediments to future progress. Increased specialization and the parallel evolution of seemingly independent subdisciplines generally compel researchers to become increasingly canalized. Specialization also accelerates the expansion of the ecological literature, making it difficult for researchers to track developments in their own subdisciplines, let alone the general field of ecology. Furthermore, specialization inherently focuses attention on contemporary research and hastens the erasure of memory of historical contributions to modern ecology. As a result, contemporary ecologists art in danger of losing touch with their historical roots and face a greater likelihood of recycling ideas and impeding real scientific momentum. Enhancing our historical perspective on the evolution of ecological ideas will be key in overcoming the negative consequences of progress and safeguarding the continued advancement of ecology.

AB We employed a combination of factorial experiments in the field and laboratory to investigate the relative magnitude and degree of interaction of bottom-up factors (two levels each of host-plant nutrition and vegetation complexity) and top-down forces (two levels of wolf-spider predation) on the population growth of Prokelisia planthoppers (P. dolus and P. marginata), the dominant insect herbivores on Spartina cordgrass throughout the intertidal marshes of North America. Treatments were designed to mimic combinations of plant characteristics and predator densities that occur naturally across habitats in the field.
   There were complex interactive effects between plant resources and spider predation on the population growth of planthoppers. The degree that spiders suppressed planthoppers depended on both plant nutrition and vegetation complexity, an interaction that was demonstrated both in the field and laboratory. Laboratory results showed that spiders checked planthopper populations most effectively on poor-quality Spartina with an associated matrix of thatch, all characteristics of high-marsh meadow habitats. It was also this combination of plant resources in concert with spiders that promoted the smallest populations of planthoppers in our field experiment. Planthopper populations were most likely to escape the suppressing effects of predation on nutritious plants without thatch, a combination of factors associated with observed planthopper outbreaks in low-marsh habitats in the field. Thus, there is important spatial variation in the relative strength of forces with bottom-up factors dominating under low-marsh conditions and top-down forces increasing in strength at higher elevations on the marsh.
   Enhancing host-plant biomass and nutrition did not strengthen top-down effects on planthoppers, even though nitro-en-rich plants supported higher densities of wolf spiders and other invertebrate predators in the field. Rather, planthopper populations, particularly those of Prokelisia marginata, escaped predator restraint on high-quality plants, a result we attribute to its mobile life history, enhanced colonizing ability, and rapid growth rate. Thus, our results for Prokelisia planthoppers suggest that the life history strategy of a species is an important mediator of top-down and bottom-up impacts.
   In laboratory mesocosms, enhancing plant biomass and nutrition resulted in increased spider reproduction, a,cascading effect associated with planthopper increases on high-quality plants. Although the adverse effects of spider predation on planthoppers cascaded down and fostered increased plant biomass in laboratory mesocosms, this result did not occur in the field where top-down effects attenuated. We attributed this outcome in part to the intraguild predation of other planthopper predators by wolf spiders. Overall, the general paradigm in this system is for bottom-up forces to dominate, and when predators do exert a significant suppressing effect on planthoppers, their impact is generally legislated by vegetation characteristics.

AB Models of semiarid vegetation dynamics incorporating concepts of equilibrium and stability have been largely replaced by nonequilibrium models in recent years. However, neither equilibrium nor disequilibrium and neither stability nor instability have been formally demonstrated. Most records of semiarid vegetation are inadequate for conclusive tests. We tested for equilibrium at seven study sites in six locations and vegetation types, in grazed semiarid grassland in central Otago, New Zealand, using data collected twice annually over 5-13 yr. Some sites showed overall directional change in composition over time, but others appeared to fluctuate about an average equilibrium state. At one site, an instantaneous perturbation experiment was used to test formally for stability, and to seek evidence for intrinsic stabilizing processes. In this experiment, three herbicide treatments removed or decreased different components of the community, and recovery and convergence with the untreated control was monitored over time. Although all exotic species increased or rapidly re-invaded the treated plots, many native species failed to re-invade, and treatments had not recovered by 194 wk after perturbation. We conclude that the vegetation is not stable, but that some stabilizing processes are evident. Contrary to some nonequilibrium theory, we observed strong competitive interactions between species. We suggest that New Zealand semiarid vegetation exists on a continuum between equilibrium and nonequilibrium dynamics.

AB Although understanding of nitrogen cycling and nitrification in forest ecosystems has improved greatly over the past several decades, our ability to characterize spatial patterns is still quite limited. A number of studies have shown linkages between canopy chemistry and N cycling, but few have considered the degree to which these trends can provide an indicator of forest N status across large, heterogeneous landscapes. In this study, we examined relationships among canopy chemistry, nitrogen cycling, and soil carbon: nitrogen ratios across 30 forested stands in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Plots included a range of species (sugar maple, red maple, American beech, yellow birch, paper birch, red spruce, balsam fir, eastern hemlock) and were broadly grouped into two disturbance categories: those that were historically affected by intensive logging and/or fire and those that experienced minimal human disturbance.
   Across all plots, rates of not N mineralization and net nitrification were correlated with canopy nitrogen concentrations, but the relationships differed between disturbance treatments. In deciduous forests, historically undisturbed stands had significantly higher rates of net N mineralization and net nitrification than previously disturbed stands, but these differences were not clearly reflected in patterns of stand-level canopy chemistry. Although soil C:N ratios also differed between disturbed and undisturbed stands, a relationship between soil C:N ratios and canopy lignin:N ratios did not vary with either forest type or disturbance, suggesting that this trend is more consistent across diverse conditions.
   Relationships between foliar chemistry and N cycling within individual species revealed interesting differences between species and functional groups. For four out of five deciduous species, foliar N increased with increasing net N mineralization, indicating, that species were responsive to changes in N availability and suggesting a positive feedback between foliar chemistry and soil N status. These patterns led to significant differences in foliar N between disturbance treatments for some species, but at the stand level, these differences were masked by successional changes in species composition. Among coniferous species, foliar N showed no variation across wide N-cycling gradients, suggesting a fundamentally different plant-soil interaction.
   We also examined the potential for extending observed field relationships to the regional level using a high-quality data set of high spectral resolution remote sensing, obtained from NASA's AVIRIS instrument (Airborne Visible and InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer). Cloud-free AVIRIS data from 56 scenes covering the White Mountain National Forest were calibrated to canopy lignin:N ratios and were applied to prediction of C:N ratios in soils. Validation at 10 independent plots showed good prediction accuracy but suggested some overprediction at the low end of the range. Preliminary regional estimates of soil C:N ratios indicate that 63% of the region's land area falls below a value of 22. This value is significant because our field data identified this as a critical threshold for the onset of nitrification. Below C:N = 22, we expect increasing but variable rates of nitrification, depending on other factors such as disturbance or species composition.

AB Nest-site selection behavior is a maternal effect that contributes to offspring survival and variation in offspring phenotypes that are subject to natural selection. We investigated nest-site selection and its consequences in the snapping turtle, Chelydra serpentina, in northwestern Illinois. We evaluated nest-site selection at both the microhabitat and habitat patch levels. Turtles selected nest sites with shorter vegetation, more open sand. and fewer cacti than random locations. These microhabitat characteristics described sandy patches where both nest density and success were higher compared to grassy patches in 1999. We subsequently investigated nest-site selection within two discrete subdivisions of the study area that varied in the degree of human disturbance to determine if nesting behavior, nest success, or nest temperatures were affected. The tendency to nest in sandy patches was much stronger at the natural site due to habitat modifications at the residential site that have blurred the distinction between sandy and grassy patches. Additionally, the residential site had a high density of nests within 5 m of houses and a fence (both areas with disturbed habitat similar to sandy patches), compared to the overall density. Thus, nest success associated with sandy patches may be compromised at the residential site; an ecological trap may result in lower nest success in areas with preferred microhabitat characteristics. Despite a similar basis for nest-site selection in terms of microhabitat characteristics at both sites. nest temperatures were correlated with microhabitat characteristics used to select nest sites only at the natural site. Nest temperatures at the residential site were instead correlated only with the percentage overstory vegetation cover and therefore averaged 2degreesC lower than at the natural site, a temperature difference that influenced offspring sex. The higher percentage overstory vegetation cover at the residential site was due to human alterations of the habitat, and may serve to extend the ecological trap biasing the sex ratio of this population. This study illustrates the importance of (1) nest-site selection as a substantive maternal effect, (2) understanding habitat use during crucial life-history events, and (3) the potential for human disturbance to modify offspring phenotypes and negatively impact nest success despite adaptive nesting behavior.

AB Although communities of generalist invertebrate predators are known to be capable of suppressing pests, little is known about the long-term population dynamics of individual species of generalist predators and single classes of prey in the field. We present evidence of a dynamic interaction between a generalist insect predator. the carabid beetle Pterostichus melanarius, and its slug prey.
   We analyzed the numbers of slugs and beetles in an arable field over a 5-yr period, during the main activity period of the beetles from June to September. The field contained 25 plots comprising five replicates of five cultural treatments. An index of the nutritional status of the 8497 beetles collected was obtained by weighing the crop of each beetle (a measure of total prey availability per predator).
   There was a strong relationship between the crop mass of the beetles and slug numbers in the soil, indicating that slugs were a major part of the diet of the beetles. The change in the beetle population from year to year was strongly related to both slug numbers in the soil and the crop mass of the beetles. This indicated that the slugs influenced the nutritional status, and hence the reproductive success. of the beetles. The predators had a significant effect on slug population growth between years but not between months within years. The temporal effect of these processes was a between-year coupling of beetle and slug population dynamics, buffered by feeding on other prey. The relationship appears to be similar to that between mammalian predators and limited numbers of prey species in the subarctic. where one prey species forms a substantial proportion of the total available food resources. Such relationships may be common in agroecosystems, where species diversity is low, and may be a significant factor driving periodic fluctuations in the abundance of both predators and pests.

AB Body size influences many physiological and ecological processes, and thus adaptive change in body size may hold diverse consequences for individuals. For amphipods in the Hyalella azteca species complex, divergence in body size appears to be driven by adaptation to disparate regimes of size-biased mortality experienced in different habitat types. Here I ask how size and size-related traits influence competitive ability of large-bodied and small-bodied species. I examined competitive ability in both species using a factorial experiment in which the performance of each species was assessed in all combinations of the presence and absence of the heterospecific amphipod species crossed with the presence and absence of a snail species. Results demonstrated that the large and small Hyalella species differ substantially in competitive ability, with the large species being the superior general competitor. The competitive effect of the large species on the small species was substantial and caused significant reductions in abundance, body size, and fecundity of the small species. In contrast, performance of the large species was not affected significantly by presence of the small species. This competitive asymmetry was also seen in competitive interactions with snails. The small species appears to "trade off" competitive ability in order to survive in habitats with predatory fish, whereas the large species. which is able to obtain a size refuge from predation, has traits that confer strong competitive ability. Because of habitat differences in the cost-benefit structure of the trade-off, however, competition-mediated natural selection may be more intense in the large species than in the small species, a condition that may enhance evolutionary divergence in body size.

AB Rivers and river lakes, i.e., lakes that are part of river systems, provide distinctive geomorphic and hydrologic conditions for riparian plants. This variation between lotic and lentic water bodies results in various environments for establishment and growth of plants, but also presents a range of conditions under which plant propagules are transported and deposited along riverbanks and lakeshores. Propagules may be differentially deposited in specific types of fluvial settings depending on their buoyancy. Among riverbanks and lakeshores, we predicted that lakeshores would capture the highest proportion of long-floating seeds, because short floaters will sink before reaching the shoreline. We also predicted that turbulent reaches would receive the highest proportion of short-floating seeds, because these are the sections where buoyancy is least important. Tranquil reaches of rivers were predicted to be intermediate between turbulent reaches and lakes with respect to their efficiency in capturing of long- and short-floating seeds. We tested whether these differences were mirrored in the floras of the different reach types, using reaches of a range of current velocities in 67 sites along a free-flowing river system in northern Sweden. We also related floristic differences to environmental conditions in each of the three reach types (turbulent sections, tranquil sections, and river lakes).
   The proportions of species with long-floating propagules, herbs, and aquatic species were higher along river lakeshores and tranquil reaches than along turbulent reaches, and the opposite was, true for species with short-floating propagules, dwarf shrubs, graminoids, and terrestrial species. The patterns remained when the largest species groups (herbs and graminoids) were tested for floating ability, i.e., the highest proportions of long-floating herbs and graminoids were found in lakes, and the lowest in turbulent reaches; tranquil reaches were intermediate or similar to lakes. Exposure to waves and currents and peat cover explained most of the variation in proportions of species with different floating abilities. We suggest that reach type is a good indicator for predicting the composition of riparian vegetation, especially the proportionate representation of species with various dispersal traits. These results suggest that there is a functional relationship between dispersal traits, channel characteristics, and plant community composition.

AB Recent community studies found no relationship between treefall regime and species richness at the scale of individual treefalls. Here, spatial patterns of trees >5 cm diameter and treefalls (mostly dated by using dendroecological techniques) were described in 6 ha of subtropical montane forest in northwest Argentina, to explore the relationships between treefalls and tree community composition at different spatial scales. Time since gap formation showed spatial autocorrelation at spatial scales smaller than 5000 m(2) (Moran's I coefficient). Point pattern analysis (Ripley's K function),showed that very recent treefalls (1990-1997) are spatially associated with previous treefalls (1978-1987) at scales of 10005000 m(2). At the scale of individual treefalls (100-400 m(2)), species richness was uncorrelated with treefall regime, and shade-tolerant and light-demanding species were not discriminated in a multidimensional scaling ordination analysis. However, correlation between treefalls and species richness, and the discrimination of regeneration groups, increased abruptly at the scales of treefall aggregations. In agreement with previous studies, this study suggests that isolated treefalls have little effect on species composition and diversity, probably due to recruitment limitation. Instead, this study shows that at scales > 1000 m(2), treefall regime is a good predictor of species richness and composition of regeneration groups. This may be because treefall aggregations and gap expansion increase the probability of new nearby treefalls being colonized by light-demanding species. These results emphasize the importance of scale and spatial dynamics of disturbances and species dispersal in the study of canopy disturbances and their effects on community composition and diversity.

AB The potential for long-lasting effects of larval experience on early juvenile stages is growing in recognition as an important aspect of the ecology of organisms with complex life cycles. For marine species, most studies of recruitment have focused on the numbers of settlers that arrive to a site, largely ignoring the potential variability in larval condition or quality and how such variability may influence the likelihood of recruitment success. In this study, I investigated the effect of larval nutritional history on early juvenile performance, and whether these effects are mediated by conditions in the juvenile habitat for the marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. I raised larvae in the laboratory under different food concentrations. Larvae raised with the highest food concentrations were significantly larger in size at metamorphosis and had higher proportional lipid content at metamorphosis than those from lower food concentrations. Half of the newly metamorphosed juveniles were outplanted into intertidal and subtidal habitats for 2 wk. The other half were maintained in the laboratory at two different juvenile rations for up to 20 d. Juveniles raised with high larval food had higher juvenile growth rates and attained larger juvenile sizes than those from lower larval food in all cases. There was a significant positive relationship between size at metamorphosis and juvenile growth for juveniles maintained in the laboratory. Early juvenile growth rates did not change over time (between 10 and 20 d post-metamorphosis). Juveniles raised in higher juvenile rations had elevated growth rates and attained larger final sizes after 20 d than juveniles from low juvenile rations across all sizes at metamorphosis. For juveniles in the field. there was no effect of tidal height on growth for 2 wk post-metamorphosis. Field conditions were more favorable than laboratory conditions for juvenile growth, yet even these more favorable conditions did not compensate for the effects of larval nutritional history on early juvenile growth. Losses of juveniles from both the field and the laboratory were higher for those that had been raised in lower larval food conditions than for those that had been raised in higher larval food, suggesting that vulnerability to early juvenile mortality may also be affected by larval history.

AB Female aspic vipers (Vipera aspis) are "capital breeders," and delay reproduction until they have amassed large energy reserves. Data from an eight-year mark-recapture study on free-ranging vipers suggest that potential costs of reproduction were high for these animals, in terms of survival as well as growth and energy storage. Females that reproduced experienced higher mortality rates than nonreproductive females and, hence, exhibited a tendency toward semelparity, grew less, and devoted most of their energy stores to reproduction. Both the depletion of body reserves and the low Survival of reproductive females translated into significant costs (decrements of lifetime reproductive success [LRS]). However, the cessation of growth during pregnancy had no detectable effect on LRS. Most females produced only a single litter during their lifetimes. A female's "costs" in energy terms were not negatively correlated with her future reproductive output, probably because female vipers vary considerably in the rate at which they can accumulate energy. This notion is supported by the observations that (1) females with higher initial body reserves expended more energy during reproduction, and (2) females that accumulated energy more rapidly after parturition were more likely to survive and to breed again. This kind of variation among females masks any underlying trade-off between current reproductive effort and probable future reproductive success. Despite this complication, a strong link between rates of survival and postreproductive mass recovery suggests that changes in body reserves govern reproductive effort in this species.

AB Organochlorine contaminants (OCs) are a large group of ubiquitous pollutants that have potential as tracers of ecological processes. To examine this utility, we measured OCs, stable isotopes of nitrogen (delta(15)N) and carbon (delta(15)C), and stomach contents in a large Arctic marine fish, the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), collected in the Davis Strait region to examine the feeding ecology of this little Studied elasmobranch. Stable isotopes and OCs were also measured in the turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and stable isotopes in the ringed seal (Phoca hispida) and harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus) to put the shark results in context. Values of WIN suggest that the Greenland shark feeds at a similar trophic level as the turbot and ringed seal (about the fourth trophic level) and at a higher trophic level than harp seals, despite the presence of many turbot and a single ringed seal in the stomach contents of 14 sharks. Values of delta(13)C indicate that source of carbon in turbot and Greenland shark is of a more pelagic origin than in ringed and harp seals. High concentrations of biornagnifying OCs in the sharks compared with the turbot (concentration 10-100X lower) and ringed seals (3-10X lower) suggest that the sharks feed at a higher trophic level than implied by stable isotopes. High urea levels found in the tissues of sharks may influence delta(15)N values, resulting in an underestimate of shark trophic position, and requires additional study. The presence of a ringed seal in the stomach of one shark, relatively high levels of a contaminant metabolite (oxychlordane: slowly formed in fish) in some sharks, and high OC levels suggest that seals may be a common food item of some Greenland sharks. This study shows the utility Of using OCs in ecological study and suggests caution when interpreting stable-isotope data as a single indicator of trophic position.

AB Social Hymenoptera have become key organisms for tests of sex-ratio theory. We assess the role of resources for explaining sex-ratio variation in a highly male-biased population of the ant Formica exsecta. Key predictions of two of the three leading hypotheses invoking an effect of resource availability on sex ratios in social insects are not upheld. One prediction of the multifaceted parental-investment hypothesis is that colonies with greater brood production will rear a greater proportion of their diploid offspring as reproductive females (gynes), rather than workers, This study shows the positive correlation between female-biased sex ratio and the production of brood by female-producing colonies was not the outcome of a trade-off in the production of workers vs. gynes. The main prediction of the constant-female hypothesis is that investment in gynes should be constant. We found extreme variation among colonies in the number of gynes produced. By contrast, all the predictions of the queen-replenishment hypothesis were supported. The queen-replenishment hypothesis predicts that colonies produce gynes only when queen number is so low that colony production of brood is reduced, or colony survival threatened. We found that, as predicted by this hypothesis, female-producing colonies had fewer queens and produced a lower biomass of brood than male-producing colonies. In contrast, male-producing colonies had lower production per queen, and were more likely to be limited by external resources. This suggests that queen number limits production in female-producing colonies. These data provide evidence of adaptive adjustment of resources to worker, gyne, and male brood.

AB In laboratory studies of Arabidopsis thaliana, plants shaded by neighboring vegetation (or subject to treatments mimicking shade) flower at a younger developmental stage, and sometimes earlier in time. We examined whether this shade avoidance response varies among and within natural populations of A. thaliana, and whether it corresponds to variable selection regimes at shaded and unshaded field sites, by conducting a two-year reciprocal transplant study and a parallel greenhouse study that manipulated the presence and timing of shade. In the field, shading had limited or inconsistent impacts on survivorship across several phases of the growing season. The date of bolting was earlier at the shadier site compared to the less shady site, but in the greenhouse there was no significant shade-induced plasticity for this trait. In both studies, we detected directional selection gradients favoring earlier bolting in shade, but gradients favoring earlier bolting were as strong in nonshaded conditions. The number of rosette leaves at bolting (i.e., the developmental stage of flowering) was significantly reduced by shade in both studies. However, there was either no directional selection on this trait, or selection to flower with more rather than fewer leaves. Despite the contrast in habitats, there was limited differentiation between populations for survivorship, reproductive fitness, size-related or flowering time traits, and no differentiation for trait plasticities. Sortie traits were variable among families within populations. A trade-off between age and developmental stage may limit the response to selection for flowering time, possibly explaining limited local adaptation. The adaptive significance of shade-induced flowering time plasticity remains equivocal. Future studies of the plasticity of flowering time in A. thaliana should investigate the effects of shading regimes together with other environmental variables on size- and timing-related traits.

AB Individual growth and size distributions within populations are generally influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors. Positively skewed size distributions may arise as a result of any size-selective process, such as food scarcity or competition. While such patterns have been observed for a variety of terrestrial plant and animal species, size distribution has been less studied for marine fish in the natural environment. This we do in the present paper. In order to investigate the effect of density and environment on juvenile coastal cod (Gadus morhua L.), we assess the length distributions of fish caught at fixed locations along the southern Norwegian Skagerrak coast over the period 1919-1996. We demonstrate that most distributions are skewed to the right, suggesting that competition may influence these systems; such effects seem to be strongest for sheltered stations inside the fjords. Density dependence is inferred as skewness increases with increased density, and the. average length decreases with increased density. The skewness, average length, and abundance of juvenile cod caught in the autumn are shown to be influenced by the meteorological conditions in the spring (i.e., during the larval period). Directional wind stress along the shore and toward the shore and high temperatures create favorable conditions for the development of cod larvae. The effects of local abiotic factors may be measured through the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) Index, a large-scale climatic proxy.

ID TEXAS; VEGETATION; MODEL
AB We assayed the predictability of forest community dynamics by examining the internal structure of a 10-12-yr record of forest change for three sites in cast Texas, USA. Within each site. the growth and fate of all adult tree sterns within many small (0.04 ha) patches have been monitored. These data were reduced to community composition (basal area by species) for each of 28-30 spatially independent patches within each site. We measured predictability of compositional change by the rank correlation of ( I) distances between vectors of initial composition vs. (2) distances between vectors of compositional change. Vectors of compositional change were predictable at two of the three Sites; the third site was an old forest with somewhat high mortality of large adult stems. The data also allowed decomposition of the change vectors into components due to growth, mortality, and adult tree recruitment. Growth vectors were highly predictable from the initial composition, but mortality and adult tree recruitment were not. The results support the idea that growth processes in forests are closely tied to interactions among adjacent trees, whereas recruitment and mortality have components that operate at different spatial or temporal scales and so are empirically decoupled from growth.

AB Natal dispersal is of central interest when determining demography, and genetic structure of populations and managing endangered species with fragmented distributions. However, methodological limitations linked to spatial and temporal constraints have prevented studies of natal dispersal in long-lived birds. Moreover, the consequences of natal dispersal have mainly been related to the first breeding attempt rather than to lifetime reproductive success. We studied the causes and Fitness consequences of natal dispersal in a population of Black Kites at Donana National Park (southern Spain). From 1986 to 1995 we marked 2929 nestlings with plastic numbered bands. We annually monitored marked birds in breeding territories, their breeding success, and the survival of nonbreeding birds. Additionally, we searched for marked birds in broad areas of the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. Median natal dispersal distance was 4.8 km (N = 285), with males more often dispersing shorter distances and females dispersing at all distance categories equally. Density of conspecifics negatively affected dispersal distances of both males and females. In addition, single and first-hatched males born in areas with high breeding density dispersed shorter distances. Dispersal distances tended to be correlated between siblings. possibly a result of sharing similar environmental conditions. We did not find evidence that dispersal was an active mechanism aimed to prevent close inbreeding. Patterns of dispersal in this population are probably driven by intraspecific competition. Males that dispersed shorter distances showed higher lifetime reproductive success (LRS). LRS did not differ among females dispersing different distances, but females that dispersed farther mated with more experienced males. These sex differences in dispersal patterns and their consequences may be explained by the inequality between sexes in breeding roles in this species. Familiarity with the natal area could be important for males, which defend territories and resources, while females may increase their fitness through mate choice and breeding dispersal. High levels of philopatry in Donana National Park may be a result of a surplus of food resources and the effects of conspecific attraction in densely populated areas. However. the degree of philopatry may vary between populations and with time, subject to differences in ecological pressures.

AB Species richness is an important characteristic of ecological communities, but it is difficult to quantify. We report here a thorough inventory of a tropical rain forest ant fauna and use it to evaluate species richness estimators. The study was carried out in similar to1500 ha of lowland rain forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Diverse methods were used, including canopy fogging, Malaise traps, Berlese samples, Winkler samples, baiting, and manual search. Workers of 437 ant species were encountered. The abundance distribution was clearly lognormal, and the distribution emerged from a veil line with each doubling of sampling effort. Three richness estimates were calculated: the area under the fitted lognormal distribution, the asymptote of the Michaelis-Menten equation fit to the species accumulation curve, and the Incidence-based Coverage Estimator (ICE). The performance of the estimators was evaluated with sample-based rarefaction plots. The inventory was nearly complete because the species accumulation curve approached an asymptote, the richness estimates were very close to the observed species richness, and the uniques and duplicates curves were both declining. None of the richness estimators was stable in sample-based rarefaction plots, but regions of stability of estimators occurred. The explanation of rarity is one key to understanding why richness estimates fail. Fifty-one species (12% of the total) were still uniques (known from only one sample) at the end of the inventory. The rarity of 20 of these species was explained by "edge effects": "methodological edge species" (possibly abundant at the site but difficult to sample because of their microhabitat), and "geographic edge species," known to be common in habitats or regions outside of La Selva. Rarity of 31 species remained unexplained. Most of the 51 rare species were known from additional collections outside of La Selva, either in other parts of Costa Rica or in other countries. Only six species were "global uniques," known to date from only one sample on Earth. The study demonstrates that patterns of species occurrence early in an inventory may be inadequate to estimate species richness, but that relatively complete inventories of species-rich arthropod communities are possible if multiple sampling methods and extensive effort are applied.

AB Lupinus lepidus var. lobbii, the earliest plant colonist of primary successional habitats at Mount St. Helens, can dramatically influence successional rates and ecosystem development through N fixation and other facilitative effects. However, 15 yr after the eruption, lupine effects remained localized because high rates of population growth in newly founded patches (lambda = 11.2, 1981-1985) were short lived (lambda = 1.51, 1991-1995), despite widespread habitat availability. To investigate this paradox, I examined 60 colonizing lupine patches. ranging from low-density patches at the edge of the expanding lupine population, to high-density patches in the population core, including 41 patches created in 1992. Survival. reproduction, and herbivory (for a subset of plants and years) were measured on similar to12000 plants for up to 5 yr (1991-1995).
   Stem-boring, leaf-mining, and seed-eating lepidopterans and anthomyiid flies. feeding in edge patches and in low-density margins of core patches, strongly affected edge patch demography, but not that of central core areas. For example, in 1994-1995, 77% of edge plants were afflicted by tortricid stem borers vs. 24% in the core, and from 1993-1995 gelechiid leafminers infested 68% of plants in the youngest edge patches. vs. only 8% at the core. Associated adult mortality was 88%. compared to similar to30% when absent. Seed predators consumed 36% (range 4-92%. 1991-1995) of seeds in both core and edge patches, with seed loss negatively correlated with seedling number the following year. In contrast to edge patches, resource-dependent seedling mortality appears to govern short-term dynamics in high-density core areas. In conclusion, edge region herbivore effects can account for the observed 7.5-fold difference in lambda between patches founded 10 yr apart. Locally, increased lupine mortality creates access to high-quality sites, facilitating succession, but at larger spatial scales diminished population growth is likely to retard facilitation and succession.

AB Competition for pollination has been hypothesized to select for the divergence of floral traits between species and populations. A primary prediction of this hypothesis is that the strength of competition for pollination, mediated by variation in plant abundance, should directly influence the strength of selection on floral traits. To test this prediction., I examined the relationships between multiple components of plant abundance and pollination, reproductive success. and phenotypic selection via female fitness on four floral traits in artificial and natural populations of the hummingbird-pollinated Ipomoposis aggregata. In the artificial arrays, I manipulated the absolute density and interspersion of neighboring I. aggregata and a competitor for pollination (Castilleja linariaefolia). I also measured natural variation in the absolute and relative density of these two species within a 2.5-m radius of focal L aggregata plants in three natural populations.
   The strength of competition for pollination in the L aggregata-C. linariaefolia system was only weakly influenced by local plant abundance. Both the absolute density and interspersion of plants in the arrays significantly influenced at least one component of L aggregata's pollination and reproductive Success. but the effects were not consistent across these components. For example, the treatment groups that received more conspecific pollen were not the same ones that set more seeds/fruit. Within the natural populations. variation in relative and absolute plant density influenced two components of I. aggregata's pollination and reproductive success, but only in one to two populations per component. As would be expected from these inconsistent effects of plant abundance on pollination and reproduction, the strength of selection on floral traits of L aggregata in both the arrays and natural populations was also only weakly dependent on abundance. Previous studies have indicated (1) that self-incompatible species such as I. aggregata should experience strong, abundance-dependent effects on pollination, and (2) that variation in plant abundance at a local scale should have a stronger effect on pollination than variation at a larger spatial scale. In contrast, my results suggest that the effect of plant abundance on pollination cannot be easily predicted from simple diagnostic traits such as breeding system or spatial scale.

AB Plant defense theories predict that allocation to antiherbivore defenses should impose a cost on plants, manifested as a reduction in growth and reproduction. However, the empirical evidence for the existence of such trade-offs is conflicting, suggesting that significant fitness costs of defense arise in some circumstances but not in others. A meta-analysis of 70 studies assessing the relationship between measures of plant defense and growth or reproduction has been conducted to examine the relative importance of several potential sources of variation in the fitness costs of defense. The magnitude of fitness costs varied depending on whether they were measured at the level of phenotype or genotype. The mean magnitude of among-genotype correlations (AGCs) between defense and fitness measures (r = -0.30) was higher than that of among-phenotype correlations (APCs; r = -0.15). Moreover, AGCs tended to be more negative when defense was assessed as the inverse of herbivore densities or damage rather than in terms of single specific chemical or structural traits. The magnitude of APCs was greatly influenced by environmental variation phenotypic costs were lowest under controlled experimental conditions and highest in studies that minimized genetic variation among plants. In addition, the magnitude and sign of APCs varied depending on nutrient availability and the type of defensive compound. APCs were negative at high levels of nutrient availability and for defenses associated with alkaloids and phenolics but tended to be positive at low levels of nutrient availability and for defenses associated with terpenoids. In contrast. the magnitude of fitness costs was not significantly affected by the presence of herbivores. type of plant, type of defense (constitutive, mechanical, or induced). concentrations of defensive compounds. or measure of plant fitness. The above patterns of variation in the magnitude of correlations between defense and fitness measures are inconsistent with the notion that fitness costs are incurred through diversion of common limited resources from growth and reproduction to defense (allocation costs). Instead, the prevalence of significant negative correlations under uncontrolled environmental conditions and their persistence in the presence of herbivores both imply that fitness costs of defense may often arise through interactions between plants and their abiotic and biotic environment (competitors, pollinators, different types of herbivores, their natural enemies, and various types of abiotic stresses). Because the above aspects have usually been excluded in studies aiming at detecting internal allocation trade-offs, the failure to detect costs in some cases may be a consequence of the experimental design. Future studies should examine the relative importance of opportunity and ecological types of costs by manipulating various aspects of plant environment.

AB The pattern of parasitism of the flea species Xenopsylla dipodilli and Nosopsyllus iranus theodori on the desert rodent species Gerbillus dasyurus was studied to test the hypothesis that the relationships between flea abundance and host density conform to pre-existing models of R. M. Anderson and R. M. May, with the correction that the density of those host individuals that possess permanent burrows (residents) is substituted for the overall host density. It was predicted that: (1) the intensity of flea infestation would increase in curvilinear fashion with increase of host density to a plateau that would be attained at a lower level of host density than would be expected from the basic model, and (2) the prevalence of flea infestation plotted against host density would be hump-shaped. The results indicated that intensity of flea infestation increased in either curvilinear fashion to an asymptote (for X. dipodilli) or linearly (for N. i. theodori) with increase of host density. As host density increased, the prevalence of infestation changed either unimodally (X. dipodilli) or logarithmically (N. i. theodori). In addition, there was a positive relationship between the mean number of fleas per host and the percentage of hosts infested. Both basic and corrected models describing the relationships between flea burden and host density fit the observational data well. However. simulations of the fraction of resident hosts demonstrated that this parameter influences the relationship between host density and flea burden only when residents comprise less than or equal to50% of all host individuals.

AB The terrestrial biota of the Antarctic Peninsula region are experiencing marked changes in climate, especially rising temperatures, precipitation, and UV-B radiation-a combination unique worldwide. These changes, combined with the inherent simplicity of terrestrial communities, have led to their use as "model systems" to predict the future climate change responses of biota at lower latitudes. However, studies integrating responses at different levels of the community trophic structure are lacking.
   We report here the consequences on the soil microarthropod community of a four-year, multivariate, climate-manipulation experiment carried out over vegetation near Palmer Station, Anvers Island, western Antarctic Peninsula. The experiment used a multifactorial randomized-block design, deploying filters to raise temperatures and reduce ultraviolet (UV)-B (280-320 nm) or both UV-B and UV-A (320-400 nm) radiation of existing vegetation, with further water and fertilizer amendment treatments.
   Seven microarthropod species recovered in sufficient numbers for statistical analyses showed considerable spatial aggregation independent of treatment, a feature typical of many soil invertebrates. Analyses using negative binomial generalized linear modeling identified further significant and consistent treatment impacts on both individual species and species groups. Relative to controls, manipulations increasing temperature decreased numbers of microarthropods (particularly Collembola), as did exposure to near-ambient levels of UV radiation (separate significant effects for both UV-A and UV-B), while water amendment increased numbers. The impacts of temperature and water are consistent with our understanding of the importance of these two environmental variables and their interaction in Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems. The negative impact of UV (-A or -B) on arthropod heterotroph and detritivore populations in the Antarctic terrestrial food web is likely to be a secondary consequence of UV impact on vegetation characteristics. This is, again, consistent with general predictions of the impact of changing UV climate on ecosystem function.

AB In forested portions of Oregon, species richness of woody plants on plots 400-500 m(2) ranged from 1 to >20. We investigated what might account for this variation using a Satellite-driven process model that predicts gross photosynthesis and establishes, on a monthly time step, the most constraining environmental variable. Independent satellite and ground-based, data confirmed that the highest species richness occurs on sites of intermediate productivity, where 60-70% of the light is intercepted by vegetation. We demonstrated that most photosynthesis takes place during the spring and summer months for both evergreen and deciduous species. We estimated that the spring to summer ratio of gross photosynthesis (APG) varies from <1 to >5 across the state. Both the most productive coastal rainforests and least productive and woodlands exhibited the lowest values of DeltaP(G) near 1, and had lowest species richness. Plots with highest species richness were located in areas with mild, moist, spring weather conditions, followed by a summer drought, with DeltaP(G) averaging above 3. Satellite-derived estimates of gross photosynthesis are available for more extensive analysis.

AB Two major challenges of spatial ecology are understanding the effects of landscape heterogeneity on movement, and translating observations taken at small spatial and temporal scales into expected patterns at greater scales. Using a combination of computer simulations and micro-landscape experiments with Tribolium confusum beetles we found that conventional correlated random walk models with constant parameters severely underestimated spatial spread because organisms changed movement behaviors over time. However, a model incorporating behavioral heterogeneity between individuals, and within individuals over time, was able to account for observed patterns of spread. Our results suggest that the main challenge for scaling up movement patterns resides in the complexities of individual behavior rather than in the spatial structure of the landscape.

AB Theories accounting for the maintenance of high tree diversity in tropical rain forests range from those proposing that tropical trees are highly co-evolved niche specialists, to those proposing that they are mostly generalist, undergoing random drift. We test these hypotheses at a meaningful, community-wide scale using data on the spatial patterns and habitat preferences of all species of Aporosa (Euphorbiaceae) growing on two large rain forest plots in Malaysia. Second-order spatial pattern analyses using a method based on Ripley's K function showed that Aporosa species formed spatially distinct assemblages, and a randomization procedure suggested that these assemblages were explained by biases in their distributions in relation to habitat types. Soil type, as determined by parent material, was an important determinant of habitat preferences, although topography and forest structure also accounted for some variation. We conclude that niche differentiation is an important mechanism contributing to the coexistence of Aporosa species at the community scale. However, spatial separation due to these differential habitat biases accounted for only a portion of the high species richness observed in this genus, so other mechanisms must also be sought to account fully for the maintenance of tropical tree species richness.

AB After a large crown fire in Arizona, we examined the direct and indirect effects of fire and herbivory (and their interaction) on the regeneration of aspen (Populus tremuloides) and arthropod species richness and abundance. We used elk exclosures covering 150 ha and other experiments to examine these interactions. Several major patterns emerged. First, in the absence of elk, there is a positive relationship between burn severity and the regeneration of aspens via asexual reproduction. Specifically, above ground biomass of aspen resprouts was 10 times greater at sites of high burn severity than in sites of intermediate burn severity, and there was virtually no aspen regeneration without fire. Second, elk selectively browsed aspen ramets in high-severity burn sites two times more intensely than aspen ramets in intermediate-severity burn sites, largely negating the enhanced regeneration that would have otherwise occurred, thus resulting in three times greater regeneration in intermediate burn sites than in high burn sites. Third, fire and elk browsing had opposing impacts on an arthropod community composed of 33 taxa from 11 orders and 21 families. Fire severity alone showed no effect on arthropod richness and abundance; however, intermediate-severity fire and moderate levels of elk browsing resulted in 30% greater richness and almost 40% greater abundance. In contrast, high-severity fire and high levels of elk browsing resulted in 69% lower arthropod richness and 72% lower abundance. Fourth, the interaction of fire intensity and selective elk browsing resulted in four arthropod community types where the coverall mosaic produced the greatest diversity. Our study demonstrates that patterns can completely reverse depending on the factors involved. This argues against a reductionist perspective and argues for studies incorporating greater complexity. At the very least, we need to be aware of such biases and consider how they may alter important decisions that affect basic ecological theory and management practices.

AB In an experiment that directly. manipulated grassland plant species richness and composition, decreased plant species richness ("diversity") increased pathogen load (the percentage of leaf area infected by species-specific foliar pathogens across the plant community) in 1998. Pathogen load was almost three times greater in the average monoculture than in the average plot planted with 24 grassland plant species, an approximately natural diversity. Eleven individual diseases increased in severity (percentage of leaf area infected by a single disease) at lower plant species richness, and severity of only one disease was positively correlated with diversity. For 10 of the 11 diseases whose severity was negatively related to diversity, disease severity was positively correlated with host abundance, and in six of these cases, species diversity had no effect on disease severity after controlling for the effects of host abundance. These results suggest that increased abundances of individual host species at lower species diversity increased disease transmission and severity. In 1996 and 1997, similar results for a smaller number of diseases sampled were found in this experiment and another similar one. Although the effect of diversity on disease was highly significant, considerable variance in pathogen load remained among plots of a given diversity level. Much of this residual variance was explained by community characteristics that were a function of the species composition of the communities (the identity of species present vs. those lost). Specifically, communities that lost less disease-prone species had higher pathogen loads; this effect explained more variance in pathogen load than did diversity. Also, communities that lost the species dominant at high diversity had higher pathogen loads, presumably because relaxed competition allowed greater increases in host abundances, but this effect was weak. Among plant species, disease proneness appeared to be determined more by regional than local processes, because it was better correlated with frequency of the plant species' populations across the region than with local abundance or frequency across the state. In total, our results support the hypothesis that decreased species diversity will increase foliar pathogen load if this increases host abundance and, therefore, disease transmission. Additionally, changes in community characteristics determined by species composition will strongly influence pathogen load.

AB We evaluated the hypothesis that recruitment limitation is important in determining density in harvester ant populations. Combining field observations and experiments, we conclude that the population density of Pogonomyrmex occidentalis is largely determined by recruitment limitation, and we demonstrate that variation in population density is a function of the dispersal patterns of foundress queens. The density of established colonies, the number of new colonies, and the number of foundress queens are all highly correlated in this population. The density of foundress queens predicts the density of new colonies in the following year. The density of propagules (foundress queens), new colonies, and established colonies is significantly negatively correlated with the distance from the mating site that is the source of the propagules, and the distance from this source can be used to predict the local density of new and established colonies in this population. Finally, we show that the experimental addition of foundress queens significantly increases the number of new colonies in supplemented vs. control plots. At the landscape level, the population is a mixture of areas with low and high density, with no evidence of overall density dependence. Density dependence is detectable only in local areas that receive sufficient propagules and, thus, depends on the proximity to the source of propagules. Consistent dispersal from a specific geographic site results in variation in population density independent of any variation in habitat quality.

   RESOLUTION
AB Seasonal food webs were constructed for the whole invertebrate assemblage (meio- and macrofauna) inhabiting Broadstone Stream (southeast England). High and uniform taxonomic resolution was applied in a dietary analysis, by resolving the complete benthic community to species, including the meiofauna, protozoa, and algae. Meiofauna accounted for 70% of all species in the summary web and for 73% and 63% of those in the summer/autumn and spring webs, respectively.
   The web structure changed between summer/autumn and winter/spring, due to differences in species composition. Many stream invertebrates fed on meiofauna and organic matter. Addition of meiofauna to the Broadstone web increased the percentage of intermediate species. Seasonal webs contained between 54 (spring 1997) and 86 (autumn 1996) interactive taxa and 229-378 trophic links. Marked differences in web complexity were found between the summer/autumn and winter/spring periods. Meiofauna accounted for most of the links in the web with a high proportion of intermediate-intermediate links in summer and autumn (0.421-0.440) and also of intermediate-basal links during winter and spring (0.509-0.628). In general, the summary web showed that intermediate species and basal resources were numerically dominant components in this stream.
   Web connectance rose slightly between summer (0.052) and winter (0.061) and increased further in spring (0.079), coinciding with a reduction in species number. A high fraction of detritivores was combined with omnivorous predators, many of which supplemented their diets with organic matter and, depending on season, with algae and invertebrate eggs. In addition, a wide range of feeding modes was found among meiofaunal species.
   The diversity of the Broadstone community suggests that the impact of top predators tends to dissipate. A low proportion of top predators in the web was combined with a low mean number of prey items, other than detritus, in their guts (large predators, 1.08-1.26 prey/individual gut; small-sized tanypods, 2.15-2.32 prey/individual gut). Dietary similarity was highest in autumn and winter 1996, and observed feeding links of the most common predatory species showed low overlap in their diets,
   The web architecture of this stream is reticulate and complex, and the patterns observed in these seasonal webs differed from previous stream webs, resulting in low connectance, high linkage density, long food chains, and a high proportion of intermediate species and of intermediate-intermediate links. The food web derived from Broadstone Stream clearly demonstrates that the meiofauna increases web complexity and thus, taking into account their functional diversity, may be crucial to the understanding of food web propel-ties and ecosystems processes in streams.

AB Lake size and depth mediate the strength of interaction between fish and zooplankton. We test whether this variation in zooplanktivory indirectly affects the phytoplankton by comparing 19 lakes that represent two food webs resulting from the absence of piscivores in small, partial-winterkill lakes. Lakes with piscivorous fish are further distinguished by thermal stratification, which provides a refuge for zooplankton to avoid fish predation. We contrasted phytoplankton abundance in these three categories of lakes over six years, using both direct measures of concentration and a growth bioassay that measures phytoplankton from the perspective of a standard grazer (Daphnia). Contrary to expectations, phytoplankton abundance was largely unaffected by trophic structure or the presence of a deep-water refuge. However, grazer growth differed dramatically among the three categories of lakes. Consistent with trophic cascade, increased fish planktivory resulted in more phytoplankton food as measured from the grazer's perspective. This effect was independent of lake productivity or total abundance and size of phytoplankton. Instead, variation in food quality for grazers was associated with compositional differences in phytoplankton, These results indicate that persistent trophic cascades are more dramatic in the plankton than previously realized but primarily influence composition, rather than biomass. Although cryptic, such top-down effects create functional variation in grazer-resource coupling.

AB Two or more species cannot coexist on a single limiting resource in a constant environment unless each species can increase when rare. In this paper, we show, theoretically and empirically, how trade-offs in life history characters have the potential to mitigate the effects of interspecific competition and promote persistence in a host-multiparasitoid interaction. Theoretically, we show how niche partitioning between competing parasitoids can arise through differences in resource breadth and utilization. We demonstrate, empirically, how trade-offs between parasitoid larval competitive ability and wasp life history characters (adult wasp longevity and the ability to paralyze hosts) can be mediated. Differences. not only in the mean, but also in the variance of these life history traits can influence the outcome of competition, and we discuss how species life history trade-offs can promote species coexistence.

AB Data from a 22-yr study of individually marked Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) in a Delaware forest fragment were analyzed to determine temporal and demographic patterns of nesting success, recruitment of local young into the population (fitness), and adult return rates (survival). Clutch size, number of eggs incubated, and number of eggs hatched Were greater in early nests than in late nests, Although no difference existed in the average number of fledglings produced from early and late nests, fledglings from early nests were more likely to be recruited as breeders in the local population. Pairs of yearling (SY) birds produced equal numbers of recruits per nest from early and late nests, whereas pairs of older (greater than or equal to2-yr-old, ASY) birds produced more recruits from early nests. The probability of fledging at least one young tended to be greater for late nests, and the percentage of eggs that eventually fledged was also greater for late nests. All nests were most likely to fail in the laying stage than during any other nest stage, Early nests failed in the laying stage at a greater rate than late nests.
   The number of Wood Thrushes that hatched was the most important demographic, reproductive, or date variable measured that positively influenced seasonal fledging success. Year of breeding also positively influenced success.
   ASY birds returned to breed at higher rates than did SY birds. SY males returned at a higher rate than did SY females. There was no difference in return rates between ASY in ales and ASY females. Producing at least one Wood Thrush fledgling positively influenced the likelihood of return for SY females. Neither annual success nor any other demographic, reproductive, or date variable that we measured influenced the return probabilities of other age or sex classes of adult birds.
   Based on these temporal patterns of fitness and survival, We propose that life history strategies among Wood Thrushes vary as a function of late-season reproductive effort and winter-related factors that affect survival.

AB The stable isotopes of nitrogen (delta(15)N) and carbon (delta(13)C) provide powerful tools for estimating the trophic positions of and carbon flow to consumers in food webs; however, the isotopic signature of a consumer alone is not generally sufficient to infer trophic position or carbon source without an appropriate isotopic baseline. In this paper, I develop and discuss methods for generating an isotopic baseline and evaluate the assumptions required to estimate the trophic position of consumers using stable isotopes in multiple ecosystem studies. I test the ability of two primary consumers, surface-grazing snails and filter-feeding mussels, to capture the spatial and temporal variation at the base of aquatic food webs. I find that snails reflect the isotopic signature of the base of the littoral food web, mussels reflect the isotopic signature of the pelagic food web, and together they provide a good isotopic baseline for estimating trophic position of secondary or higher trophic level consumers in lake ecosystems. Then, using data from 25 north temperate lakes. I evaluate how delta(15)N and delta(13)C of the base of aquatic food webs varies both among lakes and between the littoral and pelagic food webs within lakes. Using data from the literature, I show that the mean trophic fractionation of delta(15)N is 3.4parts per thousand (1 SD = 1parts per thousand) and of delta(13)C is 0.4parts per thousand (1 SD = 1.3parts per thousand), and that both, even though variable, are widely applicable. A sensitivity analysis reveals that estimates of trophic position are very sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of delta(15)N, moderately sensitive to different methods for generating an isotopic baseline, and not sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of delta(13)C when delta(13)C is used to estimate the proportion of nitrogen in a consumer derived from two sources. Finally, I compare my recommendations for generating an isotopic baseline to an alternative model proposed by M. J. Vander Zanden and J. B. Rasmussen. With an appropriate isotopic baseline and an appreciation of the underlying assumptions and model sensitivity, stable isotopes can help answer some of the most difficult questions in food web ecology.

AB In disturbance ecology there is a tension between ecological and evolutionary viewpoints, because while disturbances often cause mortality in populations (an ecological effect), populations may also evolve mechanisms that ameliorate mortality risk (an evolutionary effect). Flash floods cause high mortality in the juvenile aquatic stage of desert stream insects, but these ecological effects may be mitigated by the evolution of life-history strategies that allow the terrestrial adult stage to avoid floods. Life-history theory predicts that, to balance trade-offs between juvenile growth and mortality risk from floods, (1) most individuals should emerge before the peak of the flood season, (2) optimal body size at emergence should decline as flood probability increases, and (3) a second decline in body size at emergence should occur as the reproductive season ends. These predictions were tested with data on body mass at and timing of emergence of the caddisfly Phylloicus aeneus measured in three montane Chihuahuan Desert (Arizona, USA) streams over two years. P. aeneus that had not reached the adult stage were eliminated from site-years that experienced flash floods, suggesting that timing of emergence is an important fitness component. On average 86% of emergence occurred before the long-term (similar to100 yr) mean arrival date of the first seasonal flood, supporting prediction 1. The presence of two consecutive declines in body mass at emergence in most site-years was congruent with predictions 2 and 3. To test whether the two declines were associated with increasing flood probability and end of the reproductive season, respectively, maximum-likelihood methods were used to compare five body-size models: a null model that contains no parameters related to flood regime or reproductive season, a seasonal model that incorporates a reproductive time constraint, and three disturbance models that incorporate both reproductive time constraints and flood dynamics. The disturbance models outperformed the other models, suggesting that at least some of the body-mass pattern was influenced by flood dynamics. The timing of the first flood of the season was the most important determinant of observed emergence patterns. Overall, this study demonstrates that aquatic insects can compensate for flash floods by using state-dependent emergence strategies that are synchronized with long-term flood dynamics.

AB Phytoplankton growth and elemental composition are influenced by a number of factors such as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and nutrient availability. However, little is known about the influence of solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and interactions with nutrients on algal growth processes in situ. We tested the effects of solar radiation and phosphorus supply on algal growth kinetics and elemental composition in two boreal lakes (northwestern Ontario, Canada) during summer 1999. Growth bioassays (at five phosphorus concentrations) assessed changes in algal growth and elemental composition exposed to (1) ultraviolet A [UVA], ultraviolet B [UVB], and photosynthetically active radiation [PAR], (2) UVA and PAR, and (3) PAR only. Growth rates, calculated from changes in seston carbon and chlorophyll, responded strongly to both P and UVR. Results indicated that phytoplankton growth was co-regulated by P limitation and UVR suppression, with highest growth rates found in high P, low UVR treatments. Phytoplankton exposed to both UVA and UVB generally grow more slowly than those exposed to PAR only, even at high P levels. UVB and UVA reduced maximum growth rates by 8-66% and 11-21%, respectively. Phytoplankton growth was more strongly affected by UVB in spring than later in summer, possibly due to shifts in the dominant species present. Manipulations of light and P supply both significantly affected seston C:P ratios. UVR reduced sestonic C:P. Such changes in growth rates and C:P ratios from UVR exposure may have important implications for pelagic food web dynamics.

AB Many plants induce defenses against herbivores following initial attack. Maternal effects associated with herbivory could mediate induced defenses across generations of plants if damaged plants produce more resistant progeny than undamaged plants. I report that wild radish plants (Raphanus raphanistrum) damaged by herbivores (Pieris rapae) or treated with a chemical elicitor of induced resistance (jasmonic acid) during the vegetative growth stage, induced resistance of the plants' progeny compared to controls. Conversely, clipping of leaves with scissors, which results in loss of photosynthetic area but not induced resistance, tended to increase susceptibility of progeny plants to P. rapae compared to controls. Progeny plants exhibited further induced resistance when damaged as seedlings, although maternally induced plants were less inducible than maternal-control plants. Her-bivory in the maternal generation also affected the growth of progeny plants in two ways: (1) seed mass, which was influenced by maternal herbivory, strongly positively correlated with early plant growth; and (2) when seed mass was accounted for, maternal herbivory still had an effect on plant growth, but these effects varied by plant family. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the defensive phenotype of plants is determined, in part, by the maternal environment, and that this allocation can affect the growth trajectories of progeny.

AB Masting increases the efficiency of wind pollination and satiates seed predators, but there is little. evidence that masting facilitates seed dispersal by animals. Masting in pines was studied over three field seasons by simulating seed crops in synchrony (mast years, autumn 1998 and 1999) or out of synchrony (non-mast year, autumn 2000) with the local population. Rodents removed simulated wind-dispersed Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) and sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) seeds significantly more rapidly in mast years than in the non-mast year. Radioisotopes were used to follow the fates of individual pine seeds taken from three source trees. Rodents cached nearly all experimental seeds in mast and non-mast years, making 562 caches in 1998, 510 caches in 1999, and 1034 caches in 2000. Mean dispersal distances of seeds in primary caches were 5.9 and 4.6 m (28.6% and 22.1%) farther in the two mast years than in the non-mast year. Rodents often excavated cached seeds and moved them to new sites (secondary caching). During mast years, some seeds were found in as many as three cache sites, but during the non-mast year, the level of secondary caching approximately tripled, with some seeds being found in five or six separate cache sites. Large seed crops were associated with reduced secondary caching of seeds, reduced seed consumption, and greater seed survival in the following spring. Animal-mediated seed dispersal may be a selective force, along with predator satiation and increased efficiency of wind pollination, driving temporal variation in seed production in some large-seeded pines.

AB The abundance of ectotherms should ultimately be limited by both plant productivity and the radiant energy that makes that productivity accessible. We analyzed a 21-yr data set on ant colony abundance from a North American and grassland site. We tested the hypothesis that seed production and temperature co-limit granivorous ant abundance. We contrasted the responses of the four most common granivorous species and two omnivorous species to rainfall (summer vs. winter) and to an 8-yr seed addition experiment (summer vs. year-round seed additions). The abundance of granivorous ants was positively correlated with summer rainfall, but not winter rainfall, and was 30% higher on plots with summer vs. year-round seed additions. In contrast, the abundance of omnivorous ants was unaffected by either rainfall or the timing of seed additions. These data suggest that both the sign and size of the covariance between monthly temperature and precipitation may affect bottom-up regulation in ectotherms.

AB This study examines the effects of two predatory ants, Myrmica rubra L. and Formica aquilonia Yarr. on the herbivory and growth of two phytochemically different willow species: low-salicylate Salix phylicifolia L. and high-salicylate Salix myrsinifolia Salisb. The net influence of ants on willow growth will depend on a balance between the benefits ants provide to the plant through predation on herbivores and the costs to the plant through the protection of aphids. Using both field observations and experimental manipulations of the densities of ants and tended aphids, I tested the hypothesis that this balance differs between the two willow species. On both observational and experimental willows, I followed the insect densities throughout one growing season and measured leaf damage and willow growth. The results from both data sets suggest that the effects of ants on the herbivory and consequent growth of these willows differ. Especially F. aquilonia had a positive effect on the growth of S. phylicifolia, whereas the effect on S. myrsinifolia was negligible or even slightly negative. These differences can be derived from three factors: (1) the ant-tended aphid Pterocomma salicis L. was very abundant on both willow species; leading to strong negative impact of ants on the willows, (2) S. myrsinifolia harbored lower densities of leaf-chewing insects, which made the positive effect of ants through reduced leaf damage less likely, and (3) the dominant leaf-chewing herbivore on S. myrsinifolia, a leaf beetle Phratora vitellinae L., is chemically defended against predatory ants, being thus less preyed on than the predominating generalist leaf-chewing herbivores on S. phylicifolia. Furthermore, when ants were not-attending aphids, they even facilitated P. vitellinae, apparently by removing other predators. This study provides one explanation for the debate of whether ants benefit or harm plants: differences in herbivore resistance of plants may lead to diverging or even opposite results in tritrophic interactions between plants, their herbivores, and predatory ants.

AB There is increasing evidence that the quality of nutrient-limited algae is suboptimal for zooplankton production. These effects of nutrient limitation are supposed to be important mainly at higher concentrations of food because at lower quantities the overall energetic limitation of body growth should hide the effect of mineral limitations. This has been hypothesized in a variety of papers, but experimental evidence is still weak. In the present study we carried out a set of growth experiments investigating the effect of food quality at very low food levels ranging from 30 mug C/L up to 150 mug C/L. In all of the experiments, the growth rates of Daphnia magna neonates were lower when grown on P-limited Scenedesmus obliquus. This effect disappeared when phosphorus was added to the P-limited algae prior to feeding, indicating that mineral limitation can occur even at very low levels of food.
   Neonates born to mothers raised on either high- or low-P Scenedesmus were analyzed for body mass and lipid content as well as mass-specific phosphorus content to check for possible differential investment into neonates in different environments. Although mass-specific phosphorus content was higher in animals born from mothers grown on high-P algae, when fed low quantities of P-limited algae, growth rates of neonates born under low-P conditions were higher than those of animals born under high-P conditions. This can be explained by an increased body lipid content of low-P neonates, even though there were no differences in neonate body mass between treatments.
   These results illustrate the importance of the incorporation of low food concentrations in ecological stoichiometry models.

AB We examined the effect of frugivorous bats and birds on the population dynamics of the giant columnar cactus Neobuxbaumia tetetzo in the Tehuacan Valley, Mexico. Because successful seedling establishment occurs only beneath the canopies of shrubs and trees, we hypothesized that seed dispersal is a key process in the maintenance of its populations. We determined the dispersal effectiveness of different frugivores, considering the quantity and quality components of seed dispersal. We also evaluated the potential effects of each frugivore species on the finite rate of increase of N. tetetzo populations by modifying the fecundity values of a Lefkovitch matrix model. The bat Leptonycteris curasoae had the highest effectiveness whereas the bird Carpodacus mexicanus had the lowest. The estimated finite rates of increase calculated to evaluate the effects of frugivores on the population dynamics of the cactus differ marginally from unity, except when the effect of the bat L. curasoae was analyzed. Our results suggest that the bat Leptonycteris curasoae could be considered the legitimate dispersal agent of N. tetetzo, dispersing seeds directly to safe sites, and thus representing a key species in the ecology of this columnar cactus.

DE community structure; diversity indices; environmental variance; repeated
   sampling; stochastic simulation
ID MODELS
AB When comparing samples to evaluate changes in community structure, there are several uncertainties that must be taken into consideration. Sampling inevitably induces randomness in observed species composition and abundance. Even if they come from exactly the same community, two samples may show considerable differences. If the sampling effort varies, differences will increase even more. Finally, when time has elapsed between samples, we would like to correct for variations in true species abundance occurring naturally due to fluctuating environmental conditions. In this paper we develop a test method that corrects for sampling in general, as well as for differential sampling efforts. The species abundances are also allowed to vary in time, enabling us to test for additional changes in community structure due to some extraordinary event. The method will be useful when analyzing consequences of human-induced disturbances, such as pollution, but also natural catastrophes, such as fire, flooding, extreme weather, or arrival of new species. Here, our method will be applied to a pair of samples from an insect community. We found that the result was affected by the way we chose to measure the community structure, and that the conclusion depended heavily on the estimate of the environmental variation.

AB Demographic stochasticity is almost universally modeled as sampling variance in a homogeneous population, although it is defined as arising from random variation among individuals, This can lead to serious misestimation of the extinction risk in small populations. Here, we derive analytical expressions showing that the misestimation for each demographic parameter is exactly (in the case of survival.) or approximately (in the case of fecundity) proportional to the among-individual variance in that parameter. We also show why this misestimation depends on systematic variation among individuals, rather than random variation. These results indicate that correctly assessing the importance of demographic stochasticity requires (1) an estimate of the variance in each demographic parameter; (2) information on the qualitative shape (convex or concave) of the mean-variance relationship; and (3) information on the, mechanisms generating among-individual variation. An important consequence is that almost all population viability analyses (PVAS) overestimate the importance of demographic stochasticity and, therefore, the risk of extinction.

AB Despite considerable progress in the study of inducible defenses, our understanding of the role of cues and costs to their ecology and evolution remains limited. This study, focused on inducible defenses in the intertidal snail, Littorina obtusata, in response to the invasive green crab, Carcinus maenas, in the Gulf of Maine. We used widely separated (similar to400 km) snail populations from northern Maine and Massachusetts because they differ in their extent of historical and present-day contact with C. maenas. Crabs are presently more abundant in the southern Gulf and have been there for twice as long (similar to100 yr). We examined whether these geographic differences in contact history and abundance may contribute to geographic differences in risk cue sensitivity, the amount of induced defense, and the scaling of trade-offs accompanying the induced defense,
   Risk cues from both crabs and damaged conspecifics induced the greatest increases in snail shell thickness, whereas exposure to just crab cues induced intermediate levels of thickening. Interestingly, our results suggest that the effects of risk cues are additive and that geographic differentiation in cue sensitivity only occurs in response to crab cues. While northern snails showed greater shell thickness plasticity in response to crab cues, there was no geographic differentiation in sensitivity to cues from damaged conspecifics. We also found that the scaling of trade-offs in body size vs. shell thickness was similar for both regions. This result contrasts with theory because one would expect the more intense selection regime caused by increased crab predation in the southern Gulf to diminish the impact of trade-offs on southern snails. However, this result is consistent with the hypotheses that (1) trade-offs in body size are likely mediated by architectural constraints imposed by the shell and (2) circumventing these constraints via changes in shell shape would likely result in a shell that is more vulnerable to crab predation. Analysis of aperture area and spire height for field populations revealed no geographic differentiation in aperture area, but taller spires in northern snails. Hence, more intense selection via crab predation in the southern Gulf may prevent changes in shell shape that reduce the impact of trade-offs. Finally, despite the large trade-offs accompanying increases in shell thickness, our study suggests that the functional value of increased shell strength in reducing vulnerability to crab predation outweighs these costs.

AB We have experimentally tested under natural conditions the cost and inducibility of thorns in Hormathophylla spinosa (Cruciferae), a shrub heavily damaged by ungulates. We first excluded ungulates from 40 shrubs, 20 in each of two years (1992 and 1998), to test for a negative phenotypic correlation between thorn density and seed production. Next, we removed thorns from 20 protected shrubs to compare seed production in thornless shrubs vs. control plants (also excluded from ungulates). Finally, we monitored the change in thorn production for three years in the 1998 ungulate-exclusion experiment to test whether plants growing in an herbivore-free environment would reduce thorn production. Thorns seem to be phenotypically costly for H. spinosa, since a negative correlation with percent fruit set was found in both years, and thorn removal in the second experiment enhanced seed production. In addition, thorn density significantly decreased from the first to the second and the third years in shrubs excluded from ungulates in the 1998 experiments. These results suggest that thorns,are induced defense in H. spinosa.

AB The latitudinal gradient of species richness is well documented for a variety of taxa in both terrestrial and aquatic environs. Moreover, a number of recent attempts to assess the effects of scale on the relationship have concluded that the latitudinal pattern is scale-invariant. Nonetheless, the power of those approaches is predicated on precise knowledge of the forms of the latitudinal gradient, the area relationship, and their interaction. We used a model developed by J. Pastor, A. Downing, and H. E. Erickson for assessing the effects of scale on the productivity-diversity gradient to avoid such complications. More specifically, for 253 sets of nested quadrats (1000-25000 km(2)) located throughout the New World, we parameterized the power function and determined whether those parameters varied in a systematic fashion with latitude. Significant latitude-induced monotonic variation in the rate of species accumulation with area (z parameter) documented scale-sensitivity for both bats and marsupials, with z decreasing toward tropical latitudes. Variation in the intercept parameter (C) reflected the latitudinal gradient in richness after adjustment for the latitude-specific effects of area. Both bats and marsupials exhibited strong gradients of richness. with modal values in the tropics. Mechanisms affecting species richness. or the size of ranges and the juxtapositioning of their boundaries. may initiate scale-sensitivity in many systems. A number of mechanistic or phenomenological models (environmental, geometric constraint, and Rapoport-rescue hypotheses) thought to produce the latitudinal gradient also enhance the likelihood of scale-sensitivity. Consequently, investigations of other macroecological gradients of richness (e.g., elevation, depth, and productivity) that should be affected by such factors are probably also scale-sensitive.

AB Multi-stage mark-recapture (MSMR) statistics provide the best method for estimating the transition probabilities in matrix population models when individual capture history data are available. In this paper, we improve the method in four major ways. We use a Markov chain formulation of the life cycle to express the likelihood functions in matrix form, which makes numerical calculations simpler. We introduce a method to incorporate capture histories with uncertain stage and sex identifications, which allows the use of capture history data with incomplete information. We introduce a simple function that allows multinomial transition probabilities to be written as functions of covariates (time or environmental factors): Finally, we show how to convert transition probabilities estimated by the MSMR method into a matrix population model. These methods are applied to data on the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis).

AB Insect herbivory is common, but the conditions under which it reduces the fitness and population size of plants remain poorly understood. We quantified population-level impacts of floral herbivory by specialized insects on cobweb thistle (Cirsium occidentale var. occidentale) in a California coastal dune, ecosystem, and then compared these demographic effects to those published for Platte thistle (Cirsium canescens) in similarly designed exclusion experiments in the continental sand dune ecosystem in the Great Plains. As a separate test of the strength of the seed-to-seedling linkage, we quantified seedling establishment rates in seed addition, plots and compared these results to those obtained in herbivore exclusion experiments. This is the first test of direct vs. indirect methods of evaluating the potential impact of seed loss in plant dynamics. Floral herbivory on cobweb thistle in coastal dunes substantially reduced key components of plant fitness. Reduction of insect feeding within flower heads with insecticide increased mean per capita seed production by 144-316% and led to a 130-196% increase in cumulative seedling recruitment in the next generation, depending on dune habitat. Juvenile plant densities around insecticide-treated plants subsequently increased by >50%. Both seed and flower head addition experiments corroborated the seed limitation of recruitment and juvenile plant establishment for cobweb thistle; exclusion of postdispersal seed predators did not substantially alter this relationship. While seed addition results were qualitatively similar to herbivore exclusion results, seed addition overestimated the seed-seedling transition. These results are broadly parallel to those found previously for Platte thistle in continental dunes, where reduction of insect feeding in Platte thistle flower heads increased mean per capita seed production by 37-240%, depending on year and microhabitat. This reduction in seed translated into a 33-580% increase in cumulative seedling recruitment and juvenile plant density. Thus in both systems, insect exclusions demonstrated that floral herbivory limited numbers of seeds and seedlings and population density of juvenile plants. This unique comparison of effects of insect herbivory on plant dynamics suggests that for related plants, the character and outcome of such interactions are likely to be functionally similar in structurally convergent ecosystems.

AB The willow-feeding leaf beetle (Galerucella lineola F) attacks its host plant, tea-leafed willow (Salix phylicifolia L.), heavily in damp habitats, but less so in well-drained soils. To confirm this general observation and to explore the factors affecting habitat and host-plant use by this beetle, we collected data from 12 study sites in Finland during two consecutive years. All sites included three habitats: (1) water, where the willows were growing in permanently waterlogged soils, (2) flood zone, where the willows underwent periods of flooding, and (3) dry zone, where the willows grew in well-drained soils.
   G. lineola was, on average, 16 times more abundant on willows growing directly from water as compared to willows in well-drained soils nearby. To explain this, we proposed three general hypotheses. (1) The food-quality hypothesis states that the apparently stressed willows growing in waterlogged soils provide superior food for the beetles. (2) The predation hypothesis states that open water surface around the willows in wetlands impedes dispersal.. of predators providing enemy-free space for the beetles. (3) The climate hypothesis states that wetlands provide better abiotic conditions for the adults, eggs, or larvae of this leaf beetle. These hypotheses were tested by using observational data and by performing both laboratory and field experiments.
   Contrary to the food-quality hypothesis, adult beetles preferred S. phylicifolia grown in. dry habitats both for food and oviposition medium in the laboratory, and produced fewer eggs when fed on willow leaves from wetlands. Consistently, larvae performed poorly on leaves from wetland willows in the laboratory, most probably due to low water content of the leaves, also rich in phenolic secondary compounds and poor in nitrogen. The densities of crawling predators did not differ between the habitats, and the predation experiments revealed no difference in predation pressure between the habitats. However, during a rainless period, the first-instar larvae performed relatively poorly in drier habitats despite the high quality of food. When ramets of S. phylicifolia were exchanged between the habitats the first-instar larvae performed best in sunny wetland habitats on willows originally from dry sites. Spraying with water improved the performance of neonate larvae more on willows growing in dry habitat than on wetland willows.
   The results show that G. lineola does not attack S. phylicifolia growing in wetlands because of the superior food quality or lower predation pressure, but because of the strong affinity by adult beetles to the moist habitat where also the first-instar larvae, vulnerable to desiccation, usually perform best. An apparently ancestral physiological constraint hinders the beetles from using the best food resources and restricts their occurrence primarily to moist habitat patches with poor quality food and high risk of intraspecific competition.

AB Theories of forest succession predict a close relationship between net biomass increment and catchment nutrient retention. Retention, therefore, is expected to be greatest during aggrading phases of forest succession. In general, studies of this type have compared watershed retention efficiency by monitoring stream nutrient export at the base of the catchment. As such, streams are viewed only as transport systems. Contrary to this view, the nutrient spiraling concept emphasizes transformation and retention of nutrients within stream ecosystems. In this paper, we address how biogeochemical theory developed for forests may apply to lotic ecosystems in the context of catchment-level succession. Using measures of nutrient spiraling to document uptake, we focus on later seral stages by comparing streams draining second-growth (i.e., 75-100-yr stands) and old-growth (i.e., >400 yr) forests of the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA. Standing stocks of large woody debris (LWD) in old-growth streams were orders of magnitude greater than in second-growth streams where logging practices removed LWD from stream channels. Debris dams were also more frequent in old-growth streams. Solute injections were used to quantify retention of dissolved inorganic phosphate (PO4-P), the limiting nutrient in Appalachian streams. Uptake velocities in old-growth streams were significantly greater than in second-growth streams and were closely related to debris dam frequency, LWD volume, and the proportion of fine-grained (<2 mm) sediments present in the stream bed. These data suggest that streams of old-growth forests have greater demand for PO4-P compared to streams draining aggrading second-growth catchments. Finally, we present a schematic model of forest succession, aquatic-terrestrial interaction, and biogeochernical functioning in stream ecosystems emphasizing that the successional time course of retention in lotic ecosystems may be very different than that predicted for forests.

AB A fundamental goal of population ecology is to quantify how spatial and temporal variation in life history traits translates into variation in population-level parameters such as vital rates and projected growth rate (lambda). Further emphasis has been on the sensitivity of lambda to absolute variation (sensitivities) and relative variation (elasticities) in vital rates, because lambda can be related to the evolutionary fitness of a life history phenotype (r = lnlambda). Furthermore, because density regulation can affect the expression and evolution of life history traits, which in turn can feed back on population dynamics, correctly incorporating the relationship between the two is critical to understanding the evolution and evolvability of life history strategies. Here we ask how life history variation affects projected population growth and evolutionary fitness dynamics in the long-term study system of the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata). There are striking differences in the life history traits of guppies that co-occur with two different assemblages of predators and so these populations are a model natural system for examining the fitness consequences of, and selective pressures on, traits that covary predictably. We found that populations experiencing high rates of predation had lower estimates of growth and fitness than did those experiencing low rates of predation (pooled r = 0.02 and 0.17, respectively). But when we incorporated density regulation in low predation sites, observed with field manipulations and modeled with simulations, this difference became negligible. Furthermore, for all populations irrespective of predators, growth rate was most sensitive to changes in neonatal growth and was contributed to maximally by early adult survival. Particularly in light of g-rowing concerns on correctly identifying sensitive life stages in overharvested fauna, addressing these questions in a long-term natural experimental system may provide guidance.

AB Variable seed production may have important consequences for recruitment but is poorly documented for frugivore-dispersed tropical trees. Recruitment limitation may also be a critical spatial process affecting forest dynamics, but it is rarely assessed at the scale of individual trees. Over an 11-yr period, we studied the consequences of variable seed production for initial seedling recruitment in three shade-tolerant tree species (Quararibea asterolepis, Tetragastris panamensis, and Trichilia tuberculata) on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We measured annual seed production for a permanent sample of focal trees and censused annual new seedling establishment within a restricted dispersal neighborhood of each tree. We analyzed temporal and spatial variability in recruitment and compared recruitment limitations among species.
   Annual seed production in Quararibea and Tetragastris fluctuated widely, whereas Trichilia had more, consistent seed production across years. Within species, trees were synchronized in seed production, and synchrony appeared partly influenced by El Nino climatic events. Seedling recruitment varied temporally and spatially. At the population scale, all species had greater recruitment in productive seed years, and individual trees had differing contributions to this temporal pattern. At the focal-tree scale, recruitment patterns differed among species. Quararibea and Tetragastris trees with higher average seed production recruited more seedlings in their local neighborhoods than did less fecund trees. In contrast, Trichilia seedling recruitment did not increase with seed crop size, suggesting negative density dependence. At the tree neighborhood scale, no species showed evidence of density dependence in first-year survival. Comparatively, recruitment was more seed-limited in Quararibea and Tetragastris and more establishment-limited in Trichilia. Overall, our results indicated that: (1) variable seed production influenced seedling recruitment both temporally and spatially, and (2) species differed in limitations to recruitment.

AB Spatial extents of food webs that support stream and river consumers are largely unknown, but such information is essential for basic understanding and management of lotic ecosystems. We used predictable variation in algal delta(13)C with water velocity, and measurements of consumer delta(13)C and delta(15)N to examine carbon flow and trophic structure in food webs of the South Fork Eel River in Northern California. Analyses of delta(13)C showed that the most abundant macroinvertebrate groups (collector-gatherers and scrapers) relied oil algae from local sources within their riffle or shallow pool habitats. In contrast, filter-feeding invertebrates in riffles relied in part on algal production derived from upstream shallow pools. Riffle invertebrate predators also relied in part on consumers of pool-derived algal carbon. One abundant taxon drifting from shallow pools and riffles (baetid mayflies) relied on algal production derived from the habitats from which they dispersed. The trophic linkage from pool algae to riffle invertebrate predators was thus mediated through either predation on pool herbivores dispersing into riffles, or oil filter feeders.
   Algal production in shallow pool habitats dominated the resource base of vertebrate predators in all habitats at the end of the summer. We could not distinguish between the trophic roles of riffle algae and terrestrial detritus, but both carbon sources appeared to play minor roles for vertebrate consumers. In shallow pools, small vertebrates, including three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), roach (Hesperoleucas symmetricus), and rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa), relied on invertebrate prey derived from local pool habitats. During the most productive summer period, growth of all size classes of steelhead and resident rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in all habitats (shallow pools, riffles, and deep unproductive pools) was largely derived from algal production in shallow pools. Preliminary data suggest that the strong role of shallow pool algae in riffle steelhead growth during summer periods was due to drift of pool invertebrates to riffles, rather than movement of riffle trout. Data for delta(15)N showed that resident rainbow trout (25-33 cm standard length) in deep pools preyed upon small size classes of juvenile steelhead that were most often found in riffles or shallow pools. While many invertebrate consumers relied primarily on algal production derived from local habitats, our study shows that growth of top predators in the river is strongly linked to food webs in adjacent habitats. These results suggest a key role for emigration of aquatic prey in determining carbon flow to top predators.

AB Many ecological studies require analysis of collections of estimates. For example, population change is routinely estimated for many species from surveys such as the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), and the species are grouped and used in comparative analyses. We developed a hierarchical model for estimation of group attributes from a collection of estimates of population trend. The model uses information from predefined groups of species to provide a context and to supplement data for individual species; summaries of group attributes are improved by statistical methods that simultaneously analyze collections of trend estimates. The model is Bayesian; trends are treated as random variables rather than fixed parameters. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to fit the model. Standard assessments of population stability cannot distinguish magnitude of trend and statistical significance of trend estimates, but the hierarchical model allows us to legitimately describe the probability that a trend is within given bounds. Thus we define population stability in terms of the probability that the magnitude of population change for a species is less than or equal to a predefined threshold. We applied the model to estimates of trend for 399 species from the BBS to estimate the proportion of species with increasing populations and to identify species with unstable populations. Analyses are presented for the collection of all species and for 12 species groups commonly used in BBS summaries. Overall, we estimated that 49% of species in the BBS have positive trends and 33 species have unstable populations. However, the proportion of species with increasing trends differs among habitat groups, with grassland birds having only 19% of species, with positive trend estimates and wetland birds having 68% of species with positive trend estimates.

AB The invasion of grasslands by woody plants is related to increased heterogeneity in soil resources. At the northern edge of the Great Plains, the amount of heterogeneity in soils reciprocally transplanted between prairie and aspen forest can change within a single growing season, suggesting that heterogeneity is strongly influenced by vegetation. Here we examine several mechanisms by which fine roots could influence soil resource heterogeneity. We measured the total length, spatial pattern, and turnover of fine roots in both prairie and forest using minirhizotrons installed horizontally 10 cm below the soil surface. The total length of fine roots in forest (0.7 cm/cm(2)) was significantly less than that in prairie (1.4 cm/cm(2)), which may contribute to more spatially variable resource uptake in forest. The coefficient of variation of root length was significantly higher in forest (92%) than in prairie (65%). Semivariograms showed that the scale of patchiness of root length was significantly greater in forest (8-12 cm) than in prairie (3-4 cm). Lastly, the rate of fine root turnover was significantly higher in forest (49%) than in prairie (20%). Turnover may contribute to spatial variability because a system with high rates of root turnover would appear to have high spatial variability at any given time. Root mortality was also significantly higher in forest than prairie. In summary, many aspects of root distributions and dynamics were consistent with relatively high heterogeneity in forest soil resources. The greater total root length in prairie may account for the significantly higher intensity of root competition in grasslands than forests and contribute to the exclusion of woody plants from prairies. Trees may be able to overcome this resistance by both causing and benefiting from higher levels and scales of soil resource heterogeneity.

AB Heterodichogamy, that is, dimorphic sex expression of protogynous (stigmas are receptive before pollen is shed) and protandrous (pollen is shed before stigmas are receptive) mating types provides a possible evolutionary pathway to dioecy (dimorphism of males and females) in plant species. I investigated whether the gender of protogynous or protandrous morphs is specialized in male or female function in a population of a heterodichogamous maple, Acer japonicum (Aceraceae), by examining the phenology of sex expression and phenotypic gender in two morphs. Most of the trees in the study (>90%) were bisexual and from either the protogynous (PG) or the protandrous (PA) type The remaining trees (<10%) produced only male flowers over three successive years (NI) or produced only male flowers one year and both male and female flowers in other years (M/ PA). Potential mating opportunity based on the phenology of sex expression was higher between PG and PA type than within these types. Both floral sex allocation and total sex allocation, including investment to fruit development, showed a wider range of variation in PA than in the PG type. But the differences of the means of phenotypic and functional gender between PG and PA were not evident. Floral sex allocation in one year was positively correlated with that in the next year in both PG and PA types. Plant size did not account for the variation in phenotypic gender, which suggests that the size-advantage hypothesis is not applicable to this maple. There were no significant differences between PG and PA in fruit abortion or in seed and pollen germination rates, Although gender specialization was not evident between PG and PA types, large gender variation among individuals in the protandrous type provides a high probability that male plants have derived from protandrous morph.

AB Although both food availability and predation risk have been hypothesized to affect dolphin habitat use and group size, no study has measured both factor's concurrently to determine their relative influences. From 1997 to 1999, we investigated the effect of food availability and tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) predation risk on bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) habitat use and group size in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Food availability was measured by fish trapping, while predation risk was assessed by shark catch rates, acoustic tracks, and Crittercam deployments. Dolphin habitat use was determined using belt transects. The biomass of dolphin prey did not vary seasonally and was significantly greater in shallow habitats than in deeper ones. Tiger sharks were virtually absent during cold months of 1997 and 1998, abundant in warm months of all years, and found at an intermediate density during cold months of 1999. When present, shark density was highest in shallow habitats. Decreased echolocation efficiency in very shallow water and poor visual detection of tiger shark's (camouflaged over seagrass) probably further enhance the riskiness of such habitats, and the relative riskiness of shallow habitats is supported by the observation that dolphins select deep waters in Which to rest. The observed dolphin group sizes were consistent with a food-safety trade-off. Groups were larger in more dangerous shallow habitats and larger during resting than during foraging. Foraging dolphins matched the distribution of their food when sharks were absent. However, during warm months, the distribution of foraging dolphins significantly deviated from that of their food, with fewer dolphins foraging in the productive (but dangerous) shallow habitats than expected on the basis of food alone. When shark density was intermediate, habitat use by foraging dolphins was more similar to the high-shark-density seasons than periods of low shark density. These results suggest that foraging dolphin distributions reflect a trade-off between predation risk, and food availability. Because the distribution and abundance of tiger sharks are influenced by species other than dolphins, the distribution of the tiger sharks' primary prey may indirectly influence dolphin habitat use, suggesting that it is important to consider the community context in studies of habitat use.

AB Coral assemblages are generally open to immigration from regional species pools and thus are regionally enriched rather than saturated with species. Previously we have documented the sensitivity of local richness in these assemblages to a number of regional factors including the size of the regional species pool. Here we focus on the local scale used to determine the local-regional richness relationship. We examine the sensitivity of local richness to regional richness and to two environmental variables (depth and habitat type) across a range of locality Sizes. In general, local richness is sensitive to the environmental variables regardless of locality size. In contrast, it is relatively insensitive to regional richness in very small 1-m(2) quadrats but highly sensitive when sampled with 10-m line transects. Thus our analysis suggests a spatial threshold somewhere below 10 m for the detection of regional enrichment in coral assemblages. There are four biological mechanisms that may allow regional effects to be expressed at this spatial resolution: (1) disturbance and slow recovery toward competitive equilibrium, (2) heterogeneous biological interactions involving aggregated resources, neighborhood competition, or nonrandom dispersal among local neighborhoods, (3) spatially variable predation by specialists, and (4) probabilistic recruitment coupled with equal competitive ability. Empirical tests are now needed to discriminate among these mechanisms.

AB Ant-acacias represent a classic insect-plant mutualism: the ants defend the plant from attack by herbivores, and in return are provided with trophic rewards and living space within swollen thorns. A potential drawback of this and other ant-plant mutualisms is that ant-guards may drive away useful insects, particularly pollinators. We assess the potential for ant-pollinator conflict in a Mexican ant-acacia, Acacia hindsii. This Acacia is guarded by a highly aggressive ant (Pseudomyrmex veneficus), which resides entirely within the host plant canopy and is provided with extrafloral nectar and protein-rich Beltian bodies. Acacia hindsii flowers released their pollen from 0700 to 0830 hours, and were visited by pollinators from 0730 to 1300 hours. Over the same time period ants maintained high activity levels at extrafloral nectaries on young leaves. Although daily activity of ants and pollinators overlapped substantially in time, it was largely separated in space: resources exploited by the ants are predominantly concentrated within new growth, while inflorescences are present only on shoots from the previous year. Ants nevertheless visit extrafloral nectaries on older, leaves near inflorescences, and there is thus potential for ant-pollinator conflict. Bioassays of ant behavior showed young A. hindsii inflorescences induce an avoidance response in its ant-guards, which reinforces spatial segregation between ants and pollinators. This effect,is absent from buds or postreproductive flowers. Young flowers of two non-myrmecophilous Acacia species also induced significant (though less potent) repellent effects, suggesting a general role for ant-repellents in Acacia, with selective enhancement in myrmecophilous species.

AB Spatial subsidies, or inputs of resources from more productive donor habitats, can cause numerical responses in consumer populations via behavioral and demographic mechanisms. In addition, subsidies may have indirect effects on the in situ prey of these consumers. These indirect effects can be either negative (e.g., apparent competition) or positive (e.g., via diet shifts) depending on the relative strength of the predator's functional and numerical responses to prey subsidies. Here we report a numerical response by a lizard (Western fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis) to experimental reductions in the flux of river-derived insects. Initially, equal densities of lizards declined significantly faster in plots in which aquatic insect abundance was reduced by nearly 50% (season average) relative to controls. Abundance and biomass of terrestrial arthropods declined significantly between the start and end of the experiment across treatments. Despite consistently lower lizard abundance in plots with reduced subsidy levels, however, relative declines in the abundance and biomass of in situ terrestrial arthropods (all taxa combined) were not significantly different between reduced- and ambient-subsidy plots. Relative declines in spider biomass differed significantly between treatments and were higher in reduced-subsidy than ambient-subsidy plots, but only over one of three 3-wk sampling intervals. Thus, over the biologically active summer season, aquatic subsidies exerted brief positive or no significant indirect effects on the in situ prey of riparian lizards. These results suggest that, although aquatic insect prey may determine the spatial distribution and local abundance of riparian predators, the effects of increased predator density on in situ prey may be offset by higher per capita predation by these consumers on in situ prey in subsidy-poor relative to subsidy-rich habitats.

AB Self-thinning, the reduction in abundance of a cohort of growing organisms due to competition for limiting resources, has been observed in mobile animals, including many stream-dwelling salmonid fishes. Identifying self-thinning and hypothesizing its causal mechanisms rely on inspection of the slope of the relationship between log body mass and log density. We have examined such relationships for 42 brown trout cohorts (11 yr classes at four sites) sampled bimonthly throughout their complete life span. Trajectories displayed two distinct phases whose transition occurred at a body mass of 30-40 g (14-15 cm). Split lines provided a significantly better fit than straight lines in 32 of 42 cases and explained an average of 81.3% of the variation in trout abundance. The slopes of the first phase typically were not significantly different from zero and were shallower than predictions from either energetic or territorial allometry, whereas those of the second phase were steeper. This pattern strongly suggested that resource availability for brown trout was size-dependent in our study sites. Cohorts did not appear to be self-thinning initially, but resources (presumably pool habitat) seemed to become progressively more limiting as trout grew to lengths exceeding 14-15 cm. Thus, larger size may allow mobile animals to exploit previously inaccessible resources but also may render previously used resources unavailable. Therefore, the relationship between per capita resource availability and body size is likely to depend on local conditions and may not be directly predictable only from scaling the needed amount of food or space with body size.

AB A richly sporophyte-producing population of the dioecious perennial clonal moss Hylocomium splendens was followed for five years in order to investigate the long-term costs of sporophyte production. Female mature segments were divided into two sub-populations: sporophyte producing and reference without sporophytes. Ultimate (long-term) population growth rates of lambda 1.091 and 1.258, respectively, were found for the two subpopulations by building separate deterministic transition matrix models. By bootstrapping each subpopulation, the difference in lambda between subpopulations was found to be significant (P < 0.001). Life-table response experiment analysis attributed the lower population growth rate of the SP subpopulation to inferior ramification rates, lower survival, and inferior size development of mature segments. Considerable variation in H. splendens sporophyte production among years indicates large among-year variation in investment in sexual reproduction, probably related to resource status. Establishment of H. splendens from spores in natural habitats has never been observed. Nevertheless, sexual spores may play a role in establishment of H. splendens populations on new substrates.

AB Mangrove islands in Belize are characterized by a unique switching from nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) limitation to tree growth from shoreline to interior. Fertilization has previously shown that Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) fringe trees (5-6 m tall) growing along the shoreline are N limited; dwarf trees (less than or equal to 1.5 m tall) in the forest interior are P limited; and transition trees (2-4 m tall) are co-limited by both N and P. Growth patterns paralleled a landward decrease in soil flushing by tides and an increase in bioavailable N, but P availability remained consistently low across the gradient. Stable isotopic composition was measured in R. mangle leaves to aid in explaining this nutrient switching pattern and growth variation. Along control transects, leaf delta(15)N decreased from +0.10parts per thousand (fringe) to -5.38parts per thousand (dwarf). The delta(15)N of N-fertilized trees also varied spatially, but the values were consistently more negative (by similar to3parts per thousand) compared to control trees. Spatial variation in 815 N values disappeared when the trees were fertilized with P and values averaged +0.12parts per thousand, similar to that in control fringe trees. Neither variation in source inputs nor microbial fractionation could fully account for the observed patterns in delta(15)N. The results instead suggest that the lower delta(15)N values in transition and dwarf control trees were due to plant fractionation as a consequence of slower growth and lower N demand. P fertilization increased N demand and decreased fractionation. Although leaf delta(13)C was unaffected by fertilization, values increased from fringe (-28.6parts per thousand) to transition (-27.9parts per thousand) to dwarf (-26.4parts per thousand) zones, indicating spatial variation in environmental stresses affecting stomatal conductance or carboxylation. The results thus suggest an interaction of external supply, internal demand, and plant ability to acquire nutrients under different hydro-edaphic conditions that vary across this tree-height gradient. The findings not only aid in understanding mangrove discrimination of nitrogen and carbon isotopes, but also have implications for identifying nutrient loading and other stress conditions in coastal systems dominated by mangroves.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizae are symbiotic associations among glomalean fungi and plant roots that often lead to enhanced water and nutrient uptake and plant growth. We describe experiments to test whether inoculum potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities varies spatially within a broadleaf temperate forest, and also whether there is variability in the effectiveness of AM fungal communities in enhancing seedling growth. Inoculum potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in a temperate broad-leaved forest did not vary significantly among sites. Inoculum potential, measured as the extent to which the roots of red maple seedlings that had been germinated on sterile sand and then transplanted into the forest, were colonized by AM fungi, was similar in floodplain and higher elevation sites. It was as similar under ectomycorrhizal oaks as it was under red maples and other AM tree species. It was also similar among sites with deciduous understory shrubs with arbuscular mycorrhizae (spicebush, Lindera benzoin) and those with evergreen vegetation with ericoid mycorrhizae (mountain laurel, Kalmia latifolia). Where spicebush was the dominant understory shrub, inoculum potential was greater under gaps in the canopy than within the understory. Survivorship of transplanted red maple seedlings varied significantly over sites but was not strongly correlated with measures of inoculum potential.
   In a greenhouse growth experiment, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities obtained from tree roots from the forest had different effects on plant growth. Seedlings inoculated with roots of red maple had twice the leaf area after 10 wk of growth compared to the AM community obtained from roots of southern red oaks. Thus, although there appears to be little heterogeneity in inoculum potential in the forest, there are differences in the effectiveness of different inocula. These effects have the potential to affect tree species diversity in forests by modifying patterns of seedling recruitment.

AB Ecosystem retention of N is mediated by interactions among plant. soil. and microbial processes. These are likely to change with forest ecosystem development as living plant biomass accumulation slows and detrital biomass increases. We investigated linkages among N storage, N cycling processes, and N leaching losses in a study of replicate mid-successional (80-yr-old) and late-successional (uneven-aged old-growth) northern hardwood forests in the western upper peninsula of Michigan, USA. Our study tested hypotheses that detrital biomass and microbial immobilization of N function as larger N sinks and correspond to greater N retention in old-growth compared to maturing second-growth forests. Aboveground living and detrital biomass pools were greater in old-growth compared to second-growth forest, a difference due largely to coarse woody debris (CWD). The total amount of N in detrital pools was significantly greater in old-growth than second-growth forests. We also found more rapid rates of microbial N immobilization in old-growth forests than in second-growth forests. In situ net N mineralization ranged widely among individual stands and did not differ between old- and second-growth forests. Nitrogen (organic + inorganic) leaching did not differ significantly between old-growth and second-growth forests, and was substantially lower than wet deposition inputs. Nitrate leaching losses were significantly related to soil NO3- pools, litterfall N flux, and fine root biomass across both old- and second-growth forest stands. We conclude that CWD and microbial N uptake and turnover are greater N sinks in old-growth than in second-growth forests. This apparent N sink was not the primary factor influencing N leaching loss. however. Patterns of N dynamics among individual forest ecosystems indicate that N losses correspond to net rates of N mineralization and to litterfall N flux (indicators of plant N cycling), which are independent of forest age, biomass pools. and gross N transformations at the successional stages that we compared.

AB Biogeographic theory predicts that intense consumer-prey interactions at low latitudes should select for increased defenses of prey relative. to high latitudes. In salt marshes on the Atlantic coast of the United States, a community,wide pattern exists in which 10 species,of low-latitude plants are less palatable to a diverse suite of herbivores than are high-latitude conspecifics. Examination of proximate plant traits (toughness, palatability of polar and nonpolar extracts, nitrogen content) of high- and low-latitude conspecifics of nine plant species suggested that all these proximate traits had the potential to contribute to latitudinal differences in palatability of some plant species. Southern plants were tougher than northern plants (five species), had less palatable polar extracts (four species), and had lower N content- (six species). Experimental evidence linking traits to latitudinal differences in palatability was strongest for polar extracts and lacking for N content. For one plant species, none of the traits we studied correlated with latitudinal variation in palatability. Because palatability differences may change when moving from fresh plants to freeze-dried plants to plant traits, studies of latitudinal variation in freeze-dried plants or plant traits are likely to under- or overestimate latitudinal variation in palatability of fresh plants: This study has begun to identify the proximate plant traits responsible for latitudinal variation in plant palatability in Atlantic coast salt marshes, but the ultimate evolutionary factors responsible for variation in these traits remain to be determined.

AB Exotic plant species are increasingly becoming the focus of research and have been identified as a component of human-induced global change. Successful invaders may alter soil conditions, but the effect of exotic species on soil microbial communities has not-been studied. We studied two exotic understory plant species (Japanese barberry [Berberis thunbergii] and Japanese stilt grass [Microstegium vimineum]) in hardwood forests in northern New Jersey, USA. We sampled bulk and rhizosphere soils under the two exotic species, as wall as under a co-occurring native species (blueberry [Vaccinium spp.]). We indexed the structure (by measuring phospholipid fatty acid [PLFA] profiles) and function (by measuring enzyme activities and substrate-induced respiration [SIR] profiles) of microbial communities in the sampled soils. Soils under the three species differed in microbial community structure and function. These differences were observed in both the rhizosphere and bulk soil samples. Differences in the structural variables were correlated to differences in the functional variables as demonstrated by canonical correlation analysis. These results indicate that successful exotic invasive species can have profound effects on the microbial community of the soil.

AB Salt marsh ecosystems are maintained by the dominant macrophytes that regulate the elevation of their habitat within a narrow portion of the intertidal zone by accumulating organic matter and trapping inorganic sediment. The long-term stability of these ecosystems is explained by interactions among sea level, land elevation, primary production, and sediment accretion that regulate the elevation of the sediment surface toward an equilibrium with mean sea level. We show here in a salt marsh that this equilibrium is adjusted upward by increased production of the salt marsh macrophyte Spartina alterniflora and downward by an increasing rate of relative sea-level rise (RSLR). Adjustments in marsh surface elevation are slow in comparison to interannual anomalies and long-period cycles of sea level, and this lag in sediment elevation results in significant variation in annual primary productivity. We describe a theoretical model that predicts that the system will be stable against changes in relative mean sea level when surface elevation is greater than what is optimal for primary production. When surface elevation is less than optimal, the system will be unstable. The model predicts that there is an optimal rate of RSLR at which the equilibrium elevation and depth of tidal flooding will be optimal for plant growth However, the optimal rate of RSLR also represents an upper limit because at higher rates of RSLR the plant community cannot sustain an elevation that is within its range of tolerance. For estuaries with high sediment loading, such as those on the southeast coast of the United States, the limiting rate of RSLR was predided to be at most 1.2 cm/yr, which is 3.5 times greater than the current, long-term rate of RSLR.

AB Germination provides many potentially unrecognized sources of variation in the regeneration niche. In this study we relate germination requirements and seed size for 16 species of pioneer trees to microclimatic conditions present in gaps in semi-deciduous rain forest in Panama. We found that, whereas increased duration of direct irradiance can be an effective indicator of the presence of a canopy gap across all scales of canopy openness, diel fluctuations in soil temperature effectively discriminate both understory sites and small gaps (25 m(2)) from larger gaps. Germination response was significantly related to seed size. Small-seeded species (seed mass <2 mg) showed significantly greater germination in response to irradiance of 22.3 mumol.m(-2).s(-1) than in complete darkness. Their germination was unaffected by an increasing magnitude of diel temperature fluctuation up to a species-specific threshold, above which it declined. Large-seeded species (seed mass >2 mg) germinated equally in light and darkness (with one exception) and either showed a positive germination response to an increasing magnitude of temperature fluctuation (four species) or no significant response (four species). The maximum seed burial depth from which seedlings could emerge successfully was strongly positively associated with seed mass. We conclude that photoblastic germination of tropical pioneer trees results in small-seeded species germinating in gaps only when seeds are located in microsites that are suitable for seedling emergence. A positive germination response to increasing temperature fluctuation can stimulate germination of larger-seeded species in larger gaps and when they are buried beneath an opaque soil or litter layer. Therefore, seed size differences constrain the physiological mechanisms of canopy gap detection in tropical pioneer trees and might contribute to observed differences in the distribution of adult plants in relation to canopy gap size.

AB Theory predicts that intraguild consumers such as predators or parasitoids may displace more specialized heterospecific competitors and thereby actually increase the population densities of a shared host or prey. We tested this idea with a native primary parasitoid, Eretmocerus eremicus, and an exotic autoparasitoid Encarsia sophia, both attacking the sweetpotato whitefly Bemisia tabaci. Autoparasitoids are intraguild consumers that attack and kill both the immature stages of hemipteran hosts, such as whiteflies, and heterospecific and conspecific parasitoids.
   In population cages on cotton plants in the field in 1997 and 1998, we introduced whiteflies and then parasitoids in a replacement design with constant total numbers of parasitoids, as follows: (1) control (whiteflies only), (2) E. eremicus only, (3) E. sophia only, and (4) both E. eremicus and E. sophia. Destructive samples of plants were taken 2, 4, and 6 wk after wasp releases, and immature whitefly and wasp stages were censused. In 1997, there were no significant differences in whitefly densities among treatments. In 1998, the control treatment densities were significantly greater than parasitoid treatments, but there was no difference among the parasitoid treatments, indicating equivalent suppression of whitefly populations by the two parasitoid species. In both years, similar patterns in parasitoid dynamics were observed. Densities of E. eremicus were significantly higher in the absence of E. sophia. In contrast, E. sophia densities were unaffected by the presence of E, eremicus. The results suggest that interference by the autoparasitoid reduced primary parasitoid density, but with no concommitant disruption of host suppression. The results support theoretical predictions that no disruption should occur when both parasitoids are equally efficient and suggest that an autoparasitoid may be as efficient as a primary parasitoid in suppressing host densities.

AB Assessing the temporal scale under which gain is maximized is critical for the understanding of diet choice by animals. Classical foraging theory assumes that animals maximize long-term rates. Few studies have considered several temporal scales concurrently, however, weakening tests of rate-maximizing models. We used contingency models based on maximization of short-term vs. long-term energy intake by bison (Bison bison). Model predictions were tested against field observations conducted during six periods of 1998: two periods in the winter, one in the spring, and three in the summer. During most of the year, foraging characteristics and plant attributes suggested that intake rate of bison should be limited by ingestion time over short periods of time, and by digestive constraints over long periods of time. Diet predictions varied across temporal scales for four of the six sampling periods. Selecting Agropyron spp., rather than Carex atherodes, during these periods would result in an increase of daily energy intake by as much as 15 565 kJ (i.e., 7.4% of daily-gains) but would necessitate a longer daily foraging time. We observed, instead. that bison preferred C. atherodes to Agropyron spp., suggesting that patterns of diet selection by bison were more consistent with maximization of short-term than of long-term energy intake. We thus provide some evidence that, contrary to established principles of classic optimality models, the foraging decisions of bison reduce potential long-term gains by maximizing short-term gains.

AB We conducted a factorial field experiment in order to investigate the role of the soil seed bank in gap recolonization in a calcareous Grassland, using 240 experimental Gaps (10 X 10 cm). Experimental manipulations included the elimination of the seed bank (by sterilizing the soil), the elimination of short-distance seed rain by removing all flowerheads in 2 X 2 in plots, and the prevention of lateral clonal spread by surrounding gap soil with 41 pm nylon mesh. The influence of competition on regeneration was also studied, by planting an adult individual of Filipendula vulgaris or Festuca rubra in the center of some gaps.
   There were 130 species of vascular plants in the established vegetation. Twenty-five species also occurred as seedlings; 51 species were recorded in the seed bank, of which only two were not present in the growing vegetation. There were on average 2362 seeds/m(2) in a 10 cm deep soil layer. Species relative abundances in the established vegetation and in the seed bank were not significantly correlated.
   Eighty-four vascular plant species emerged from seeds in the experimental gaps. The seed bank contributed on average 5.4 seedlings per gap, short-distance seed rain (<0.5 m) 4.1 seedlings, and longer distance (>0.5 m) seed rain 2.7 seedlings. Thirty-one vascular plant species arrived in experimental gaps by lateral clonal spread. Of these, only one was not recorded as a seedling in the experimental gaps. There were on average 2.7 clonally spread shoots per gap. Species with smaller seeds were present in significantly greater numbers in the seed bank than in the vegetation and were also more common colonizers of experimental gaps. There was no evidence of competition or facilitation between seedlings, or between seedlings and adults.
   It was concluded that the soil seed bank has an important functional role in a perennial grassland community as a means for population maintenance for many species. Thirty-six percent of the regeneration in small gaps was due to the seed bank, and one may expect that this proportion will increase in larger Gaps.

AB Marine organisms suffer extensive mortality just after settling fro in the plankton, yet. little is known about the role that predators play in causing this mortality. We estimated the rates of predation in the first 24 h, and the first week, after settlement in three species of reef fish. To estimate these rates we compared the accumulation of recent settlers on plots from which predators were excluded (by caging) to settlement on unmanipulated control plots. The magnitude of predation varied greatly among our three focal species, even though they are ecologically similar (all are small gobies that inhabit the reef/sand interface). Within 24 h of settlement, predators apparently killed 92% of settled blackeye gobies. 26% of bridled gobies, and 6% of goldspot gobies. Within a week, predation had significantly reduced recruitment of all three species and was the main cause of death during this period.
   We also tested whether predation on new settlers affected spatial patterns of abundance at two scales. At small scales (areas separated by tens of meters) the distortion of settlement patterns increased as the magnitude of postsettlement predation increased. Blackeye gobies suffered intense, density-dependent, postsettlement predation that completely obscured spatial patterns of settlement and larval supply. Moderate, density-independent predation on bridled gobies only moderately distorted spatial patterns of settlement and larval Supply. Low, density-independent predation on goldspot gobies did not greatly alter patterns of settlement of this species, but unlike the other two species, settlement of goldspot gobies was not correlated with larval supply at small scales. At a larger spatial scale (sites separated by hundreds to thousands of meters), predation failed to distort significantly the input rates of any of the three gobies, and differences between sites in larval supply and settlement were still apparent up to a week after settlement. Overall. our results indicate that predation immediately following settlement can distort spatial patterns of input extremely rapidly, but the degree to which settlement patterns are distorted may be highly species- and scale-dependent.

AB Mismatches between the elemental composition of primary consumers and their food suggest that the production of primary consumers may be limited by food mineral content. Although the consequences of these mismatches for consumers have been studied extensively for zooplankton and terrestrial herbivores, the relationship between periphyton elemental composition and primary consumer performance has been rarely explored. We manipulated periphyton elemental composition by growing stream periphyton under all combinations (2 X 2 factorial) of low and high inorganic N and P and offered low and high quantities to Elimia livescens snails. Periphyton quantity, as measured by ash-free dry mass and total carbon, was kept the same among nutrient treatments within a level of food quantity. We measured Elimia growth as change in blotted wet mass and shell-free ash-free dry mass. Periphyton chemical composition was described by measurements of percentages of C, N, P, ash and chlorophyll a. At low periphyton quantity, Elimia growth on periphyton grown under high P was 40-66% higher than on periphyton grown under low P. Higher P content of the periphyton grown under high P is the most likely explanation for the increased growth of Elimia. At high food quantity, periphyton chemical composition had no effect on Elimia growth. Snails had increased growth when offered more periphyton of lower quality, but generally not when offered an increased quantity of high-quality periphyton. Although snails removed more periphyton when offered a higher quantity of food, snails did not actively compensate for the lower quality food by increasing removal rates when the same amount of each food type was offered. The elemental composition of Elimia was not affected by food quality or quantity, consistent with ecological stoichiometry theory. We suggest that dissolved P was the ultimate cause of differences in Elimia growth at low food quantity, mediated through changes in periphyton chemical composition. Limitation of primary consumer growth by periphyton chemical composition may be widespread in oligotrophic streams, because periphyton production and food quality are typically low.
