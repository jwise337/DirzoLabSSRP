AB Temporal variation of demographic characteristics for animal populations is of interest to both ecologists and biological modelers. The standard deviation of a series of estimated parameter values (e.g., estimated population size) or some function thereof (e.g., log of the estimated parameters) is commonly used as a measure of temporal variability. These measures of temporal variation overestimate the true temporal variation by not accounting for sampling variability inherent to the estimation of unknown population parameters. Using a variance-components approach to partitioning the total variability of an estimated parameter, we demonstrate the ease with which sampling variation can be removed from the observed total variation of parameter estimates. Estimates of temporal variability of survival are given after removal of sampling variation for three bird species: the federally listed Roseate Tern (Sterna dougallii), Black-capped Chickadees (Parus atricapillus), and Mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Sampling variation accounted for the majority of the total variation in the survival estimates for nearly all of the populations studied. Substantial differences in observed significance levels were observed when testing for demographic differences in temporal variation using temporal variance estimates adjusted and unadjusted for sampling variance.

AB The effect of soil pathogens on plant communities was investigated using four old-field perennial plant species and five isolates of a pathogenic oomycete in the genus Pythium. These Pythium strains were isolated from the roots of two of the plant species, Danthonia spicata and Panicum sphaerocarpon, used in a previous experiment on the consequences of changes in the soil community on plant growth. In this previous experiment, Danthonia and Panicum changed the soil community in a manner that reduced their growth relative to that of a third plant species, Anthoxanthum odoratum. In the current experiments, we found that inoculation with Pythium reduced overall plant mass and root:shoot ratios, but Danthonia and Panicum were more susceptible to the presence of Pythium than the other two plant species, Anthoxanthum and Plantago lanceolata. In addition, Pythium accumulates at different rates on different plant species, with a greater than tenfold higher population observed in association with Panicum compared to Anthoxanthum. The results of these experiments suggest that the accumulation of species-specific soil pathogens could account for the previous observation of negative feedback on plant growth through changes in the soil community. As negative feedback may act to maintain plant species diversity within a community, these results suggest that soil pathogens may themselves contribute to the maintenance of plant species diversity.

AB In this paper I seek an explanation for the low level of seed predation recorded for many plant species adapted for ant dispersal by examining the mechanical defense properties of seeds. Mechanical defense of 115 plant species, in the form of seed strength, was measured using two techniques, a Universal Force Tester and pressure applied with forceps. Most species tested had relatively strong seeds (> 20 N), though a significant minority had relatively weak seeds. Preliminary findings of contrasts across independent phylogenetic divergences suggest there was no consistent tendency for seed strength to be greater in species adapted for ant dispersal compared to their relatives that are not. In seed removal assays performed in the field, weaker seeds were more likely to be removed than stronger seeds, whether elaiosomes were present or not. Weaker seeds were also more likely to be eaten than stronger seeds. In laboratory seed predation assays, strong seeds were rarely eaten by two common seed-removing ant species (Rhytidoponera metallica and Pheidole sp. 4). In contrast, species with relatively weak seeds experienced much higher levels of seed predation, up to 100%. In conclusion, the majority of species adapted for ant dispersal produce relatively strong seeds, and this may explain the low level of predation recorded for these species.

AB Evaluating the strength of interactions among species is an important step in understanding the structure of natural communities and predicting how they will respond to changes in the biotic environment. Where feasible, accurate characterization of interaction strength can shift the theory of multispecies communities from identifying the vast range of possibilities to isolating the most likely possibilities. To derive generality in our understanding of interaction strengths, however. they must be placed within a unified framework, a framework that can be applied to empirical situations. In this paper we first identify four different theoretical concepts of interaction strength prevalent in the literature (community matrix, Jacobian matrix, inverse Jacobian, and removal matrix), showing how they are related to each other and how they are derived. We also demonstrate that their behavior is not necessarily concordant; hence it is important to identify clearly which concept of interaction strength is being discussed. Then we evaluate several observational and experimental approaches to estimating interaction strength empirically, highlighting their ties to theory, if any, and the limitations and strengths of each approach. Finally, we apply several techniques to a simulated data set, based on an intertidal community, evaluating both accuracy and logistical ease of these approaches. We find that per capita interaction strength is often the most useful index to measure, that caution must be exercised in interpreting empirical estimates of interaction strength because of equilibrium assumptions and the potential confounding effect of indirect effects, and that concentrating on evaluating the relationship between empirically observed rates of change and species abundances may be a profitable way to proceed.

AB We documented an indirect interaction between beavers (Castor canadensis) and leaf beetles (Chrysomela confluens), mediated by changing plant chemistry of their cottonwood hosts (Populus fremontii X P. angustifolia). Resprout growth arising from the stumps and roots of beaver-cut trees contained twice the level of defensive chemicals as normal juvenile growth. However, rather than being repelled by these defenses, leaf beetles were attracted to resprout growth, resulting in a strong positive association between beavers and beetles. Why? Cottonwoods contain phenolic glycosides, chemicals that are defensive against mammalian herbivores, but are sequestered and used by the beetles for their own defense. Experiments showed that beetles fed resprout growth were better defended against their predators than those fed nonresprout growth. There also may have been a nutritional benefit, because the conversion of the plant's defense, salicin and other phenolic glycosides, to salicylaldehyde releases glucose. Also, resprout growth contained more total nitrogen than did nonresprout growth. Transfer experiments showed that, in apparent response to these increased nutritional benefits, beetles fed resprout growth developed faster and weighed more at maturity.
   Although indirect interactions are much less studied than direct interactions, our work suggests that the indirect interactions resulting from beaver cutting of cottonwoods have important consequences for other organisms and could represent an important component of community structure. The habitat mosaics created by beaver herbivory increase arthropod biodiversity and may benefit other organisms such as birds and mammals. Furthermore, by stimulating the production of resprout growth, beavers may play an important role in the regeneration of a habitat type that is rapidly vanishing in the West.

AB The tiger (Panthera tigris) is an endangered, large felid whose demographic status is poorly known across its distributional range in Asia. Previously applied methods for estimating tiger abundance, using total counts based on tracks, have proved unreliable. Lack of reliable data on tiger densities not only has constrained our ability to understand the ecological factors shaping communities of large, solitary felids, but also has undermined the effective conservation of these animals. In this paper, we describe the use of a field method proposed by Karanth (1995), which combines camera-trap photography, to identify individual tigers, with theoretically well-founded capture-recapture models. We developed a sampling design for camera-trapping and used the approach to estimate tiger population size and density in four representative tiger habitats indifferent parts of India. The field method worked well and provided data suitable for analysis using closed capture-recapture models. The results suggest the potential for applying this methodology to rigorously estimate abundances, survival rates, and other population parameters for tigers and other low-density, secretive animal species in which individuals can be identified based on natural markings.
   Estimated probabilities of photo-capturing tigers present in the study sites ranged from 0.75 to 1.00. Estimated densities of tigers > 1 yr old ranged from 4.1 +/- 1.31 to 16.8 +/- 2.96 tigers/100 km(2) (mean +/- 1 se). Simultaneously, we used line-transect sampling to determine that mean densities of principal tiger prey at these sites ranged from 56.1 to 63.8 ungulates/km(2). Tiger densities appear to be positively associated with prey densities, except at one site influenced by tiger poaching. Our results generally support the prediction that relative abundances of large felid species may be governed primarily by the abundance and structure of their prey communities.

AB Early successional (pioneer) tropical tree species are characterized by a suite of ecophysiological and life history traits; however, little is known of the relationships between these groups of traits, and their consequences for species' distribution patterns in diverse tropical forests. This study investigated leaf-level ecophysiological variation in seedlings of nine sympatric, pioneer tree species of Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae) from Borneo, grown at three light levels (high: similar to 19 mol/d; medium: similar to 7 mol/d; low: similar to 3.6 mol/d). A multivariate analysis of traits associated with species' successional status was used to rank species according to life history variation, and then to investigate patterns of covariation in seedling ecophysiological and life history traits.
   Ecophysiological traits varied significantly among the nine species. On a leaf area basis, dark respiration (R-d-area) in high-light seedlings ranged from 0.51 to 0.90 mu mol CO2. m(-2).s(-1), and light saturated net photosynthesis (A(max)-area) ranged from 7 to 13 mu mol CO2. m(-2).s(-1). A(max)-mass and R-d-mass were strongly negatively correlated with leaf mass per unit area (LMA). Among species, A(max)-mass and R-d-mass were strongly positively correlated for high-light grown seedlings, reflecting a trade-off between high assimilation rates and respiratory costs.
   Within species, A(max)-area, R-d-area, g(s), LMA, and photosynthetic light compensation point were significantly greater in high-light grown plants for all species. Due to the high plasticity of LMA, A(max)-mass and R-d-mass were only weakly influenced by light growth conditions, suggesting that resource allocation patterns that maximize photosynthetic ability are critical to survival and growth in low light for these species.
   Principal components analysis (PCA) of ecophysiological traits for the nine species revealed a continuum of variation from species with relatively low A(max), low g(s), and high LMA to species with the opposite traits. The primary axis of the PCA of life history traits was strongly related to variation in shade tolerance and seed mass. The second life history axis distinguished among the more shade-intolerant species. The PCAs of ecophysiological and life history traits were not completely concordant due to variation in life history traits among high A(max) species. A(max)-mass and LMA, were correlated with a successional ranking of the species. The study shows how a suite of inter-related ecophysiological and life history traits can result in a diversity of pioneer tree ecologies.

AB Few studies have assessed effects of habitat fragmentation on tropical forest dynamics. We describe results from an 18-yr experimental study of the effects of rain forest fragmentation on tree-community dynamics in central Amazonia. Tree communities were assessed in 39 permanent, 1-ha plots in forest fragments of 1, 10, or 100 ha in area, and in 27 plots in nearby continuous forest. Repeated censuses of >56 000 marked trees (greater than or equal to 10 cm diameter at breast height) were used to generate annualized estimates of tree mortality, damage, and turnover in fragmented and continuous forest.
   On average, forest fragments exhibited markedly elevated dynamics, apparently as a result of increased windthrow and microclimatic changes near forest edges. Mean mortality, damage, and turnover rates were much higher within 60 m of edges (4.01, 4.10, and 3.16%, respectively) and moderately higher within 60-100 m of edges (2.40, 1.96, and 2.05%) than in forest interiors (1.27, 1.48, and 1.15%). Less-pronounced changes in mortality and turnover rates were apparently detectable up to similar to 300 m from forest edges. Edge aspect had no significant effect on forest dynamics. Tree mortality and damage rates did not vary significantly with fragment age, suggesting that increased dynamics are not merely transitory effects that occur immediately after fragmentation, while turnover rates increased with age in most (8/9) fragments.
   These findings reveal that fragmentation causes important changes in the dynamics of Amazonian forests, especially within similar to 100 m of habitat edges. A mathematical "core-area model" incorporating these data predicted that edge effects will increase rapidly in importance once fragments fall below similar to 100-400 ha in area, depending on fragment shape. Accelerated dynamics in fragments will alter forest structure, floristic composition, biomass, and microclimate and are likely to exacerbate effects of fragmentation on disturbance-sensitive species.

AB I studied the influence of forest fragmentation on an understory herb, Trillium ovatum, in the Siskiyou Mountains of Oregon, where logging practices over the past 35 yr have created a mosaic of fragments surrounded by clearcuts and tree plantations. The age of trillium plants can be estimated by counting the annual constrictions on their rhizomes. Based on data collected by Whittaker in 1949 (i.e., pre-fragmentation) and a survey I conducted in 1995, I estimated that the process of clearcutting and subsequent conifer planting results in the mortality of almost all trillium (similar to 97.6%). In general, the remaining plants are not recruiting new individuals, even in sites clearcut 30 yr ago. Thus, trillium is restricted to smaller amounts of remnant, uncut forest. My study also demonstrated that populations in forest remnants that were within similar to 65 m of forest-clearcut edges have had almost no recruitment of young plants since the time of the adjacent clearcutting, while forest interior populations contained higher recruitment levels. Projections based on these recruitment estimates indicated that edge populations will decline in size and interior populations will not decline. This study provides the first evidence of demographic changes in plant populations resulting from habitat fragmentation, and it offers evidence for the mechanisms responsible for such demographic changes.

AB The vegetation of the montane and subalpine zones of the Rocky Mountains is a mosaic of conifer forests and large (1 ha to several square kilometers) treeless "parks" dominated by sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), grasses, and forbs. Three hypotheses for the origin of parks are proposed. The "permanent site hypothesis" states that the park-forest vegetation mosaic is a result of differences in physical characteristics of sites. In the "remnant hypothesis" parks are thought to be remnants of Vegetation that was widespread under previous climate conditions. The "replacement hypothesis" states that parks replace forest vegetation in response to disturbance, climate change, or a combination of these two factors. Patterns in the past distribution of park and forest vegetation in the vicinity of Fish Creek Park (elevation 2750 m) were used to test these hypotheses.
   Fossil pollen extracted from the sediments of live small ponds in and around Fish Creek Park was used to reconstruct Holocene vegetation changes. Changes in vegetation were reconstructed through the use of multivariate analyses and pollen ratios derived from modern surface samples and by comparison with pollen data from other studies. The pollen record indicates that shortly after deglaciation (similar to 11000 yr BP) the area supported alpine tundra, followed by whitebark pine-spruce-fir parkland at similar to 9500 yr BP. From similar to 8500 to 6000 yr BP, a pine parkland occupied the area, perhaps in response to climate conditions warmer than today. By 5000 yr BP a mixed pine-spruce-fir forest resembling the modern subalpine forest near Fish Creek Park probably replaced the pine parkland at ail five sites. The modern Dark vegetation originated only within the last similar to 2500 yr.
   The conversion to park Vegetation may not have been synchronous at all three sites, and the replacement of forest by park did not always result in a long-term conversion to park vegetation. The timing and pattern of changes in the vegetation mosaic eliminate the permanent site and remnant hypotheses and suggest instead that climatic cooling over the last several thousand years, possibly combined with removal of forest cover by fire or some other disturbance, could explain the origin of Fish Creek Park.

AB In some situations, survey counts must be adjusted for the effects of concomitant variables using analysis of covariance in order to detect a trend in abundance over time. A power analysis in these cases allows the calculation of the probability of detecting a trend after adjustments. The methods will be applicable to samples taken at regular or irregular intervals in time or space, and in which the effects of the concomitant variables do not change over time. Furthermore, the detection of linear and intrinsically linear change can be determined. The methods are applied to the monitoring of American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) populations in Florida.

AB We examined stand disturbance history, population structures, spatial relationships of age classes and size classes, and tree growth histories in an old-growth temperate rain forest in southern New Zealand. We aimed to determine the role of juvenile and adult life history differences in promoting coexistence of the four main overstory species (Nothofagus menziesii, Weinmannia racemosa, Dacrydium cupressinum, and Prumnopitys ferruginea).
   There was no evidence that major compositional shifts were occurring: N. menziesii, D. cupressinum, and P. ferruginea were represented by all-aged populations, indicating continual recruitment of all three species within the 5-ha study area during recent centuries. No age data were obtained for W. racemosa, but the diameter distribution of this species was consistent with an all-aged population structure. The temporal distribution of releases in tree ring sequences suggested a history of chronic patchy disturbance during at least the last 400 years. Ring width sequences were consistent with species differences in growth histories. About half (53%) of N. menziesii >20 cm dbh appeared to have reached the canopy in one growth spurt, compared to only 11% of P. ferruginea. Many trees of the latter species showed multiple episodes of release and suppression, indicating successive responses to several gap events before reaching the canopy. D. cupressinum growth histories were intermediate between these two extremes.
   Nearest neighbor age relationships also indicated species differences in regeneration patterns. Neighboring individuals of N. menziesii greater than or equal to 10 cm dbh were, on average, significantly more similar in age than random pairs drawn from the age data pool under a bootstrap null model. This pattern is consistent with regeneration of N. menziesii in small, even-aged patches, in response to treefall gaps. In contrast, age differences between nearest neighbor pairs of P. ferruginea and D. cupressinum trees did not deviate significantly from the null model of randomly selected ages, suggesting that establishment and survival were not closely linked to gap formation.
   Maximum radial growth rates of N. menziesii saplings were nearly 2.5 times those of D. cupressinum and P. ferruginea. Fast growth of N. menziesii beneath treefall gaps may compensate for the greater shade tolerance of P. ferruginea, in particular. D. cupressinum, although apparently outperformed by one or another of its competitors in both shade and treefall gaps, has a longer life-span than any of the other species. Thus, relatively low recruitment rates may be sufficient to maintain its present abundance. Fewer data were available for W. racemosa, but its ability to reproduce vegetatively may be an important factor in its persistence in competition with the other dominants.
   Under a disturbance regime dominated by treefall gaps, coexistence of the four dominants appears to be associated with complementary differences in growth rate, shade tolerance, canopy residence time, and facility for vegetative reproduction. Our results serve to emphasize that understanding plant species coexistence may require attention to interspecific differences in both juvenile and adult life history characteristics.

AB We use simple mathematical models to explore the indirect interactions between two prey species that share a predator when all three species undergo population cycles. The results are compared to analogous findings for systems that reach a stable equilibrium point. It is common for removal of one prey from a cycling system to result in a decrease in the mean density of the remaining prey species, contrary to the usual logic of apparent competition. Even when apparent competition between prey exists, its magnitude is usually reduced by population cycles. This effect occurs when the predator has a concave-down relationship between prey abundance and its own per capita growth rate. Such relationships can occur because of a saturating functional or numerical response. We investigate how prey density dependence and the shape of the predator's functional and numerical responses affect the sign and magnitude of this indirect interaction between prey species. There may also be (+, -) interactions between prey that differ significantly in their susceptibility to the common predator.

AB Generalized parasites may strongly influence host communities by differentially impacting host species. However, the community effects of an important and widespread group of generalized parasites, the parasitic plants, have been poorly studied. I performed removal experiments to assess the role of a small annual hemiparasite, Triphysaria pusilla (Scrophulariaceae), in a California coastal prairie community.
   Removal of Triphysaria led to increased total biomass of the host assemblage; this effect was largely attributable to a substantial increase in the biomass of graminoids. In addition, host suitability differed dramatically among three annual taxa: Triphysaria parasitizing grass hosts produced 3.2 and 6.4 times more fruits, on average, than those attacking two dicot hosts, Hypochaeris glabra and Lupinus nanus, respectively. Availability of multiple host species failed to improve parasite performance beyond that achieved on grasses alone. Triphysaria impacts also differed greatly among host species: natural densities of Triphysaria significantly reduced the dry mass of grasses, while Hypochaeris and Lupinus were unharmed.
   In addition to these direct effects, I tested whether Triphysaria attack influenced competitive interactions among host taxa. Natural densities of grasses significantly reduced growth and fecundity of Hypochaeris and Lupinus, suggesting that the presence of Triphysaria in mixed stands of hosts might allow competitive release of these dicot species. However, the combination of grasses and Triphysaria caused a more severe reduction in Lupinus performance than that caused by grasses alone. Thus, observations of direct effects among pairs of species were not sufficient to explain either the outcome or intensity of multi-species interactions. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that a generalist plant parasite can influence the structure of a natural plant community, and that interactions between a generalist parasite and its multiple host species can be difficult to predict from studies that consider only single host taxa.

AB We investigated the roles of habitat fragmentation and the invasion of an exotic species on the structure of ground-foraging ant communities in 40 scrub habitat fragments in coastal southern California. In particular, we asked: how do fragment age, fragment size, amount of urban edge, percentage of native vegetation, degree of isolation, and the relative abundance of an exotic species, the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) affect native ants? Within these fragments, Argentine ants were more abundant near developed edges and in areas dominated by exotic vegetation. The number of native ground-foraging ant species at any point declined from an average of >7 to <2 species in the presence of the Argentine ant. Among fragments, a stepwise multiple regression revealed that the abundance of Argentine ants, the size of the fragment, and the number of years since it was isolated from larger continuous areas of scrub habitat best predict the number of remaining native ant species. The Argentine ant was found in every fragment surveyed as well as around the edges of larger unfragmented areas. Fragments had fewer native ant species than similar-sized plots within large unfragmented areas, and fragments with Argentine ant-free refugia had more native ant species than those without refugia. The relative vulnerability of native ants to habitat fragmentation and the subsequent presence of Argentine ants vary among species. The most sensitive species include army ants (Neivamyrmex spp.) and harvester ants (genera Messor and Pogonomyrmex), both of which are important to ecosystem-level processes. Our surveys suggest that the Argentine ant is widespread in fragmented coastal scrub habitats in southern California and strongly affects native ant communities.

AB Flows of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in throughfall and soil solutions in forest ecosystems vary spatially and temporally. However, the reasons for the variability of DOC flows are unknown. Phytophagous insects such as aphids have not been considered a potential source of organic carbon, even though aphids feeding on trees excrete copious amounts of honeydew. We followed the key processes determining the origin, flow, and path of honeydew from the phyllosphere of a Norway spruce stand to the soil. We analyzed the chemical composition of needle leachates, throughfall, and soil solution to calculate fluxes of DOC and hexose-C in an aphid-infested and an uninfested Norway spruce stand.
   At the individual aphid level, the amount of honeydew produced was dependent on temperature, developmental stage, and the nutritional status of spruce. At the population level, colony growth and natural enemies influenced the amount of honeydew available in the phyllosphere. The growth rates of microorganisms on spruce needles were significantly increased when honeydew was available.
   This study of the fate of honeydew and associated metabolites within a forest stand shows that the concentrations of DOC and hexose-C in throughfall were reduced on the way to the soil and that there were no differences in the soil solutions from infested and uninfested stands. However, the distribution and abundance of honeydew-producing Homoptera had a marked effect on the spatial and temporal variability in the DOC concentrations in throughfall. High DOC concentrations in throughfall during summer are not exclusively due to the leaching of nutrients from leaves, but may also be attributed to the excreta of aphids.
   Our results highlight the importance of studying physiological and life history processes in addition to taking the traditional biomass approach to ecosystem studies. We discuss our results with regard to the types of information that are preserved, transformed, or lost when crossing the conceptual border between one scale of observation and another. We emphasize the importance of identifying key processes at different spatiotemporal scales by linking the biology of individuals and populations with flows of energy and matter within an ecosystem, while stressing the need to identify ecosystem changes at different scales of observation.

AB Many species change diets during development. Often, these ontogenetic changes are discrete and coincide with metamorphosis (e.g., amphibians), but more gradual niche changes can occur during growth. Identifying nondiscrete changes in diet and understanding their implications at the population and community levels are especially difficult for ecologists who study detritivores and other species that have poorly characterized diets. Theory and several lines of evidence suggest, however, that benthic juveniles of species that deposit feed as adults may be unable to meet their nutritional demands by deposit feeding. To reject the null hypothesis that both juveniles and adults of deposit-feeding species assimilate the same diet and to infer ontogenetic changes in diet, I used stable carbon isotopes as a natural diet tracer. I quantified body-size-dependent variations in the delta(13)C of four species of tentaculate, surface-deposit-feeding polychaetes: the ampharetid Hobsonia florida and the spionids Pseudopolydora kempi japonica, Polydora cornuta, and Pygospio elegans. In addition to worm tissues, I measured the isotopic compositions of the most likely primary producers at each field site (benthic diatoms, macroalgae, and saltmarsh grasses) to predict the worms' carbon sources.
   All species showed significant size-dependent variations in delta(13)C. Furthermore, populations of P. kempi japonica at two different sandflats had similar ontogenetic trends despite isotopic differences in available foods at each site. Individuals fed a fixed diet in the laboratory, however, did not show significant size-dependent variation in delta(13)C, leaving ontogenetic changes in diet as the most parsimonious explanation of the field data. Regression analyses indicated that the gradual change in delta(13)C(= with body size was nonlinear, with most of the change in delta(13)C occurring before individuals reach sexual maturity. The complex life cycle of these species, therefore, includes both a radical change in niche when larvae metamorphose to juveniles and a gradual niche shift as benthic juveniles grow. The isotopic data indicate that the smallest juveniles assimilated much of their carbon from benthic diatoms (delta(13)C approximate to -20 parts per thousand), while adults assimilated most of their carbon from detritus derived from macroalgae (delta(13)C approximate to -9 parts per thousand) or saltmarsh grasses (delta(13)C approximate to -14 parts per thousand). Because abundances of benthic diatoms or other high-quality components of sediment are more variable and more likely to be in limiting supply than detritus or bulk sedimentary organics, populations of species that deposit feed as adults may experience food-related recruitment bottlenecks during the juvenile stage.

AB This study identifies patterns in the gap disturbance regime along a successional gradient in the southern boreal forest and uses this information to investigate canopy composition changes. Gaps were characterized in hardwood, mixed-forest, and conifer stands surrounding Lake Duparquet in northwestern Quebec. From 39 to 80 gaps were evaluated along transects established in each of these stands. The abundance of gap makers and gap fillers and total regeneration was evaluated by species, as well as the size of each gap encountered along the transects. The percentage of the forest in canopy gap was calculated directly from the proportion of the transect in gap and by using gap area and line-intercept techniques. Changes in composition were evaluated from gap-maker and gap-filler distributions and by using transition matrices based on species mortality and regeneration in canopy gaps.
   The percentage of the forest in canopy gap ranges from 7.1% in a 50-yr-old forest dominated primarily by aspen to 40.4% in a 234-yr-old fir-dominated forest. Gap events are due to individual or small-group tree mortality in the early successional forest but become species-specific events controlled by spruce budworm outbreaks in the later stages of succession. Due to the high latitude, direct light only reaches the forest floor in the very largest gaps of the conifer-dominated stands. However, these gaps form slowly as budworm-caused mortality occurs over a number of years, whereas in aspen-dominated stands gaps are formed quickly by the snapping of tree stems. Balsam fir is the most abundant gap-filling species; however, its abundance is negatively correlated to gap size in all stand types. Markovian transition matrices suggest that in the young aspen-dominated forests small gaps lead to species replacment by more shade-tolerant conifers but that in the oldest forests the larger gaps will result in maintenance of the intolerant species and an increase in the abundance of cedar.

AB Tree mortality is a critical attribute of forest ecosystems. But the factors responsible for tree mortality are ,poorly understood, particularly for trees in relatively healthy forests. I evaluated a conceptual model of the tree-mortality process that attributes tree death to a sequence of environmental stresses: long-term stresses that predispose trees to injury by short-term, inciting stresses. Tree-ring growth data from 63 dead overstory oaks (Quercus spp. L.) from seven Midwestern (USA) oak-hickory forests were employed as long-term records of tree vigor. Tree-ring growth data from surviving oaks from the same sites were utilized for comparison and as an indicator of year-to-year variations in environmental stress at each site. Utilizing time-series regression analysis, evidence of the action of inciting stresses was sought in the form of sudden and permanent declines, or interventions, in individual tree growth rates coincident with environmental stresses. Utilizing hierarchical regression analysis, evidence of the action of the predisposing stresses was sought in the form of reduced growth rates prior to the interventions. Three-fourths of the dead trees had growth patterns prior to mortality that included growth declines indicative of inciting stress. The median intervention resulted in a 38% decline in basal-area growth rate. The interventions were more likely to occur during environmentally stressful years, with five drought years accounting for 40% of the interventions experienced by the dead trees. Prior to experiencing interventions, the now-dead trees were growing an average of 18% slower than comparable surviving trees, indicating the action of predisposing stresses. After interventions occurred, two decades typically passed before the trees died. The results indicate that, for oaks in the forests studied, tree mortality is usually a decades-long process involving a combination of environmental stresses. The observed mortality process provides a framework for identifying the causes of tree mortality but suggests limits on the utility of tree mortality as an indicator of forest response to specific environmental stresses.

AB The shape of the function that describes the relationship between resource allocation to sperm production and resulting male fertilization success (the male gain curve) plays a central role in models of sex allocation in hermaphrodites. A variety of ecological factors are expected to affect the shape of this function. Although male gain curves and male allocation patterns have been assayed in a variety of different organisms, there have been few attempts to determine whether the shape of the gain curve changes with ecological conditions. I assayed male gain curves in experimental populations of a colonial ascidian in which I manipulated the intensity of sperm competition to test the hypothesis that gain curves would saturate in the absence of competitors, but remain linear when males competed for fertilizations. Allozyme markers were utilized for paternity assignment. Results supported theoretical predictions, with the gain curve becoming progressively more linear as the intensity of sperm competition increased. Increased levels of sperm competition also had the: effect of decreasing male fertilization success at all sperm production levels. These results have a number of evolutionary implications. First, the existence of a saturating gain curve under some experimental conditions provides support for the hypothesis that diminishing gains in fertilization success via male function may favor the evolution of hermaphroditism. Secondly, the changing shape of this function with ecological conditions suggests that increased allocation to sperm production should be favored in high-density populations, where sperm competition is more intense. Finally, since male fertilization success only continued to increase with sperm production when competitors were present, this suggests that high levels of sperm production in some free-spawning marine invertebrates may be in part due to the selective pressures imposed on allocation patterns by sperm competition.

AB Species composition of temperate forests vary with successional age (i.e., years after a major disturbance) and seems likely to change in response to significant global climate change. Because photosynthesis rates in co-occurring tree species can differ in their sensitivity to environmental conditions, these changes in species composition are likely to alter the carbon dynamics of temperate forests. To help improve our understanding of such atmosphere-biosphere interactions, we explored changes in leaf-level photosynthesis in a 60-70 yr old temperate mixed-deciduous forest in Petersham, Massachusetts (USA).
   Diurnally and seasonally varying environmental conditions differentially influenced. in situ leaf-level photosynthesis rates in the canopies of four mature temperate deciduous tree species: red oak (Quercus rubra), red maple (Acer rubrum), white birch (Betula papyrifera), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis). We measured in situ photosynthesis at two heights within the canopies (top of the canopy at similar to 20 m, and in the sub-canopy of the same individual trees at similar to 14-16 m) through a diurnal time course on 7 d over two growing seasons. We simultaneously measured a suite of environmental conditions surrounding the leaf at the time of each measurement. We used path analysis to examine the influence of environmental factors on insitu photosynthesis in the tree canopies.
   Overall, red oak had the highest photosynthesis rates, followed by white birch, yellow birch, and red maple. There was little evidence for a substantial midday depression in photosynthesis. Instead, photosynthesis declined throughout the day, particularly after 1600. Diurnal patterns of light reaching canopy leaves, leaf and air temperature, and Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) contributed to diurnally varying photosynthesis rates. Large differences in these parameters through the growing season partly led to the seasonal differences observed in photosynthesis rates. Path analyses helped to identify the relative contribution of various environmental factors on photosynthesis and further revealed that species-specific sensitivities to various environmental conditions shifted through the season. Red oak photosynthesis was particularly sensitive to air temperatures late in the season when air temperatures were low. Further, red maple photosynthesis was particularly sensitive to high VPDs through the growing season.
   Incorporating data on the physiological differences among tree species into forest carbon models will greatly improve our ability to predict alterations to the forest carbon budgets under various environmental scenarios such as global climate change, or with differing species composition.

AB Understanding evolutionary consequences of intermittent breeding (nonbreeding in individuals that previously bred) requires investigation of the relationships between adult breeding state and two demographic parameters: survival probability and subsequent breeding probability. One major difficulty raised by comparing the demographic features of breeders and nonbreeders as estimated from capture-recapture data is that breeding state is often suspected to influence recapture or resighting probability. We used multistate capture-recapture models to test the hypothesis of equal recapture probabilities for breeding and nonbreeding Kittiwakes and found no evidence of an effect of breeding state on this parameter. The same method was used to test whether reproductive state affects survival probability. Nonbreeding individuals have lower survival rates than breeders. Moreover, nonbreeders have a higher probability of being nonbreeders the following year than do breeders. State-specific survival rates and transition probabilities vary from year to year, but temporal variations of survival and transition probabilities of breeders and nonbreeders are in parallel (on a legit scale). These inferences led us to conclude that nonbreeders tend to be lower quality individuals. The effect of sex was also investigated: males and females do not differ with respect to survival probabilities when reproductive state is taken into account. Similarly, there is no effect of sex on transition probabilities between reproductive states.

AB Flying foxes of the genus Pteropus (Pteropodidae: Chiroptera) play important roles as pollinators and seed dispersers in oceanic-island forest communities. This research examined general theories of diet breadth, diet selection, and the evolution of feeding strategies in bats in light of information from members of the genus Pteropus that inhabit oceanic islands. The feeding ecology of two species of flying fox, Pteropus samoensis and Pteropus tonganus on the Samoan archipelago, was examined in detail by direct observation and by examining feeding refuse. P. samoensis and P. tonganus fed on over 78 plant species from 39 families throughout their range and on over 69 plant species in Samoa alone. Flying foxes interacted with 59% of the forest tree species in Amalau Valley for fruit or flower resources. Twenty-eight percent of the forest trees were commonly used, and 79% of forest canopy trees were used. Broad overlap in resource use was noted between P. samoensis and P. tonganus with over 22 shared plant species. Seasonal variation in fruit resource use was quantified with a preference index. Flying foxes ate a taxonomically nonrandom subset of fruit species and generally preferred primary forest fruits to those in the secondary forest. Six plant families (Sapotaceae, Mrytaceae, Moraceae, Combretaceae, Fabaceae, and Sapindaceae) were particularly important to flying foxes in Samoa. However, a set of core plant taxa does not exist for Pteropus spp, in Samoa. Differences in the evolution of feeding strategies between mainland fruit-eating chiroptera and island species likely reflect differences in the spatio-temporal availability of resources in the two systems.

AB We examined rates of C, N, and P mineralization in soils from 16 northern Minnesota wetlands that occur across an ombrotrophic-minerotrophic gradient. Soils were incubated at 30 degrees C under aerobic and anaerobic conditions for 59 wk, and the results were fit with a two-pool kinetic model. Additionally, 39 different soil quality variables were used in a principal components analysis (PCA) to predict mineralization rates.
   Mineralization of C, N, and P differed significantly among wetland types, aeration status (aerobic vs. anaerobic), and their interaction term. Despite low total soil N and P, there was a rapid turnover of the nutrient pools in ombrotrophic sites, particularly under aerobic conditions. On a volumetric basis, C and N mineralization increased in a predictable manner across the ombrotrophic-minerotrophic gradient, largely due to increasing soil bulk density. However, P mineralization per cubic centimeter remained relatively high in the bogs. The higher total P content of more minerotrophic soils appears to be offset by greater P immobilization due to geochemical sorption, yielding overall lower availability.
   Total C turnover rates were relatively similar among sites, despite large differences in soil quality. We suggest that, over time, the decay rates of organic matter in different wetland communities converge to a common rate. In contrast, CH(4) production was extremely low in ombrotrophic pests.
   The apparent labile pools of N (N(0)), P (P(0)), and C (C(0)) were generally <10% of their respective total pool sizes, except for P(0) in the bogs, which constituted up to 33% of total soil P. From 10% to 87% of the N, P, and C mineralized after 59 wk was derived from their respective labile pools.
   A simple group of variables describing the physical degree of decomposition of organic matter was often as good as, or superior to, more complicated chemical analyses in predicting C, N, and P mineralization. Because pears are classified and mapped according to these variables, it should make scaling efforts in landscape analyses much more tractable.
   Large differences in mineralization rates in northern wetland communities demonstrate that climate change models should not consider these areas as homogeneous entities. Our C mineralization results suggest that soil respiratory response to climate change (as CO(2) and CH(4)) will vary considerably in different wetland communities. Our results also suggest that the common perception that more ombrotrophic sites are inherently more nutrient deficient needs to be reassessed.

AB We examined the influence of the leaf spot pathogen Cercospora kalmiae on reproductive success in self-fertilized vs. outcrossed progeny in the mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia). To explore the interaction between disease incidence and mating system within natural populations of K. latifolia, we ascertained the correlation between disease intensity and two measures of plant reproductive success (proportional fruit set and seedling survival) and partitioned the correlation by pollination treatment (i.e., naturally pollinated, hand pollinated with outcrossed pollen, or self-pollinated). For outcrossed flowers, neither the number of fruits produced nor the performance of seedlings from these fruits was affected by the intensity of disease damage. However, for selfed flowers, both the number of fruits and the performance of seedlings were negatively correlated with disease damage on the maternal parent. Consequently, fungal infection on a maternal plant was associated with an increased proportion of outcrossed progeny produced by the host plant. Motivated by the observed correlation between disease and selfing, we performed a manipulative field experiment to examine the mechanism by which disease could influence the fitness consequences of different mating strategies. We hypothesized that intense C. kalmiae infection reduced K. latifolia resources by reducing photosynthetic leaf area and, consequently, enhanced abortion of self-fertilized fruits more than outcrossed fruits. We found that artificial leaf damage reduced outcrossed fruit set by 17% compared to controls. However, artificial leaf damage reduced selfed fruit set by 31% compared to controls. Similarly, artificial damage did not significantly affect infructescence abortion in outcrossed pollinations. However, for self-pollinated inflorescences, those subtended by damaged leaves experienced a 44% increase in infructescence abortion compared to controls. We conclude that resource limitation, here by leaf damage, can lower the production of self-fertilized seeds relative to outcrossed seeds, thus modifying a plant's mating system.

AB A critical step in understanding food webs and trophic dynamics of communities is quantification of the role of the primary consumers, and a major aspect of such quantification is determination of their production. Annual production and biomass turnover were estimated for the larval chironomid (midge) assemblage found on the submerged woody (snag) habitat of a Coastal Plain blackwater river. Temperature-specific growth rate equations, generated from field growth studies, were applied to the biomass values from quantitative field samples to obtain mean daily production on a monthly basis throughout the year. The most productive genera were the filtering collectors, Rheoranytarsus (31.1 g dry mass.m(-2).yr(-1) for snag surface area) and the gathering collectors, Polypedilum (11.3 g.m(-2).yr(-1)) and Rheocricotopus (9.8 g.m(-2).yr(-1)). Total production was 65.4 g.m(-2).yr(-1) based on summing values of individual taxa, and 69.9 g.m(-2).yr(-1) when applying a family-level equation to biomass of all taxa. When converted to production per square meter of river channel bottom, values were about one-third of the snag surface area estimates (20.1 g.m(-2).yr(-1)). Total chironomid production was somewhat higher in a second sampling year (81.9 g.m(-2).yr(-1) for snag surfaces and 26.8 g.m(-2).yr(-1) for channel bottom). Production was relatively high throughout both years but tended to be lowest in winter with peaks in either summer or fall. These production estimates are among the highest ever reported for chironomids in freshwater systems, primarily owing to extremely high biomass turnover. Annual production/biomass (P/B) values were 158 for Rheocricotopus, 258 for Polypedilum, 196 for Rheotanytarsus, and 202 for total Chironomidae. For Polypedilum, such high annual P/B represents a biomass turnover rate of almost once per day. The P/B values are among the highest estimated for aquatic metazoans (including zooplankton) and are similar to or exceed turnover rates of microbes in many aquatic ecosystems. Such high biomass turnover may be more widespread among freshwater benthic invertebrates than is commonly supposed and may have profound implications for trophic dynamics.

AB The population dynamics of large, long-lived mammals are particularly sensitive to changes in adult survival. Understanding factors affecting survival patterns is therefore critical for developing and testing theories of population dynamics and for developing management strategies aimed at preventing declines or extinction in such taxa. Few studies have used modern analytical approaches for analyzing variation and testing hypotheses about survival probabilities in large mammals. This paper reports a detailed analysis of annual adult survival in the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris), an endangered marine mammal, based on a mark-recapture approach. Natural and boat-inflicted scars distinctively "marked" individual manatees that were cataloged in a computer-based photographic system. Photo-documented resightings provided "recaptures." Using open population models, annual adult-survival probabilities were estimated for manatees observed in winter in three areas of Florida: Blue Spring, Crystal River, and the Atlantic coast. After using goodness-of-fit tests in Program RELEASE to search for violations of the assumptions of mark-recapture analysis, survival and sighting probabilities were modeled under several different biological hypotheses with Program SURGE. Estimates of mean annual probability of sighting varied from 0.948 for Blue Spring to 0.737 for Crystal River and 0.507 for the Atlantic coast. At Crystal River and Blue Spring, annual survival probabilities were best estimated as constant over the study period at 0.96 (95% CI = 0.951-0.975 and 0.900-0.985, respectively). On the Atlantic coast, where manatees are impacted more by human activities, annual survival probabilities had a significantly lower mean estimate of 0.91 (95% CI = 0.887-0.926) and varied unpredictably over the study period. For each study area, survival did not differ between sexes and was independent of relative adult age. The high constant adult-survival probabilities estimated for manatees in the Blue Spring and Crystal River areas were consistent with current mammalian life history theory and other empirical data available for large, long-lived mammals. Adult survival probabilities in these areas appeared high enough to maintain growing populations if other traits such as reproductive rates and juvenile survival were also sufficiently high.

AB We present a new multivariate model for describing jointly fluctuating, density-dependent populations. The model is a stochastic, multivariate version of a discrete-time logistic model that explicitly accounts for spatial variation of growth rate parameters and covariances of fluctuations between populations. Statistical methods for applying the model to time series data on population abundances are described in detail. We derive formulas for maximum-likelihood estimates of model parameters, and we develop hypothesis tests for various reduced model structures, such as density independence or zero covariance. The applicability of the model to any given data set can be thoroughly evaluated with diagnostic procedures. As examples, we apply the model to two population systems: rangeland grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) in three physiographic regions of Montana, USA, and bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) in four tributaries of the Flathead River in Montana. The model and associated statistical methods have potentially important applications in conservation biology for describing metapopulations and for assessing joint jeopardy of multiple populations.

AB A 1993 wildfire and subsequent landslides modified many streams in the Santa Monica Mountains of southern California (USA). Prior to the fire at Cold Creek Canyon, adult California newts (Taricha torosa) frequently preyed on conspecific eggs and larvae. Post-fire landslides increased the number of stream pools containing terrestrial earthworms. Earthworms were more common in adult newt diets after the fire, and conspecifics were absent. More earthworms and fewer conspecifics were present in the stomachs of adult newts in streams at burned sites than at unburned sites. In laboratory experiments, newt larvae used refuges significantly less in the presence of combined chemical cues from both newt adults and earthworms as compared to adult-newt cues alone. These data suggest that cannibalism is reduced in the presence of increased alternative prey items and that larvae can detect this reduced predation risk.

AB Theory on the evolution of pest-induced defenses in plants predicts (1) a negative genetic correlation between induced and constitutive (basal) levels of secondary metabolites, and (2) costs of maintaining high constitutive levels of secondary metabolites. We tested these predictions with genetically diverged populations created by artificial selection on myrosinase and glucosinolate levels in Brassica mpa. Glucosinolates and their breakdown products from the action of the enzyme myrosinase are putative defensive compounds in brassicas. Theory also suggests that effects of genetic changes in secondary metabolites may depend on resource availability, so nitrogen, a main constituent of glucosinolates and myrosinase was added in fertilizer treatments to assess costs. We used the fungal pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans and diamondback moth larvae Plutella xylostella as induction agents in comparisons of the diverged myrosinase populations, We found pleiotropic effects among constitutive myrosinase levels and pathogen-induced levels of myrosinase, glucosinolates, and resistance to diamondback moth larvae. In field experiments, genetic increases in myrosinase production were associated with significant decreases in estimated seed production, despite potential benefits from increased resistance to flea beetles Phylotreta cruciferae. No genotype-by-nitrogen interaction was found. Although costs were detected, our results indicate, in contrast to theory, mainly positive pleiotropic effects between constitutive levels of secondary metabolites and induced responses.

AB We evaluated the effects of flowering-shoot defoliation on pollen production, individual grain size, pollen germination, pollen-tube growth and attrition, and airing ability between paired defoliated and control flowering shoots of Alstroemeria aurea, a common understory herb of the south Andean temperate forest. Defoliation was performed similar to 15 d before anthesis. We estimated pollen production and grain volume from two anthers per shoot from a total of 84 shoot pairs. We used pollen from different control and defoliated paired shoots to pollinate "blocks" of six cut flowers (three per treatment) in the laboratory. From styles fixed at 3, 6, and 12 h after pollination, we estimated pollen germination and tube-growth rates. We also used pollen from different pairs of control and defoliated shoots in single-donor pollinations in the held. From styles collected from field recipient flowers at senescence, we estimated the number of pollen tubes reaching the base of the style after statistically controlling for the number of germinated pollen grains. We counted seeds from mature fruits.
   Pollen production did not differ significantly between control and defoliated shoots, but defoliation did affect pollen quality. Pollen from defoliated shoots was smaller, produced tubes that grew at a slower rate and aborted more frequently, and sired fewer seeds in recipient flowers than did pollen from control shoots. The degree to which pollen-tube growth and attrition differed between a given defoliated shoot and its paired control shoot was positively related to the relative difference the paired shoots exhibited in pollen-grain size. We conclude that leaf removal negatively affects paternal fitness of this hermaphrodite plant by hindering the performance of its pollen within recipient pistils.

AB This paper reports the results of a two-year field experiment on the determinants of fitness responses in Pinguicula vallisneriifolia (Lentibulariaceae), an endemic carnivorous plant of southeastern Spain. For the first time, in this experiment, we have considered irradiance as a factor, in combination with animal prey, for an array of natural field conditions. The goal was to determine how carnivory translates to fitness within different radiation regimes. For this, it was necessary to quantify an array of plant responses, such as survival, growth, reproduction (sexual and vegetative reproduction), as well as responses related to carnivory investment (leaf shape and mucilage secretion). Both irradiance and animal food supply proved to be important limiting factors for P. vallisneriifolia under field conditions. Plants clearly decreased in performance from the sunny habitat to the deep-shade one, with plants growing in the least irradiance registering the lowest values for all variables analyzed. The dearest response to prey was the production of axillary buds. Most vegetative acid reproductive responses depended heavily on the initial biomass of the plant before the experiments, the largest plants bearing the most leaves, flowers, stolons, and axillary buds. A gradient from less to more mucilage secretion appeared from deep-shade to sunny habitat, and within each habitat from prey exclusion to prey addition levels. Trapped prey stimulated digestive secretions in a positive feedback (the more prey, the more mucilage secretion) under all irradiance conditions. The curled, more secretory leaves of the sunny plants, in comparison with the nearly flattened, less secretory leaves of the deep-shade plants, illustrate the constraints imposed by differing scenarios on the capture of both prey and photons.
   With nonlimiting water availability, more irradiance and prey results in more survival, growth, and sexual and vegetative reproduction. Nevertheless, it is not usual to find an optimum combination of resources (i.e., irradiance, prey, and water) available in the same microhabitat during the Mediterranean summer. The spatial uncoupling of limiting resources progressively increased towards the extremes of the irradiance gradient (sunny and deep-shade habitats, respectively), and therefore the dual photosynthetic and carnivore functions of P. vallisneriifolia leaves were not equally efficient in all habitats. These opposing resource gradients determined all vegetative and reproductive plant responses. The perennial character of this endemic plant, together with its vegetative form of propagation, allows the possibility of resisting extinction even in the absence of seedling recruitment or when vegetative growth is strongly limited.

AB In lakes and reservoirs in which Daphnia is able to suppress the biomass of edible algae far below the level set by nutrients, the interaction is stable across the range of nutrient-poor to nutrient-rich environments. This phenomenon contradicts standard con sumer-resource models, which predict that dynamics should become increasingly unstable with enrichment. We test four hypotheses that might account for stability at high-nutrient levels: (1) greater abundance of inedible algae with enrichment interferes with Daphnia's feeding; (2) Daphnia's death rate increases with enrichment; (3) Daphnia's death rate increases with Daphnia density; (4) Daphnia's functional response depends on Daphnia's density. All hypotheses are rejected because they predict much higher biomass of edible algae at high-nutrient levels than is observed. Additional evidence on Daphnia death rates strengthens the case against hypotheses (2) and (3). We consider other hypotheses and conclude that three in particular would repay further investigation. (a) Inedible algae act as a nutrient "sponge," reducing the effective carrying capacity for edible algae; (b) limited spatial movement can enhance stability through a metapopulation-like effect, and (c) stochastic variation among individuals can be stabilizing. The central problem investigated here is a general one, with implications for many consumer-resource systems.

AB Most ecological theory suggests that the conditions that would give rise to the evolution of mutualisms are rare. In contrast, empirical evidence suggests that mutualisms are common. Thus, there appears to be a need for additional theory to describe conditions under which mutualisms may evolve. Furthermore, there is a need for theory to predict the conditions sunder which we expect interactions to remain mutualistic once established. We adopt a biological market approach to present a model for the evolution of resource exchange mutualisms, using the relationship between plants and mycorrhizal fungi as an example. We apply the economic theory of relative advantage to investigate the conditions under which species ought to specialize and trade. A simple economic analogy demonstrates that, in a two-resource model, a species that is relatively efficient at acquiring one resource would benefit from specialization on acquisition of that resource accompanied by trade for the other resource. The theory of relative advantage extends this prediction to show that specialization and trade confer an advantage even for species that are relatively poor resource competitors for both resources. Under the assumptions of our model, we show that two species ought to specialize in the acquisition of one resource and trade for a second resource as long as each species perceives different relative acquisition costs for the two resources. We also describe the conditions under which changing resource availabilities will benefit, or harm, both partners in a mutualism. We predict conditions conducive to mutualisms to occur when the costs of resource exchange are low, the opportunity to ensure fair trade is high, or the cost of tolerating cheaters is low. Market models such as ours may help to explain the conditionality often observed in mutualisms.

AB For two consecutive years (1995 and 1996), the self-thinning processes in nearly pure, even-aged stands of four dominant postfire chaparral species on Santa Monica Mountains, Southern California were quantified through the use of the "upper thinning boundary" and regression lines. During thinning, these species became less dense and more evenly distributed over space, but the total biomass significantly increased; the upper thinning boundaries (of total biomass) of all four species were better described by a slope of -1/2. In contrast, regression slopes of either total biomass or mean biomass per individual against density tended to be shallower than the upper thinning lines. The regression slopes were significantly shallower in 1995 than in 1996, indicating that self-thinning became more evident as biomass accumulated. The differences in regression slopes among species suggested that the stands of these four species were developing under different physical or biological regimes. Self-thinning was closely related to successional species replacement, and changes in canopy structure might be the main cause of variations in the biomass-density relationships. Use of both upper thinning line and regressions could greatly improve our understanding of self-thinning processes and their implications for chaparral succession.

AB This paper analyzes the functional implications of stem tilting and pseudocephalium orientation in the giant columnar cactus Cephalocereus columna-trajani. This species shows a consistent northern orientation of its pseudocephalium (a nonphotosynthetic hairy structure where flowers are produced) and stem tilting in the same direction. Analysis of pseudocephalium orientation was made on field data gathered from subpopulations of C. columna-trajani from slopes with different exposures. Additionally, from morphometric characteristics measured in the field, a model cactus was constructed with the purpose of simulating radiation interception by different morphologies. Variations of this model cactus allowed the simulation of irradiance on erect and tilted facti, as well as on plants with varying pseudocephalium orientation. Results of irradiance interception by different morphologies were related to actual data of growth rates, flowering period, and rainfall and temperature patterns on the study zone. Sampled individuals of C. columna-trajani showed a significant north-northwest pseudocephalium orientation (angular mean = 339 degrees +/- 22 degrees). Simulations showed that tilted cacti with pseudocephalia facing northwards increase yearly interception of direct solar radiation by the whole plant compared to erect cacti with or without a pseudocephalium (2 and 7% increase, respectively), and with tilted cacti with the pseudocephalium facing away from the north (9-10% increase). Additionally. the observed morphology decreases radiation interception during the hottest and driest period of the year. From our results, pseudocephalium orientation and stem tilting in C. columna-trajani appear to be morphological adaptations that allow the fine-tuning of a columnar morphology to its thermal and radiation environment. However, the cost of tilting in this giant columnar cactus is that branching (which increases photosynthetic area and reproductive output) appears to be almost impossible without serious risk of stem breakage.

AB Artificially increasing primary productivity decreases plant species richness in many habitats; herbivory may affect this outcome, but it has rarely been directly addressed in fertilization studies. This experiment was conducted in two Louisiana coastal marshes to examine the effects of nutrient enrichment and sediment addition on herbaceous plant communities with and without vertebrate herbivory. After three growing seasons, fertilization increased community biomass in all plots, but decreased species density (the number of species per unit area) only in plots protected from herbivory. Herbivory alone did not alter species density at either site. At the brackish marsh, herbivory caused a shift in dominance in the fertilized plots from a species that is considered the competitive dominant, but is selectively eaten, to another less palatable species. At the fresh marsh, increased dead biomass in the absence of herbivory and in the fertilized plots probably contributed to the decrease in species density, perhaps by limiting germination of annuals. Our results support those of other fertilization studies in which plant species density decreases with increased biomass, but only in those plots protected from herbivory.

AB Food resources of soil animals of a beechwood (Fagus sylvatica L.) on limestone in northern Germany were manipulated by adding carbon (glucose), nitrogen (as NH4NO3), and phosphorus (as NaH2PO4) separately and in combinations to experimental plots for 15 mo. By adding glucose and nutrients we intended to manipulate microbial biomass in litter and soil which is assumed to form a major part of the food resources of saprophagous soil animals. Manipulation of the microbial part of the diet of saprophagous soil animals allowed us to study the importance of "bottom-up" forces without changing spatial habitat characteristics. Addition of glucose and nutrients caused an increase in microbial biomass with a maximum in the CNP treatment (+52.3%, +51.1%, and +44.0% for the litter layer, for 0-3 and 3-6 cm soil depths, respectively). Separate additions of carbon and nutrients indicated that microorganisms in the litter layer were primarily limited by nitrogen, whereas soil microorganisms were primarily limited by phosphorus. In soil the content of carbon decreased by addition of phosphorus, and in litter the content of nitrogen increased by addition of nitrogen, also indicating that soil microorganisms were limited by phosphorus and litter microorganisms by nitrogen. Nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) concentrations in leaves of ash seedlings growing in experimental plots indicated that competition between microorganisms and plants for nutrients was severe in glucose treatments with microorganisms being the superior competitor. None of the animal groups studied (Lumbricidae, Diplopoda, Isopoda, and Chilopoda) exhibited a response that was parallel to that of microorganisms. Rather, earthworms appeared to be limited by availability of carbon, and in contrast to microorganisms, earthworm numbers and biomass increased strongly with application of glucose only. Maximum biomass of earthworms in the glucose-only treatment indicates that earthworms and microorganisms competed for carbon resources with microorganisms being the superior competitor when carbon and nutrients were available. Earthworm species differentially responded to experimental manipulations, and the density of one species (Aporrectodea rosea) even declined due to glucose applications. The responses of millipedes and isopods were generally less pronounced, but some species increased in numbers under certain treatments. Density of centipedes, particularly that of the soil-dwelling Geophilidae, was strongly reduced due to glucose applications. In contrast to our expectations, earthworms appear not to form a major part of the diet of centipedes in the studied beech forest.

AB The analysis and explanation of the spatial distribution of organisms within a locality are problematic. This study uses a combination of standard analytical methods (Generalized Linear Interactive Modeling [GLIM]) with recently developed spatial statistical techniques (geostatistical analysis), on a model system of insect-plant interactions in an urban setting. Infestations of the horse chestnut scale, Pulvinaria regalis, were mapped on three tree species in Oxford, United Kingdom. Various tree parameters were measured, as were aspects of the site in which each tree was growing. Using general linear modeling and geostatistics, the distribution and intensity of scale populations were investigated in relation to these parameters. The trees were separated into those that showed no symptoms of lack of vigor and those that were clearly unhealthy. In both cases, the only parameter that explained much of the variance in the scale egg densities on trees was the impermeability of the substrate surface under the trees, such that as substrates became more impermeable to water and nutrients (for example, as a result of concrete or roadways), the higher were the pest densities on those trees. For the vigorous trees alone, an extra parameter, that of building distance, was also found to be significant, so that trees very close to buildings also showed high pest densities. The spatial dependence of scale insect eggs on trees was found to be anisotropic through the sample area, in the southwest/northeast direction, attributable to wind speed, direction, and canyon effects.

AB Accurate maps of the locations of trees are useful for many ecological studies but are often difficult to obtain with traditional surveying methods because the trees hinder line of sight measurements. An alternative method, inspired by earlier work of F. Rohlf and J. Archie, is presented. This "Interpoint method" is based solely on tree diameter and tree-to-tree distance measurements. A computer performs the necessary triangulation and detects gross errors. The Interpoint method was used to map trees in seven long-term study plots at the Harvard Forest, ranging from 0.25 ha (200 trees) to 0.80 ha (889 trees). The question of accumulation of error was addressed though a computer simulation designed to model field conditions as closely as possible. The simulation showed that the technique is highly accurate and that errors accumulate quite slowly if measurements are made with reasonable care (e.g., average predicted location errors after 1000 trees and after 10 000 trees were 9 cm and 15 cm, respectively, for measurement errors comparable to field conditions; similar values were obtained in an independent survey of one of the field plots). The technique requires only measuring tapes, a computer, and two or three field personnel. Previous field experience is not required. The Interpoint method is a good choice for mapping trees where a high level of accuracy is desired, especially where expensive surveying equipment and trained personnel are not available.

AB Pollination governs a plant's mating options by establishing the diversity and intensity of male-gamete exchange between plants. For animal-pollinated plants, the pattern of pollen dispersal arises from the pollinator's interactions with floral organs during each flower visit and with the pollen it carries during transport. These interactions typically cause some portions of a flower's pollen to experience different transport conditions than other portions.
   We model three classes of heterogeneous transport conditions to assess their effects on pollen dispersal. Two classes occur when the pollen carried by individual pollinators becomes spatially structured. "Horizontal" structure arises when areas of a pollinator's body differ in their frequency or intensity of contact with anthers and/or stigmas. Alternatively, "vertical" structure develops when pollinators do not disturb their pollen load, causing pollen to accumulate on the pollinator's body in layers, so that much pollen is temporarily inaccessible to stigmas. The third class of heterogeneity occurs when the pollinators that visit a flower differ consistently with respect to pollen transfer from pollinator to stigmas. These classes of heterogeneous transport produce similar mean patterns of pollen dispersal, which differ from that expected if transported pollen acts as a homogeneous population. In particular, near and far recipient flowers receive proportionately more of the donor pollen reaching stigmas than predicted for a single population. Reanalysis of data in the literature illustrates that predictions based on heterogeneous transport conditions are more representative of observed dispersal patterns than predictions of the traditional characterization of pollen dispersal. We also demonstrate that stochastic variation between flowers in pollen donation and receipt does not affect the arithmetic mean pattern of pollen dispersal, although it does reduce the geometric mean.
   Although the different types of heterogeneous transport conditions produce similar mean patterns of pollen dispersal, the influences of specific floral and pollinator characteristics on dispersal can depend on the type(s) of heterogeneity involved. In particular, pistil characteristics should affect dispersal independently of stamen characteristics when horizontal heterogeneity governs transport dynamics, but not when pollen accumulates in layers. This relation is likely reflected in many aspects of floral divergence among related taxa pollinated by different vectors and convergent design among unrelated taxa served by similar vectors.

AB Although pollen is included in the diet of vertebrates and invertebrates, and extraction efficiency of its contents has been estimated for several flower visitors, the relationship between feeding habits and pollen digestion efficiency has not been carefully studied. We compared the efficiency with which four species of New World bats with different feeding habits extracted the contents of different types of pollen, and we tested the hypothesis that flower-visiting bats have higher extraction efficiencies than fruit-eating bats. We gave doses of different types of pollen to two nectarivorous (Anoura geaffroyi and Leptonycteris curasoae) and two frugivorous (Artibeus jamaicensis and Sturnira lilium) bats and collected their feces at regular intervals. We used pollen from three species of flowers that are associated with bat visitation: Pseudobombax ellipticum, Hylocereus undatus, and an unidentified species of night-blooming, columnar cactus. In addition to estimating the percentage of empty pollen grains in the feces, we determined digesta time distributions in the gastrointestinal tract and interpreted them using chemical reactor theory. Extraction efficiency was higher in bats that regularly include pollen in their diet. This pattern was not explained by differences in the rare with which the bats processed pollen, or by the time that pollen was retained in the stomach, where little degradation of pollen grains occurs. Within species, however, the percentage of empty grains increased asymptotically with time in the gastrointestinal tract. In general, the digestive system of the bats seemed to process pollen grains as a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) connected to a plug-how reactor (PFR), with longitudinal mixing in the PFR: the food was retained for a relatively short period in the stomach and then was moved through the intestine, where it was mixed longitudinally. Artibeus jamaicensis was an exception to this pattern in the way its digestive system processed H. undatus pollen; in this case, its gastrointestinal tract apparently functioned as a PFR with a considerable amount of longitudinal mixing. We hypothesize that differences among bats in extraction efficiency of pollen contents may be partly explained by differences in the intestinal activity of the enzymes responsible for pollen grain degradation.

AB A set of stage-structured competition models is considered. The models are parameterized using allometric relationships specific to four fish life history strategies, constraining the model to biologically plausible regions in parameter space. Using a coupled consumer-resource competition model, I get the paradoxical result that two populations can coexist in equilibrium on an identical resource base, without recourse to temporal or spatial partitioning. In contrast to much theory on limiting similarity, the model also predicts that fish populations of similar life history strategies can coexist in equilibrium with complete resource overlap. This form of coexistence (called density-dependent coexistence) requires that life history strategies differ such that an advantage at one stage of the life cycle implies a disadvantage at another stage in the life cycle. These exact life history trade-offs appear in small-bodied fish. Furthermore, it is postulated that this result may be applicable to other taxa.

AB Hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) was an abundant tree species in eastern North America before it declined sharply in abundance similar to 4700 C-14 yr BP (similar to 5400 calendar years BP). The rapid, apparently synchronous, and species-specific nature of the decline suggests that it was the result of a pathogenic outbreak. T. canadensis is a highly shade-tolerant, long-lived conifer, and its sudden removal from the canopy is likely to have had an impact on forest composition, structure, and function. The response of forest vegetation to the mid-Holocene hemlock decline at two sites in southern Ontario, Canada was examined using paleoecological methods. At one site, where T. canadensis declined sharply, several other forest taxa increased in abundance, resulting in a long-term shift in forest composition. At a second site, pollen percentages of T. canadensis did not decrease so dramatically, and less change in forest composition occurred. At both sites, T. canadensis took similar to 2000 yr to recover from the decline and reach former abundance levels. This study suggests that the mid-Holocene decline of a forest dominant may have had a long-term impact on forest composition in northeastern North America.

AB The theoretical validity of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis is investigated with a model for hierarchical competition between marine species that have space-limited, benthic adults and pelagic larvae. The model explicitly incorporates larval and adult dynamics for two species, one of which overgrows the other. Conclusions include: (1) The subordinate must be a stress tolerator or ruderal for coexistence with a competitive dominant. (2) The intermediate disturbance principle is a moderate-to-high settlement phenomenon: coexistence is possible at sufficiently low settlement even without the aid of disturbance, but at high settlement, a dominant with greater benthic ability excludes the subordinate at all levels of disturbance. (3) Given coexistence, increasing disturbance drives the dominant extinct first. (4) For a Erred level of disturbance, an "intermediate recruitment hypothesis" fields: at low settlement only the subordinate exists, at intermediate settlement there is coexistence, and at high settlement the dominant excludes the subordinate. (5) A gradient in settlement is sufficient to generate benthic zonation, so negative covariation between settlement and disturbance accentuates disturbance's effect, and positive covariation diminishes it. (6) The effects of area and settlement an coexistence in this model are equivalent. (7) Coexistence is favored when the subordinate body size is small compared to the dominant, conditional on larval production.

AB We examined spatial, physiological, and morphological niche relationships in a Phoxinus eos-neogaeus gynogenetic complex of cyprinid fish in five drainages influenced by beaver (Castor canadensis) activity along the 294-km(2) Kabetogama Peninsula in Voyageurs National Park of northern Minnesota. Assessment of clonal variation using "in gel" DNA fingerprinting of gynogens from three drainages indicated that all drainages contained only a single clone. When environments associated with beaver pond succession were pooled across drainages, P. eos was more abundant in active beaver ponds, while gynogens were at higher frequencies in collapsed pond and stream environments. Gynogen frequency for different successional environments classified according to drainage indicated strong variation among drainages, especially in pond environments, but a consistent pattern of increased gynogen frequency in collapsed ponds or streams. Intensive sampling within one drainage across successional beaver pond sites, physical habitats, and gradients of oxygen concentration indicated that P. eos, P. neogaeus, and gynogens were all most abundant in the highly oxygenated littoral environment of an upland pond. P. eos abundance and its relative frequency in the gynogenetic complex decreased, while gynogen frequency increased, in a poorly oxygenated collapsed beaver pond and beaver meadow. Fish transplant experiments revealed that gynogens survived longer and had greater physiological tolerance to oxygen stress than sexual progenitors, especially P. eos. Principal component analysis of 11 growth-related morphometric characteristics revealed morphological intermediacy of the hybrid gynogens between the sexual progenitors, with factors related to trophic morphology, especially mouth width and mouth length, segregating the different forms. A comparison of morphological relationships in a beaver pond with a gynogen frequency of 25-35% to those of a pond with a gynogen frequency of only 6-7% suggested that there was a release in the trophic morphology of P. eos in response to reduced gynogen abundance. The temporal and spatial unpredictability of environmental conditions in the north temperate landscape inhabited by these fish has apparently resulted in selection for a physiologically flexible, "general purpose" clonal genotype, which occupies a broad ecological niche and may make establishment of additional clones in the same ecosystem difficult.

AB Species colonizing large-scale disturbances face heterogeneous environmental conditions that may strongly affect the relationship between phenotypic variation and reproduction. We investigated spatiotemporal variation in individual plant flowering phenology, flower and fruit predation, plant size, and fruit production in populations of Lupinus lepidus colonizing landscapes created by the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. We quantified these variables in three populations in 1990, one that survived the 1980 eruption and two newly founded colonizing populations, and continued study of one newly founded population through 1992. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the direct and indirect effects of size, phenological variables, and predation on fecundity, and to compare path coefficients among years and populations. Flowering phenologies were constant among populations and years in colonizing populations, but plants in the surviving population flowered earlier, more synchronously, and for a shorter duration. Flower and fruit predation by lepidopteran herbivores varied substantially among populations and years, and phenological variables strongly influenced herbivore damage. Although mean flowering date had a direct positive effect on fruit number in all three years in the large colonizing population, the total effect of flowering date varied among years because later flowering resulted in greater fruit predation. In the surviving population more asynchronous individuals had more fruits, but mean date had no effect. We conclude that substantial spatiotemporal variability in optimal phenology may prevent fine-scale adaptation of flowering schedules, and that phenotypic variation and herbivory may affect the demography of colonization populations.

AB The role of omnivory in structuring communities is potentially great in lowland neotropical streams that are characterized by an abundance of macroconsumers that consume both insects and algae. Here, we separate effects of natural densities of diurnal fishes and nocturnal shrimps in structuring the benthic community of a stream draining Costa Pica's Atlantic slope. We experimentally manipulated the spatial and temporal access of fishes and shrimps to benthic resources, in situ, using electric "fences" powered by solar-powered fence chargers.
   Both fishes and shrimps significantly reduced inorganic sediment mass, organic ash-free dry mass (AFDM), densities of larval Chironomidae, and total insects: their combined effects were greater than effects of either group alone, and there was no significant interaction. Fishes shifted algal community composition from diatoms to green and blue-green algae and benthic insect communities towards chironomids, while shrimps had no significant effect on community composition. Effects of fishes were generally greater than those of shrimps, and this is due, in part, to higher natural densities and foraging pressures of fishes. Furthermore, shrimps foraged for significantly longer periods of time in the treatment where fishes were excluded than in the combined fish and shrimp access treatment, suggesting that diurnally feeding fishes are strong "interactors," mediating resource availability to nocturnally feeding shrimps.
   Natural erosion and sediment-mediated effects of macroconsumers (both direct and indirect) also affected algal communities: a manual sediment removal experiment resulted in significant reductions of diatom biovolume and increases in the filament length of green and blue-green algae. Our results show the importance of: (1) assessing macroconsumer effects in a relatively natural depositional environment subject to background erosion and sloughing (i.e., in this case by using electric exclosures); (2) evaluating effects of natural densities of both diurnal and nocturnal macroconsumers through time in the context of these abiotic effects; and (3) distinguishing between the response of different types of algal resources (e.g., diatoms vs. green and blue-green algae), which are differentially affected by sedimentation and erosion. Cage experiments, short-term observations, or one-time sampling of undifferentiated "algae" may artificially overestimate trophic effects and underestimate abiotic effects. We found no evidence of a trophic cascade. Our findings are in agreement with the theoretical prediction that large-sized omnivores have strong direct trophic (feeding) effects, both on smaller primary consumers (insects) and basal resources (algae).

AB A common assumption of ecological theories addressing the causes of spatial dominance and stability in natural communities is that organisms have trade-offs between resistance to disturbance, environmental tolerance, and competitive abilities, i.e., that different species or groups of species dominate under different regimes of disturbance and stress. A multifactorial field experiment was conducted from June 1994 to October 1995 in a turf-dominated macroalgal assemblage on a rocky subtidal shore south of Livorno (western Mediterranean, Italy) to test the hypothesis that variable patterns of disturbance and stress influence the differential success of species, and to identify functional characteristics resulting in persistent monopolization of space. The experiment, which included manipulation of the depositional environment, was designed specifically to test whether patterns of recovery following abrasion or removal of the biota differed among patches of different sizes, produced at different times of the year and at different locations and undergoing different rates of sediment deposition.
   Variable size, intensity, timing and location of disturbance, and variable stress induced by deposition of sediment significantly influenced the success of erect algae that persist by sexual reproduction but did not affect spatial dominance by the filamentous algal turf. The turf regained space very quickly by vegetative reproduction and persisted as the dominant species in all the experimental plots, independent of the disturbance and stress regimes imposed. The impressive rate of vegetative propagation was identified as a major determinant of the structure of the assemblage and the probable basis for the capability of the turf to compete for space and resist disturbance. Patterns of growth may be as crucial as the disturbance regime in determining community structure, and "packaging" of competitive and resistance abilities into a single species or group of species could be more common than generally thought.

AB Male tenebrionid beetles from the Namib Desert are captured by predators more frequently than females. Males exhibit several behaviors that predispose them to an increased risk of mortality from predation. In attempts to find and monopolize females, males are more active on the surface, move more frequently, and travel farther than females. One result of such activity is a bias in captures by predators and pitfall traps. These biased sex ratios differ significantly from those in censused natural populations and an assumed 1:1 sex ratio. We suggest that such differential predation is a major cost of reproduction and can constrain sexual selection.

AB The need to study movement in specific ecosystems in order to understand population dynamics in space is appreciated among ecologists. Ecological data is, however, often collected at small scales making large-scale predictions dubious at best. To examine whether extrapolations across scales are possible, we build observed behaviors affecting movement of three carabid beetle species, Pterostichus cupreus, P. melanarius and P. niger (Coleoptera, Carabidae), into a spatially explicit individual-based model (IBM) to study patterns at a number of spatial scales. Field-tracking recordings of individual beetles are fitted to a biased random walk (BRW) model and inserted into the IBM together with data on settling behavior. Beetles will often stop and rest during their activity periods. A range of probabilities for alternation between active and resting behavior are tested in the model at several prey levels.
   We found that at large scales, in this case movement over hundreds of meters and several seasons, diffusion is a good approximation for population spread. At small scales of around one meter, BRW describes movement accurately. At intermediate scales we need both BRW, resting, and changes between these behaviors to describe motion effectively in the model. The area covered by the beetles increases linearly over time, while the maximum distance moved does not, indicating an approximately circular expansion and a thorough search of area traversed. Seasonal range and estimated rate of movement differed among species depending on prey availability but was not correlated to body size.

AB Many aggressive animals form territory mosaics marked by distinct boundaries. This paper describes an approach to modeling territory size and shape within mosaics based on boundary disputes among neighboring animals. The model assumes that each resident applies pressure against its neighbors, as a result of aggression and display, and that boundaries form curves along which the pressure exerted by adjacent residents is equal. To illustrate, I predicted territory boundaries for populations of the fire ant Solenopsis iavicta using several alternative mathematical descriptions of territorial fighting. According to the most successful formula, the aggressive pressure applied at any point on the territory perimeter increases linearly with the biomass of the defending colony but decreases with territory area and with the square of the distance to the colony's nest. An iterative algorithm predicts the size and location of boundary segments given the positions and sizes of colonies.
   By all measured criteria, this model produced more accurate predictions of territory areas and shapes than alternative models that omit the effects of resident size or the dependence of aggressive pressure on territory area. Modifications can incorporate nest relocations, strategic variation in the degree of aggressive pressure applied, habitat heterogeneity, and other biological details. However, even with simple assumptions, the model predicts much of the variation in the sizes and shapes of fire ant territories in natural conditions. This implies that territories are molded by a balance of aggression between neighbors and that each territory is affected by the actions of numerous residents.

AB In several tropical lowland rain forests, removal of root competition by trenching around seedlings and saplings has been shown to have little or no impact on growth rate. However, we found that trenching increased the aboveground growth rate of saplings and seedlings of a wide variety of species in an Amazonian caatinga. This low-statured forest develops on waterlogged, humus-rich, white-sand soil that is extremely low in available nitrogen. Analysis of foliar nutrient concentrations and a fertilizer experiment confirmed previous findings that nitrogen is limiting, while measures of soil moisture potential and stomatal resistance gave no indication of water shortage. We suggest that belowground competition has an impact on growth rate because (1) established trees allocate a large proportion of biomass to fine-root production, further reducing the availability of nutrients in an inherently poor soil, and (2) penetration of daylight to the sapling layer is greater than under other tropical lowland rain forests (1-3% vs. 0.5-1%). Although trenching had no effect on percentage mortality (12% over 18 mo), it reduced the percentage of naturally regenerating seedlings exhibiting net leaf loss from 28 to 8%. Surprisingly, the magnitude of response was similar in gaps and understory and was similar among species, suggesting that trenching had a larger effect on allocation than on the rate of photosynthesis or respiration.

AB This study tests experimentally the hypothesis that Pheinole bicornis ants increase the fitness of Piper ant-plants (Piperaceae) in Costa Rican forests. In two experiments with naturally occurring Piper ant-plants, similar to 50 individuals were randomly selected and maintained either as controls (with ants) or as ant-exclusion plants (without ants) for 2 yr. Leaf replacement rates and seed production, as measures of relative plant vigor and reproductive potential, were significantly greater in control plants with intact ant colonies than in plants from which ant colonies were experimentally excluded by periodical treatment with dilute insecticide.
   A series of experiments was designed to assess the relative contribution of antiherbivore defense, nutrient procurement, and antipathogen defense as potential mutualistic functions of the ants. To assess the fitness effects of antiherbivore defense, leaf replacement rates and seed production were measured on plants to which artificial folivory was applied over a 2-yr period (33% of each leaf blade removed), and stem-boring weevil damage was monitored on plants with and without ants. Nutrient procurement by ants was estimated quantitatively, and net leaf production was monitored experimentally on control plants (with ants), on plants without ants, and on nutrient-enriched plants with ants (microquantities of fertilizer added to lower stem). Epiphyll loads, phylloplane spore densities, and disease incidence were compared on experimental plants with and without ant colonies. The results indicate that folivory, the classical parameter measured in ant-plant studies, was not related to differences in fitness in Piper ant-plants; instead, ant disruption of stem-borers and ant foraging on inflorescences to reduce fungal invasion were identified as probable mechanisms by which ants conferred an average fitness advantage of at least 60 and 10%, respectively, in the 2nd yr of the comparison. Although neither antifolivore defense nor nutrient provisioning by ants appeared to benefit Piper plants, they may contribute synergistically or may operate on temporal or spatial scales not included in the study. For example, nutrient provisioning may allow Piper ant-plant species to occupy and compete favorably in poor-soil habitats not evaluated in these experiments.

AB Workers of Aphaenogaster rudis collect seeds of many species of spring-flowering, perennial herbs. This is part of a seed-dispersal system (myrmecochory) for which benefits to plants are documented, but consequences to ants have not been quantified. To test the predictions that colony size or reproductive output will be enhanced as a consequence of ants collecting seeds, we conducted a field experiment in a forest near Gambler, Ohio, in June and July 1993.
   Experimental colonies receiving seeds of Sanguinaria canadensis (N = 24 colonies) had similar to 3.5 times as many gynes as control colonies (N = 27). Only 25% of control colonies produced any gynes, whereas 65% of experimental colonies did so. Control colonies produced as many males as experimental colonies. Access to seeds shifted the mass and numerical investment ratio in colony reproductive output toward female bias but did not affect the number of workers or queen size. These data support the hypothesis that myrmecochory is a true mutualism. Additionally, the experiment indicates that resource levels influence investment ratios in reproductive ants.

AB The role of environmental variation in the population dynamics of the tropical understory shrub Ardisia escallonioides was explored using single-environment matrix analysis and dynamic-environment megamatrix analysis. We investigated how variation in forest-canopy openness caused by hurricanes affected population dynamics. A 7 x 7 patch-transition matrix was created to model forest dynamics based on the historical frequency and strength of hurricanes in south Florida. Seven 8 x 8 stage-classified matrices for plant population dynamics were derived from four field populations and two posthurricane years. These populations spanned a strong gradient of forest-canopy openness resulting from hurricane disturbance caused by Hurricane Andrew (24 August 1992). The patch-transition matrix was analyzed for its stable patch distribution. The seven single-environment matrices were each analyzed for population growth rates and elasticity of stage classes. The 56 x 56 megamatrix was analyzed for population growth rate, reproductive value, stable patch-stage distribution, and elasticity of both patches and stages.
   Population growth rate of the single-environment matrix models (8 x 8) was lowest for the shadiest environment (lambda = 1.0), intermediate but variable for intermediate environments, and highest for the most open environment (lambda = 1.96). The population growth rate (lambda) of the megamatrix model was 1.71. The stable patch-stage distribution was characterized by a high proportion of seeds in open patches. Reproductive value was highest for very large adults in open patches. Megamatrix elasticity analysis revealed several components of the demography that were not apparent from examination of the single-environment matrices. Although closed-canopy patches were the most common type of environment, elasticity analysis of the megamatrix showed that the highest patch elasticity was for the most open environment. We found contrasting predictions for the relative importance of life history stages to population growth rate from single-environment analysis vs. the megamatrix analysis. In the most common single-environment patch, very large adults had the highest elasticity. In the megamatrix, small juveniles contributed the most elasticity and all stages contributed some elasticity. For plant species inhabiting temporally varying environments, megamatrix analysis offers new insight into the importance of both patches and stage classes.

AB Metapopulation dynamics have received much attention in conservation and population biology, but the standard approach has also been criticized for being too restrictive, as it is based on the effects of habitat patch area and isolation only. Here we demonstrate how the effects of habitat quality (extra environmental factors) and detailed landscape structure (described with GIS [Geographical Information System]) can be included in a spatially realistic metapopulation model, the incidence function model. Expanded models are tested with a large data set on the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia). The incidence function model supplemented with additional environmental factors revealed some new and confirmed some previously known interactions between M. cinxia and its environment. However, the ability of the additional environmental factors to explain the error in the fit of the basic model was generally low (less than or equal to 15%). In the second variant of the basic model, landscape structure was used to modify effective patch isolations. This approach, though biologically appealing, failed to improve significantly the fit of the incidence function model. There are several possible reasons for this failure, including inaccurate satellite data, problems with habitat classification, and most importantly, generic problems in the modeling of migration. Our results demonstrate that additional complexity beyond the effects of habitat patch area and isolation does not necessarily improve the predictive power of a metapopulation model.

AB We examined the effect of decomposing leaf litter and dissolved inorganic nutrients on the heterotrophic biofilm of submerged wood in streams with and without leaves. Leaf litter was excluded from one headwater stream in August 1993 at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in the southern Appalachian Mountains. We compared microbial processes on wood in the litter-excluded stream to a reference stream using microbial respiration, fungal biomass, and extracellular enzyme activity. Exclusion of leaf litter enhanced microbial respiration and extracellular enzyme activity, and fungal biomass was seven times higher than in the reference stream. Nutrient-releasing substrates placed beneath wood veneers indicated colimitation by nitrogen and phosphorus on biofilms in the reference stream. Our conclusion is that, in the absence of nutrient immobilization by leaves, nutrients are more available for other heterotrophic processes. Nutrient limitation may have been responsible for low microbial respiration, fungal biomass, and extracellular enzyme activity on wood in the reference stream containing leaves. Our results suggest that competition for nutrients may regulate heterotrophic microbial processes in these streams.

AB We studied the invasion of a New Zealand mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) forest by the exotic perennial herb, Hieracium lepidulum. We used data from 250 randomly located permanent plots (400 m(2)) established in 1970 that sampled 9000 ha of forest. Frequency of H. lepidulum was 11%, 43%, and 57% in 1970, 1985, and 1993, respectively. For each year of measurement, invasion patterns were related to (a) distance to the forest margin as a measure of dispersal limitation, (b) community structure, (c) Stem biomass dynamics indicating disturbance history, and (d) environmental characteristics. In 1970, invaded plots had more species and lower potential solar radiation, and they were closer to the forest margin; however, invaded plots were only weakly predicted by these site variables. H. lepidulum also invaded relatively species-rich subplots (0.75 m(2)) showing that community structure was also significant at a microsite scale. Using the same sets of variables, the ability to predict which plots were invaded in any year increased from 1970 to 1993. This supports our hypothesis that in early invasion stages, with dispersal limitation, an invader may occur in only a subset of suitable sites giving a weak relationship with site variables. By 1993, distance to the forest margin was no longer related to which plots were invaded, and invaded plots had more species, occurred at lower elevations on more sheltered topographic positions, and had more fertile soils than uninvaded plots. Even though site variables were not independent (e.g., plots on fertile soils tend to have more species), multiple logistic regression showed that, all else being equal, invaded plots still tended to have more species than those not invaded. Our study therefore questions the hypothesis that, all else being equal, species-poor habitats are more prone to invasion by exotic species.

AB Increasing "greenhouse" gases are predicted to warm the earth by several degrees Celsius during the coming century. At high elevations one likely result is a longer snow-free season, which will affect plant growth and reproduction. We studied flowering and fruiting of 10 angiosperm species in a subalpine meadow over 4 yr, focusing on plant responses to warming by overhead heaters. The 10 species reproduced in a predictable sequence during 3-4 mo between spring snowmelt and fall frosts. Experimental warming advanced the date of snowmelt by almost 1 wk on average, relative to controls, and similarly advanced the mean timing of plant reproduction. This phenological shift was entirely explained by earlier snowmelt in the case of six plant species I:hat flowered early in the season, whereas four later-flowering species apparently responded to other cues.
   Experimental warming had no detectable effect on the duration of flowering and fruiting, even though natural conditions of early snowmelt were associated with longer duration and greater overlap of reproduction of sequentially flowering species. Fruit set was greater in warmed plots for most species, but this effect was not significant for any species individually. We conclude that global warming will cause immediate phenological shifts in plant communities at high elevations, mediated largely through changes in timing of snowmelt. Shifts on longer time scales are also likely as plant fitnesses, population dynamics, and community structure respond to altered phenology of species relative to one another and to animal mutualists and enemies. However, the small spatial scale of experiments such as ours and the inability to perfectly mimic all elements of climate change limit our ability to predict these longer term changes. A promising future direction is to combine experiments with study of natural phenological variation on landscape and larger scales.

AB Spider density on desert islands in the Gulf of California is a joint function of variable productivity (bottom-up effects) and consumer intensity (top-down effects). Data from 20 islands and five years (1990-1994) show that the cumulative productivity of islands, a sum of the input of marine detritus and terrestrial plant productivity, varies spatially and temporally. Marine inputs are a function of the perimeter/area ratio and are thus relatively greater on smaller islands. Land plant productivity, a function of precipitation, is negligible in most years but can increase greatly (10-160X in plant cover) with heavy rains from El Nino events (e.g., 1992-1993). Consumer intensity is a function of the continual influence of predaceous scorpions and the sporadic occurrence of parasitoid spider wasps (Pompilidae); the importance of these factors varies greatly, both because scorpions are absent on some islands and because parasitoid densities show extreme year-to-year oscillations.
   El Nino rains produced large changes in the quantity and quality of plant resources and the control of spider populations. Spider densities doubled in 1992 in response to high levels of prey that followed heavy rains but crashed in 1993, despite continued high plant productivity and prey availability. The appearance of copious nectar and pollen, food of adult parasitoid wasps, caused wasp populations to erupt in 1993. Wasps emerged as a major, but previously hidden, trophic influence and greatly suppressed spider populations. Pompilids act as nonequilibrium agents-they are regulated by factors other than prey (spider) availability. In general, smaller spider populations were more variable year to year in the magnitude of their increases and decreases.
   In spite of the great temporal and spatial variability, consistent changes in plant, prey, spider, and wasp dynamics occurred repeatedly and apparently independently on islands throughout the archipelago. Such patterns of concerted change strongly suggest that general processes related to productivity and consumption are key to understanding the dynamics of this system.

AB In a general theoretical ecosystem model, we investigate the conditions under which herbivores increase primary production and lead to grazing optimization through recycling of a limiting nutrient.
   Analytical and simulation studies of the model lead to several general results. Grazing optimization requires that (1) the proportion of nutrient lost along the herbivore pathway be sufficiently smaller than the proportion of nutrient lost throughout the rest of the ecosystem; and that (2) inputs of nutrient into the system be greater than a threshold value, which depends on the sensitivity of plant uptake rate to an increase in soil mineral nutrient. An increase in nutrient turnover rate is not sufficient to explain grazing optimization in the long term. When a nutrient is the single limiting factor, plant biomass and productivity at equilibrium are determined only by the balance of ecosystem inputs and outputs of nutrient. Processes that do not have an impact on these inputs or outputs have no effect on primary producers.
   On the other hand, turnover rates are important for the transient dynamics of the system, and the equilibrium analysis is relevant only if it can be reached in a reasonable time scale. The equilibrium is not reached by a compartment with a very slow turnover rate, such as the resistant soil organic matter, before several centuries. On a small time scale, such a compartment can be considered constant, and the trend of the system is predicted with a simplified system.
   The results at equilibrium are insensitive to the functional form used to describe herbivore consumption: the results obtained for simple, linear, donor-controlled herbivory also apply to most forms of more realistic, recipient-controlled herbivory.
   We conclude that grazing optimization is most likely to occur in systems with large losses of the limiting nutrient during recycling of plant detritus, or where herbivores bring nutrient from outside the ecosystem considered (which acts to reduce, or even make negative, the fraction of nutrient lost along the herbivore detritus pathway).

AB Predators often face a trade-off between energy gain and risk of injury, and their foraging decisions should thus vary with conditions that influence this trade-off. We studied how wind speed affected the foraging decisions of Glaucous Gulls preying on Thick-billed Murres breeding on Coats Island, Northwest Territories, Canada in 1990-1992. At this colony, murres bred at varying densities on broad and narrow cliff ledges. Under calm wind conditions (<10 km/h), aerial search and attack activity by gulls was low. At wind speeds >15 km/h, gulls searched more actively and focused their aerial attacks on nest sites on narrow ledges. Aerial attacks on narrow ledges were less successful (in number of eggs or chicks taken per attack) than attacks made on foot on broad ledges. However, aerial attacks also had a lower incidence of contact with defending murres because: (1) gulls could approach ledges readily by gliding; (2) murres on narrow ledges could not turn to fend off attacking gulls without dislodging their eggs or chicks; and (3) dense groups of murres on broad ledges defended their eggs and chicks communally. Gulls foraged successfully on foot on broad ledges despite communal defense by murres, although they suffered a greater risk of being struck on the head by defending murres. Because gulls favored aerial attacks under windy conditions, we concluded that a trade-off between maximizing energy gain acid minimizing risk of injury determines foraging decisions by gulls in this system, and that this trade-off was mediated by wind.

AB Most natural plant populations are attacked by a suite of enemy species, but there are differing views on how commonly individuals within populations must confront multiple enemies. I evaluated during 10 years the number of insect and pathogen taxa attacking leaves and flowers on tagged individuals of Lomatium dissectum (Apiaceae), a long-lived herbaceous perennial. In addition, I determined the minimum number of established plants killed by pocket gophers. At least 43% of the deaths were attributable directly to feeding on roots by gophers. On average 68% of plants were attacked each year by at least one insect or pathogen species, and plants harbored each year a mean of 1.6 insect/ pathogen species. By year 10 all surviving plants had been attacked by at least two enemies. Yearly attack by a small number of enemy species is a pervasive part of the life history of individual plants within this population.

We investigated links between predator distributions, predation intensity, rainfall, the depth of the LSL, and sessile invertebrate community structure at two sites in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand. Sessile invertebrate communities living on the rock walls of the fjord showed striking patterns of vertical zonation corresponding to the depth of the LSL. Barnacles and mussels, Mytilus edulis galloprovincialis, were most abundant at the 1-3 m depth range commonly bathed by the LSL, while sponges, bryozoans, and ascidians dominated space below it (6-18 m depth). Mussel abundance declined sharply with depth at both sites, from maxima of 52-80% cover in the LSL (3 m) to <2% cover just below the LSL (6 m). To test the hypothesis that the LSL influences the lower limit of the mussel zone by excluding predators and reducing predation from mobile invertebrates living below it, we measured predator densities and tracked predation on transplanted mussels, M. e. galloprovincialis, in the LSL (2.5 m depth) and at 3-4 depths below. Predators were most abundant just below the lower boundary of the LSL during February and April 1993. No transplanted mussels were consumed in the LSL at 2.5 m, but 20-80% of them were consumed in experiments conducted below it, indicating that the LSL represents a spatial refuge from predation.
   The shallowing of the LSL to 1.5 m depth during low rainfall in November 1993 provided an additional opportunity to evaluate the influence of the LSL on predation. Repeated predator surveys showed that sea stars and urchins moved up with the ascending LSL to create a pattern of high predator abundance at 2.5 m depth in November, suggesting that the shallow zone previously buffered from predation by the LSL was not a predation refuge in November.
   Rainfall and salinity at 2.5 m depth were inversely related. A significant regression of rainfall one day prior to salinity profiling and the depth of the LSL boundary (30 mg/g salinity) explained 61.5% of the variation in the depth of the boundary, which represented the maximum depth of the predation refuge. The regression enabled us to predict the depth of the predation refuge over a 1.5-yr period beginning in October 1992. The average depth of the refuge was 2.35 m, ranging from 1.5 to 5.6 m as a function of rainfall. Daily tidal variation increased the vertical excursion of the refuge by 0.9-1.7 m. Distinguishing between a partial predation refuge where the LSL occurred at a given depth for a part of a day, and a complete refuge where a depth occurred in the refuge for the entire day, we estimated that the 2.5-m habitat was a complete refuge during 10% of the 18-mo period and a partial predation refuge 90% of the time. The dose correspondence between the average depth of the predation refuge (2.35 m) and the depth of maximum mussel cover (3.0 m) suggests that the mussel zone is restricted to the LSL by high predation at the lower boundary of the layer. The alternative hypothesis, that the lower limit of the mussel zone (6 m depth) was determined by a failure of mussel recruitment to this depth, was tested by a l-yr recruitment experiment. Mussels recruited to the lower edge of the mussel zone at 6 m, although overall levels of mussel recruitment during May 1993-April 1994 were too low to maintain the observed zonation pattern.
   By increasing the spatial extent of the low-salinity layer, we speculate that changes in climatic conditions leading to increased freshwater runoff may alter salinity gradients, bathymetric distributions of predators, and the structure of shallow subtidal communities, especially in fjords.

AB Flowering plants often produce more flowers than fruits. An initial "excess" of flowers, although making no numerical contribution to fruit set, may indirectly increase female reproductive success by allowing selective maturation of fruits of superior quality. I use a framework based on order statistics to assess the potential fitness benefit from this "wider choice" mechanism. The analysis shows that a floral surplus with subsequent selective abortion can generate large increases in mean female fitness. However, marginal fitness returns always diminished as the floral surplus increased (i.e., the fitness gain curve was always saturating), and imperfect selectivity of abortion could severely mute the advantages of surplus flowers. If the mating environment creates low variance in quality among developing fruits, then little benefit is derived from surplus flowers, while a high variance allows large fitness gains but with rapidly saturating benefits. The results imply that selection on flower number due to wider choice could be very strong in some circumstances, but that selection through this mechanism may often favor only a modest number of excess Rowers.

AB We radiotracked 184 reproductive active root vole Microtus oeconomus individuals in 12 experimentally fragmented populations to test predictions regarding responses in spatiosocial organization to habitat fragmentation and connectivity. We used two genetically distinct strains with different intrinsic characteristics to test explicitly for interactions between spacing behavior and the degree of habitat fragmentation and connectivity. The experimental habitat configurations were created by mowing enclosed meadow plots so that habitat (meadow) fragments were imbedded in a hostile, barren matrix of nonhabitat. We used three types of habitat patch configurations to contrast two levels of fragmentation (large vs. small habitat fragments) and two levels of connectivity (small isolated vs. small corridor connected habitat fragments), while keeping the total area of habitat and distances between fragments constant. The least fragmented systems contained two habitat fragments large enough to encompass several female home ranges (large fragment plots). Both of the two other habitat configurations contained six small habitat fragments, each of the size corresponding to the home range of a single female. The two small fragment configurations differed with respect to connectivity in that one configuration had 0.5 m wide corridors connecting two triplets of patches (corridor plots), while the other small patch configuration had no corridors (small fragment plots). Four population replicates (two of each root vole strain) of each configuration were employed over two years.
   Home range area estimates showed rather complex responses to habitat fragmentation depending on strain and sex. This was expected as the two strains and males and females had been previously shown to exhibit different space requirements. Core areas were, however, unaffected by fragmentation pattern at the spatial scale employed. The most pronounced and consistent responses to habitat fragmentation concerned movement rates for both sexes and the degree of space sharing between matrilineally related and unrelated females. The frequency of home range overlaps (irrespective of matrilineal relatedness and strain) was highest in the large-fragment plots and lowest in the small-fragment plots. The degree of overlap between matrilineally related females showed a reverse trend, however, indicating that space sharing was more directed towards kin in the most fragmented systems. The rate of interfragment movements increased with habitat fragmentation. Corridors induced more individuals to move between the smallest fragments. Males generally moved more frequently between fragments than did females. Our results match the hypothesis predicting fusion and fission responses based on intrinsic social mechanisms in patchy populations.

AB A recent study of the nitrogen budgets of pitch pines (Pinus rigida Mill.) and red pines (P. resinosa Ait.) growing in model ecosystems in New Hampshire (USA) reported very high nitrogen gains. Thus N-2, fixation associated with the rhizosphere of pines may contribute to their success in nitrogen-limited ecosystems. We used the acetylene-reduction assay with carbon monoxide controls to determine whether high rates of N-2 fixation are associated with pine forests in Maine. We measured nitrogenase activity in cores of the forest floor and the mineral soil beneath for five pitch pine, seven red pine, and six eastern white pine (P. strobus L.) stands. The stands represented 8 of the 15 biophysical regions of Maine (USA) and included a variety of age classes. We found only very low rates of nitrogenase activity, which varied seasonally with the highest values during the warmer months. The highest mean nitrogenase activity observed was 449 nmol C2H4 . m(-1). h(-1). We estimated that <6 mg N/m(2) was fixed annually by non-symbiotic diazotrophs in the soil horizons sampled. These rates are much smaller than atmospheric N inputs in Maine (300-450 mg N . m(-2). yr(-1)) and consequently have little impact on the N budgets of the pines. Based on our results and the literature, it is likely that only low rates of N-2 fixation are associated with pines.

AB Larvae of Phratora vitellinae (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) convert salicyl glucosides from the host plant into a larval defensive secretion with salicylaldehyde. This secretion repels generalist predators. Willows vary greatly in the concentrations of salicyl glucosides in their leaves. One may predict that P. vitellinae prefers and survives better on plants that contain more salicyl glucosides. We determined the amount of larval secretion, host preference, larval growth, and larval survival of P. vitellinae on Salix myrsinifolia, S. pentandra, and S. phylicifolia. We also measured feeding rates of three natural predators on P. vitellinae larvae feeding on different hosts. Salix pentandra and S. myrsinifolia contained substantial amounts of salicyl glucosides, but S. phylicifolia contained very little of them. Phratora vitellinae larvae produced more secretion on S. pentandra than on S. myrsinifolia. They produced little secretion on S. phylicifolia. Adult beetles preferred S. myrsinifolia over S. pentandra and S. pentandra over S. phylicifolia. Larvae grew most rapidly on S. myrsinifolia and S. pentandra. Their growth was slowest on S. phylicifolia. The larval survival was similar on S. myrsinifolia and S. phylicifolia, but it was significantly lower on S. pentandra. The natural predators fed equally well on P. vitellinae feeding on S. myrsinifolia and S. phylicifolia. Thus, the host preference of P. vitellinae did not correspond to larval survival on these hosts, but rather to larval growth. Larval survival of P. vitellinae was not related to the amount of defensive secretion. Natural predators were not repelled by the host-derived defensive secretion. We discuss the implications of these findings for the evolution of host plant use in this herbivore.

AB River otters (Lutra canadensis Schreber) inhabiting coastal environments scent-mark specific locations along the coast, known as latrine sites. In this study, we used stable isotope techniques to investigate the effects of this scent-marking behavior on terrestrial vegetation at the terrestrial-marine interface. Our analysis of stable isotope ratios of fur and feces indicated that river otters fed mainly on intertidal and subtidal fish. Eight different species of plants, growing in latrine sites of river otters, had significantly higher values of 6(15)N compared with the same plant species growing on nonlatrine sites. Elevated N concentrations occurred only in grasses and mosses growing in latrine sites. Our results indicate that, through their scent-marking behavior, coastal river otters transfer marine-derived nitrogen into the beach-fringe forest and thus fertilize the terrestrial vegetation in the terrestrial-marine interface.

AB Many organisms display patchiness in their distribution patterns over a wide range of spatial scales. Patchy distribution patterns can be caused by processes such as growth, migration, reproduction, and mortality, which result in neighboring areas being more likely to contain a species than distant areas, a phenomenon known as positive spatial autocorrelation. When species are patchily distributed, the within-species spatial randomness assumptions of the standard statistical tests for detecting species associations are seriously violated. Using these tests under such circumstances can lead to incorrect rejection of the null hypothesis. To address this problem we introduce a new test for detecting species associations-the random patterns test. This test takes into account spatial autocorrelation by including the characteristics of the spatial pattern of each species into the null model. A randomization procedure was used to generate the null distribution of the test statistic. The random patterns test is illustrated with data collected from an herbaceous understory community of a Eucalyptus forest near Canberra, Australia.

AB Competition for space among organisms on tropical reefs has often been hypothesized to be mediated by allelopathic interactions, but the secondary metabolites involved in these interactions have rarely been identified. On Guam, the sponge Dysidea sp. overgrows the sponge Cacospongia sp. and causes necrosis. Using field assays, we tested the effects of crude organic extracts and a major sesquiterpene isolated from Dysidea, 7-deacetoxyolepupuane, on Cacospongia and on the production of the major terpenoid metabolites scalaradial and desacetylscalaradial by Cacospongia. We also tested whether the amounts of organic compounds produced by Dysidea differed in the presence or absence of Cacospongia. To determine whether 7-deacetoxyolepupuane had another ecological function, we tested the compound as a predator deterrent. In field experiments, crude extracts of Dysidea and pure 7-deacetoxyolepupuane both caused necrosis in Cacospongia when they were incorporated into agar strips and placed in contact with Cacospongia for 7 d. Organic extract, scalaradial, and desacetylscalaradial concentrations in Cacospongia were not affected by the overgrowth of Dysidea. However, a greater quantity of organic extract (but not scalaradial or desacetylscalaradial) was found in portions of Cacospongia covered by agar strips containing Dysidea organic extracts than in portions of Cacospongia covered by control agar strips. The production of 7-deacetoxyolepupuane by Dysidea occurring on rock substrates and on Cacospongia did not differ; thus, the production of this compound is not induced by the presence of competitors. In addition to its role in competition, 7-deacetoxyolepupuane deterred predation by a spongivorous fish, illustrating the multiple ecological roles that a single secondary metabolite may play.

AB The ant species inhabiting 129 small Bahamian cays were surveyed annually over a 5-yr period. Stepwise multiple linear regression analyses revealed that plant species number was the best single predictor of ant species richness. Vegetated area or cay elevation (depending on the analysis) were second selected variables. Variation in the selected predictor variables explained 56.8-71.7% of the variation in ant species number. An "all-subsets" regression approach yielded similar results. Stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that the probability of occurrence of Dorymyrmex pyramicus was positively related to vegetated area and elevation, whereas that of Pheidole punctatissima was positively related to plant species number and distance. Species turnover was documented on 42% of the cays inhabited by ants over the course of the study. Mean annual relative turnover was low and variable, ranging from 0.83 to 22.37%/yr when calculated on a per-species basis, and from 2.13 to 5.70%/yr when calculated on a per-island basis. Sampling error was quantified, and pseudoturnover was found to inflate observed turnover for only one species (P. punctatissima). A comparison of immigration and extinction rates indicated the existence of a dynamic equilibrium between these two processes. The probabilities of immigration and extinction (pooled over all species) were both positively related to vegetation height. Observed turnover rates for ants were lower than those reported from other, more limited studies of insular ants and from studies of insular arthropods in general, and were more similar to documented vertebrate turnover rates. Incidence functions revealed that the three most common species, Brachymyrmex cf. obscurior, D. pyramicus, and P. punctatissima, displayed different patterns of distribution in relation to insular ant species richness.

AB Previous studies have shown that asynchronous hatching in birds tends to result in fewer, but higher quality, offspring than does synchronous hatching. However, very few studies have considered the consequences of such a pattern for the recruitment of offspring as subsequent breeders. We recorded nestling survival and fledgling body mass in experimentally synchronous and asynchronous broods of the Great Tit, Parus major. Using six different juvenile survival models, taken from published studies of the species, we calculated the expected number of offspring recruited with each hatching pattern and survival function. The sex of fledglings was included in the analysis. When comparing the estimates of surviving juveniles between synchronous and asynchronous broods, we found no significant difference in the means with any of the six models. However, the distributions of recruitment were different: the expected number of recruits was more variable with synchrony than with asynchrony. This suggests that hatching asynchrony in the Great Tit may serve as a bet-hedging strategy. A larger proportion of asynchronous broods than of the synchronous broods experienced brood reduction, but fledgling body masses for the reduced synchronous broods were lower than those for the reduced asynchronous broods. This suggests that synchronous hatching inhibits adaptive brood reduction in the Great Tit. There was considerable individual variation in the level of brood reduction within the same area and season. We argue that conditions also may be unpredictable at a small scale (parental abilities, territory quality, or parasite load). In consequence, high-quality parents may benefit from synchrony, but low-quality parents benefit from asynchrony, within the same year.

AB Flour beetles of the genus Tribolium are known for population dynamics characterized by periodic cycling in the abundance of egg and larval stages, along with stability of pupal and adult densities. Previous modeling efforts have suggested that these dynamics are internally driven by cannibalistic interactions among certain life stages. The current study examines empirically the role of cannibalism in generating the population dynamics. Populations of Tribolium confusum were physically manipulated by segregating certain stages in separate containers every four days, effectively creating a refuge from cannibalism. We experimentally manipulated rates of cannibalism of eggs and pupae by adults, and cannibalism of eggs by larvae. The stage-structured dynamics of 21 separate populations were observed for 284 d. Our results support the prediction that larval cannibalism of eggs was responsible for generating cycling among these stages. Egg cannibalism by adults tended to have a stabilizing role as did pupal cannibalism by adults. Adult densities were controlled primarily by pupal cannibalism, and in its absence adult population growth approached exponential. These experiments provide a direct test of the role of cannibalism in a long-term study of population dynamics.

AB Effectiveness of nitrate (NO3-) and phosphate (P) uptake in a patchy nutrient environment by tussocks of Agropyron desertorum (crested wheatgrass) was assessed with simulations using existing nutrient-uptake models parameterized with field data. Simulations conducted with Monte Carlo techniques were used to expose roots to different levels of nutrient variability with numbers of patches set at 10 large or 1000 small patches over the rooting zone of a single tussock. With constant uptake kinetics, simulated whole-plant uptake of both NO3- and P by established or growing roots was highest in soils with the nutrients distributed uniformly but declined with increasing soil nutrient variability for both nutrients. The decline was greater for NO3- than for P and was greater for both ions in soils with nutrients distributed in the 10 large patches. The reduction in predicted nutrient uptake with increasing variability was more pronounced with higher mean concentrations of P, while mean concentration had little effect on the pattern of NO3- uptake. However, allowing increased uptake kinetics with increasing nutrient concentration, as measured earlier for Agropyron desertorum, indicated that changes in kinetics could offset the lower whole-plant uptake rates in soils with patchy nutrient distributions.
   The effects of soil moisture and root distribution on whole-plant uptake of NO3- and P were also simulated. With constant kinetics, nutrient uptake in drier soil with uniformly distributed soil moisture was less affected by patchy nutrient distributions than was nutrient uptake in moister soil. Benefits associated with enhanced uptake kinetics with patchy nutrients distributions were reduced in drier soils for NO3-, but were similar for P. Variability in soil moisture had little effect on patterns of P and NO3- uptake. Differences in distributions of distances between fine roots had little influence on the patterns of NO3- and P uptake.

AB Species in community food webs are commonly aggregated or lumped on the basis of overlap in predators and prey. This note reports an unexpected result of lumping species in observed food webs and simulated food webs. The main result is that it is much easier to lump species in observed webs than in simulated webs. The reason is that there is much more overlap in predators and prey for species in observed webs than in simulated webs. This points to a fundamental deficiency in web assembly models that assume a random distribution of links.

AB The water sources used by epiphytic, hemiepiphytic, and arborescent life stages of Didymopanax pittieri were investigated in the tropical cloud forest reserve at Monteverde, Costa Rica. Each life stage was hypothesized to obtain its water from a different location because of differences in terms of where each stage placed its roots. Stable hydrogen isotope analyses of source and plant water samples confirmed that when plants were epiphytic they used water from canopy mars and from occult precipitation (mist, cloud water, and fog) while the arborescent life stage used only water in the soil from recent rainfall; the hemiepiphytic life stage used a mixture of these different water sources. These data demonstrate that along with changes in the life stage of this plant species come changes in its patterns of resource utilization. The generality of this finding for other tropical hemiepiphytes needs to be investigated.

AB We analyzed three models of tritrophic interactions among hosts, parasitoids, and hyperparasitoids. In their deterministic versions, all models can produce dynamics in the form of a torus, in which there are both short-term cycles and long-term cycles of tens or hundreds of generations. To investigate whether similar long-term patterns can occur when there is environmental variability, we produced stochastic versions of the three models. Long-term population fluctuations occurred over a wider range of parameter values in the stochastic models than in the deterministic models. This suggests that long-term population fluctuations are plausible features of natural tritrophic systems. We use this example to argue that characterizing nonlinearities should not be the sole objective when analyzing stochastic population dynamics. The long-term dynamical patterns produced by our stochastic models can be investigated using linear techniques to quantify the patterns of density dependence in the multispecies system. These techniques identify long-term patterns as near-random-walk dynamics occurring concomitantly with short-term quasi-cyclic dynamics in the three-dimensional three-species system. Interpreting stochastic population dynamics in terms of patterns of density dependence makes it possible to identify the potential for long-term population fluctuations in the absence of very long-term data sets.

AB Microhabitat preferences are assumed to be adaptive, suggesting that fitness is higher in preferred microhabitats and potentially reflecting natural selection on habitat choices. I examined microhabitat preferences and adaptiveness of preferences for seven bird species coexisting in high elevation snowmelt drainages based on study of microhabitat and survival of 1556 nests. Habitat features in the nest patch differed from both random and non-use (sites centered on the same plant species as used for the nest) sites within each bird species, indicating nonrandom nest site choice. Bird species within a nesting guild (ground, shrub) also differed from each other based on the same vegetation features that differentiated nest sites from non-use and random sites, and this vegetation feature dominated the microhabitat type that was used most frequently by each species. In short, frequency of use of dominant vegetation types, comparisons of nest vs. random and nonuse sites, and comparisons among species were concordant in their indications of microhabitat preferences. The frequency in use of microhabitats was taken as an unambiguous measure of microhabitat preference within this study system: vegetation varied along a short microclimate gradient in the study system and territories of birds encompassed the entire gradient, thereby making all microhabitats available within the territory of each individual, such that use reflected a clear choice among alternatives. Microhabitat preferences differed among species and reflected differing positions on the microclimate gradient. Thus, species partitioned either microhabitat or microclimate within each nesting guild. Nest success was greater at preferred than at nonpreferred microhabitats for all seven species, indicating that preferences were adaptive. Examination of cubic spline curves and standardized directional selection differentials (s) and selection gradients (beta) indicated that preferences had positive directional selection coefficients. These selection coefficients suggested that selection might be acting to favor preferences, but information on genetic bases of habitat choices is needed before selection can be ascertained. Advances in understanding evolution of habitat preferences depend on an individual-level examination of habitat choices and their fitness consequences, and also examination of the phenotypic traits and mechanisms that underlie habitat-induced variation in fitness components.

AB Does grazing by large wild mammals, an intense form of aboveground herbivory, influence belowground productivity? The vast majority of literature data concentrate on short-term pot studies and indicate that clipping consistently retards root growth. Field studies are few and contradictory, but tend to indicate that grazing has little effect on grassland belowground production. We sampled root-soil cores at 0-10 and 10-20 cm increments, at 11 locations across the Serengeti ecosystem, on 10 dates over an annual cycle, sampling monthly during the rainy and early dry seasons and every 2 mo during peak dry season. Fenced and unfenced plots were replicated (n = 2 or 3) at each location. Live roots, identified visually by brightness and texture, were sorted, washed, dried, and weighed. In addition, profiles were sampled at 10-cm increments to 50 cm in fenced and unfenced plots in short, mid-height, and tall grasslands, representing a gradient of grazing, during the month of peak root biomass. Exclosures erected 22-25 yr previously were similarly sampled in short and tall grasslands to a 30-cm depth.
   Root biomass reached a pronounced minimum in mid-wet season (February) and a decided maximum at the beginning of the dry season (June). Net productivity, based on maximum-minimum biomass, ranged from 100 to 600 g.m(-2).yr(-1) to a 20-cm depth, with minima ranging from 40 to 150 g/m(2) and maxima from 230 to 700 g/m(2), according to location. There was no evidence that grazing reduced root productivity over the annual cycle. Vertical biomass profiles at peak standing crop were similar for short, mid-height, and tall grasslands, with root biomass dropping sharply with depth, except for short grasslands on soils that, atypically, lack a hardpan. In those grasslands, shallow root biomass was lower than in other grasslands, but biomass at depth was distinctly greater. For longterm protected grasslands, root biomasses at peak were identical in short grasslands, whether fenced or unfenced, but fenced tall grasslands had a lower root biomass than grazed plots. We conclude that intense herbivory does not inhibit root biomass or belowground productivity of Serengeti grasslands over either the short or the long term.

AB We tested whether compounds in ripe Solanum americanum fruits affect gut retention time of S. americanum seeds in Cedar Waxwings (Bombycilla cedrorum). Glycoalkaloids were of special interest because they commonly occur in ripe Solanum fruits and are associated with diarrhea in humans. Also, we determined the influence of gut retention time and the presence/absence of two glycoalkaloids, alpha-solasonine and alpha-solamargine, on germination of S. americanum seeds. In one trial, we measured seed retention times of 10 waxwings fed three types of artificial fruits, Control (containing no secondary metabolites), Low Concentration (containing low concentrations of a-solasonine and alpha-solamargine, matching those in ripe S. americanum fruit), and Extract (containing an ethanol extract of ripe S. americanum fruits, with many unidentified secondary metabolites). Seeds in Low Concentration fruits were not defecated more quickly than those in Control fruits, but seeds in Extract fruits were. Thus, ripe S. americanum fruits contain a chemical or chemicals with a laxative effect. Also, seeds from Control fruits were deposited in more defecations and at lower densities in each defecation than those from Extract fruits. In a second trial, we compared retention times of seeds in control fruits and in fruits with high concentrations of glycoalkaloids, typical in ripe fruits of other Solanum species. These high concentrations had a significant constipative effect on seed passage. Percentage germination and mean germination time of defecated seeds were not influenced by mean retention time in waxwing guts. However, proportionately fewer seeds germinated from Low Concentration fruits than from Control fruits. These results suggest that plants have more control over seed processing by frugivores than generally acknowledged. Secondary metabolites in ripe fruits can increase or decrease retention time and thereby influence seed deposition patterns (e.g., number of defecations with seeds, number of seeds per defecation, and presumably, dispersal distance).

AB We studied resource allocation between sexual reproduction and clonal propagation in a perennial stoloniferous clonal plant, Potentilla anserina, an obligate outcrosser. We manipulated reproductive effort of Potentilla anserina either by hand-pollinating all flowers or by preventing pollination. To test the effect of resource-limiting conditions on resource allocation and reproductive output, we used a control and two levels of heavy metals (copper and nickel) to limit plant growth. The experiment was conducted as a 2 x 3 factorial design to reveal possible interactions between reproductive manipulation and resource limitation. Heavy metals decreased the total biomass of the plants and number of flowers and ramets produced. Only 50% of the plants grown with the higher level of heavy metals produced flowers. Pollination treatment interacted significantly with the heavy-metal treatment. In the metal control (no metals added) and lower heavy-metal treatment, there were no significant differences in total vegetative biomass between the two pollination treatments. Costs of reproduction in terms of subsequent flowering in the later season appeared to be clear, because the number of flowers per whole plant was lower if the plants were hand-pollinated and because the proportion of flowering ramets decreased due to hand-pollination. However, flowering may also be partly hormonally controlled. In contrast, hand-pollinated plants exposed to high concentrations of heavy metals tended to have greater biomass of vegetative plant structures and higher number of flowers compared to nonpollinated plants. Together, these results suggest that environmental factors may alter costs of reproduction but do not support the idea that these costs are more acute in resource (photosynthate)-limiting conditions.

AB Juvenile pollock (Pollachius virens) school in open water at low tide and disperse in beds of intertidal algae at high tide. The goal of the present study was to determine whether both aggregation and use of algal habitat represent alternative antipredator tactics for pollock, and whether their occurrence depended on the number of fish present and the amount of algal habitat available. We systematically varied fish density and algal availability in large (8-m(2)) arenas and examined distributions before and after exposure to an avian predator model, a stuffed cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus). Pollock preferred the algal habitat, and the proportion of fish in the algae increased as the amount of algal habitat increased. When density of fish in the arena increased, the number of fish in the algal habitat increased, but the proportion decreased. Following exposure to the predator model, the proportion of fish in the algae increased. Fish in the open were aggregated most of the time, but there was a trend toward increased aggregation of those fish remaining in the open following exposure to the predator. Thus, the use of two alternative antipredator tactics can produce very dynamic spatial distributions. Because the benefits of aggregations are positively density dependent while those of refuges are likely negatively density dependent, species that use both tactics are likely to show dramatic shifts in habitat distribution with changes in population size and refuge availability.

AB We analyzed how the distribution and abundance of a major consumer, the coyote (Canis latrans) is influenced by the input of food from the sea. In the arid deserts of Baja California, coyote abundance along the shore of the Gulf of California is much higher compared to adjacent inland areas. These high densities are achieved because coastal coyotes are subsidized by the Bow of abundant and diverse resources that come directly and indirectly from the ocean. Analysis of seats between coastal and inland sites indicates that the diet breadth of coastal coyotes is expanded (i.e., more food types were eaten) and that much more food is consumed by individuals and populations of coyotes in coastal regions. On average, seat mass at coastal sites is more than double that at inland sites. An average of 47.8% of all items found in coastal seats come directly from the sea. Such allochthonous input facilitates a numerical response: each of our four measures of coyote abundance shows that coyotes are significantly more dense along the coast than inland. Coyote populations on the coast are 2.4-13.7 times more dense than in adjacent inland areas that do not receive marine input. We present data from the literature to suggest that the use of marine resources by carnivorous mammals is widespread worldwide.

AB There is much interest in biogeochemical processes that occur at the interface between soils and streams since, at the scale of landscapes, these habitats may function as control points for fluxes of nitrogen (N) and other nutrients from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems. Here we examine whether a thermodynamic perspective can enhance our mechanistic and predictive understanding of the biogeochemical function of soil-stream interfaces, by considering how microbial communities interact with variations in supplies of electron donors and accepters. Over a two-year period we analyzed >1400 individual samples of subsurface waters from networks of sample wells in riparian wetlands along Smith Creek, a first-order stream draining a mixed forested-agricultural landscape in southwestern Michigan, USA. We focused on areas where soil water and ground water emerged into the stream, and where we could characterize subsurface flow paths by measures of hydraulic head and/or by in situ additions of hydrologic tracers. We found strong support for the idea that the biogeochemical function of soil-stream interfaces is a predictable outcome of the interaction between microbial communities and supplies of electron donors and accepters. Variations in key electron donors and accepters (NO(3)(-), N(2)O, NH(4)(+), SO(4)(2-), CH(4), and dissolved organic carbon [DOC]) closely followed predictions from thermodynamic theory. Transformations of N and other elements resulted from the response of microbial communities to two dominant hydrologic flow paths: (1) horizontal flow of shallow subsurface waters with high levels of electron donors (i.e., DOG, CH(4), and NH(4)(+)), and (2) near-stream vertical upwelling of deep subsurface waters with high levels of energetically favorable electron accepters (i.e., NO(3)(-), N(2)O, and SO(4)(2-)). Our results support the popular notion that soil-stream interfaces can possess strong potential for removing dissolved N by denitrification. Yet in contrast to prevailing ideas, we found that denitrification did not consume all NO(3)(-) that reached the soil-stream interface via subsurface flow paths. Analyses of subsurface N chemistry and natural abundances of delta(15)N in NO(3)(-) and NH(4)(+) suggested a narrow near-stream region as functionally the most important location for NO(3)(-) consumption by denitrification. This region was characterized by high throughput of terrestrially derived water, by accumulation of dissolved NO(3)(-) and N(2)O, and by low levels of DOG. Field experiments supported our hypothesis that the sustained ability for removal of dissolved NO(3)(-) and N(2)O should be limited by supplies of oxidizable carbon via shallow flowpaths. In situ additions of acetate, succinate, and propionate induced rates of NO(3)(-) removal (similar to 1.8 g N.m(-2).d(-1)) that were orders of magnitude greater than typically reported from riparian habitats. We propose that the immediate near-stream region may be especially important for determining the landscape-level function of many riparian wetlands, Management efforts to optimize the removal of NO(3)(-) by denitrification ought to consider promoting natural inputs of oxidizable carbon to this near-stream region.

AB This article reviews literature and summarizes experiments to investigate the extent lu which productivity of tropical montane rain forests is constrained by low nutrient supply, On any one mountain, with increase in altitude foliar N decreases, and P and K usually decrease, but Ca and Rig show no consistent trend. However for a wide range of sites N P, K, Mg, and Ca show no trends. Litterfall contents of N and P and often K, Ca, and Mg are lower in montane forests than in lowland forests, mainly because of reduced litterfall mass, but N and P concentrations are also lower in forests above 1500 m. Tropical montane soils usually have more soil organic matter per unit ground area; N mineralization levels are lower at higher altitudes in Costa Rica, and extractable and total soil P are lower in sites with lower litterfall P concentration. We speculate that many lowland forests are limited by P and manu montane forests by N.
   Fertilization studies on ash-derived montane soils in Hawaii showed a trend for a switch from N limitation on young soils to P, or N and P, limitation on soils over older substrates. Jamaican montane trees were limited by N and by P separately. Venezuelan montane trees were limited by N. The sites in Jamaica and Venezuela have soils of indeterminate age. Taken together these results show that nutrient limitation is widespread in montane soils (all sites have responded to at least one nutrient) and that the particular nutrient(s) that limit(s) production may differ for explicable reasons, First results from lowland forests on sandy soils in Kalimantan show N or simultaneous N and P limitation. Many more experiments, especially in lowland forests, are needed to test our speculation that P usually limits productivity in tropical lowland rain forests and that N limits productivity in tropical montane rain forests.

AB We conducted a field experiment in a successional grassland to investigate the short-term effects of nitrogen enrichment and plant litter on plant species richness and on the establishment of a native grass (Andropogon gerardi) that was experimentally introduced to the study site as seed. Additions of nitrogen fertilizer to experimental plots over two growing seasons increased plant production as indicated by increases in both living plant biomass and litter biomass. Increased productivity reduced species richness by effectively preventing the seedling establishment of the subordinate forb species and reduced the recruitment of Andropogon gerardi by inhibiting both germination and survival. Litter removals carried out at each of two levels of nitrogen enrichment (no nitrogen, nitrogen added) showed that litter significantly reduced species richness by the same amount in fertilized and unfertilized plots, suggesting that living biomass and litter were purely additive, rather than interactive in their effects. In contrast, the results of litter additions suggested that the declines in richness associated with fertilization could largely be due to the suppressive effects of increased litter biomass alone. As a whole, the results indicate that litter and living biomass are largely substitutable in their inhibitory effects on species richness in highly productive successional grasslands due to their independent and equivalent capacities to attenuate light to very low levels. This study highlights the combined roles of competition and plant litter in influencing the diversity of grasslands through effects on seedling establishment.

AB Habitat selection is a crucial process in the life cycle of animals because it can affect most components of fitness. It has been proposed that some animals cue on the reproductive success of conspecifics to select breeding habitats. We tested this hypothesis with demographic and behavioral data from a 17-yr study of the Black-legged Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), a cliff-nesting seabird. As the hypothesis assumes, the Black-legged Kittiwake nesting environment was patchy, and the relative quality of the different patches (i.e., breeding cliffs) varied in time. The average reproductive success of the breeders of a given cliff was predictable from one year to the next, but this predictability faded after several years. The dynamic nature of cliff quality in the long term is partly explained by the autocorrelation of the prevalence of an ectoparasite that influences reproductive success. As predicted by the performance-based conspecific attraction hypothesis, the reproductive success of current breeders on a given cliff was predictive of the reproductive success of new recruits on the cliff in the following year. Breeders tended to recruit to the previous year's most productive cliffs and to emigrate from the least productive ones. Consequently, the dynamics of breeder numbers on the cliffs were explained by local reproductive success on a year-to-year basis. Because, on average, young Black-legged Kittiwakes first breed when 4 yr old, such a relationship probably results from individual choices based on the assessment of previous-year local quality. When breeders changed breeding cliffs between years, they selected cliffs of per capita higher reproductive success. Furthermore, after accounting for the potential effects of age and sex as well as between-year variations, the effect of individual breeding performance on breeding dispersal was strongly influenced by the average reproductive success of other breeders on the same cliff. Individual breeding performance did not appear to influence the probability of dispersing for birds breeding on cliffs with high local reproductive success, whereas individual breeding performance did have a strong effect on dispersal for birds that bred on cliffs with lower local reproductive success. This suggests that the reproductive success of locally breeding conspecifics may be sufficient to override an individual's own breeding experience when deciding whether to emigrate. These results, which are supported by behavioral observations of the role of prospecting in recruitment, suggest that both first breeders and adults rely on the reproductive success of conspecifics as "public information" to assess their own chances of breeding successfully in a given patch and to make settling decisions. A corollary prediction is that individuals should attempt to breed near successful conspecifics (a form of social attraction) in order to benefit from the same favorable local environmental conditions. Such a performance-based conspecific attraction mechanism can thus lead to an aggregative distribution of nests and may have played a role in the evolution of coloniality.

AB We examined the response of montane butterflies to a 1300-m elevational gradient in the Toiyabe Range, a mountain range in the central Great Basin. We tested whether elevational ranges of montane butterflies conform to Rapoport's elevational rule (species at higher elevations have greater elevational ranges). We also tested whether the Rapoport-rescue hypothesis (emigrants from higher elevation populations inflate the species richness of lower-elevation sites) could explain the species richness patterns we observed. In addition, we predicted whether global climate change is likely to perturb current elevational gradients in butterfly species richness. Species presence data were collected from 105 100-m vertical elevational bands in 17 canyons. Elevation and species richness were significantly negatively correlated, although species richness peaked at intermediate elevations, and butterflies in species-rich areas had significantly narrower elevational ranges than species in more depauperate areas. Toiyabe Range butterflies conformed to Rapoport's elevational rule. The Rapoport effect we documented did not result from sampling bias. However, the Rapoport-rescue hypothesis cannot fully explain the elevational gradient in species richness. Environmental severity at either end and favorable conditions near the middle of the elevational gradient likely contributed to high species richness at intermediate elevations. Our models indicated that few butterfly taxa will be lost from the Toiyabe Range in the face of climate change. To maintain present species richness and maximize the potential of Great Basin butterflies to adapt to rapid climate change, we recommend that habitat protection and restoration efforts target not only high elevation Wilderness Areas but also intermediate elevations.

AB Simple theories of predator-prey population dynamics predict that enrichment of the prey will reduce population stability and cause complex dynamics such as population cycles. This "paradox of enrichment" has rarely been tested, although it has been observed in laboratory populations of mites and protozoans. In this paper, replicated laboratory microcosms containing planktonic rotifer predators and phytoplankton prey were used to explore the effects of enrichment on predator population dynamics. Prey enrichment was accomplished by increasing the input concentration of prey into predator chemostat flasks, which is equivalent to increasing prey carrying capacity and growth rate. Enrichment stabilized predator dynamics, reducing population variability and reducing the occurrence and strength of population cycles. This is the first experimental demonstration of a reversal of the paradox of enrichment. Rotifers produced an autotoxic compound that reduced population growth rate and individual survival. Since predators were more abundant in the enriched microcosms, dynamics may have been stabilized by a toxin-mediated density-dependent death rate. These results support recent theories suggesting that predator density dependence can result in stabilization by enrichment and may help explain the scarcity of examples of the paradox of enrichment in nature.

AB Because the quantity, quality, and heterogeneity of resources should affect the diversity of consumers, plant productivity, plant composition, and plant diversity may influence the diversity of trophic levels higher up the food chain ("bottom-up" control of diversity). Increasing plant productivity may increase herbivore diversity by: increasing the abundance of rare resources ("resource rarity hypothesis"), increasing herbivore abundance and local persistence ("consumer rarity hypothesis") or increasing intraspecific density dependence ("density dependence hypothesis"). Increasing plant diversity may increase the diversity of herbivores because herbivores specialized on these new plant species can persist locally. Increasing the diversity of herbivores could likewise increase the diversity of predators and parasites, although parasite and predator diversity may also respond directly to changes in vegetation. Here I use data from a well-replicated grassland experiment at Cedar Creek, Minnesota, to analyze the responses of arthropod diversity to independent manipulations of (1) plant productivity and (2) plant diversity and composition. Long-term nitrogen addition ("historical treatment") decreased plant diversity and favored C-3 grasses. Short-term nitrogen addition ("modern treatment") increased plant productivity without appreciably changing plant diversity or plant composition. Arthropods were sampled using both sweep nets and vacuum samplers.
   Total arthropod species richness and abundance, as well as species richness and abundance of every trophic group (detritivores, herbivores, parasites, and predators), were significantly greater in plots with higher levels of modern fertilization and greater plant productivity. Path analysis supported the consumer rarity hypothesis, because modern fertilization increased herbivore species richness only indirectly by increasing herbivore abundance. Surprisingly, higher levels of historical fertilization that lowered plant species richness (but did not change plant productivity) significantly increased total arthropod species richness, did not affect detritivore or herbivore species richness, and significantly increased parasite and predator species richness. Direct and indirect effects of historical fertilization on the species richness of trophic groups were separated statistically using block regression chain modeling. Herbivore species richness was decreased through the direct pathway, but this was offset through indirect effects so that there was no overall response to historical fertilization. In plots with low plant diversity, similar numbers of herbivore species supported a greater diversity of parasites and predators. These results suggest that the diversity and composition of plants control the diversity of consumers not only directly by determining available resources, but also indirectly by influencing the interactions between herbivores and their parasites and predators.

AB The analysis of plant competition experiments with variable plant density is discussed based on three published data sets. It is shown how conclusions regarding plant community dynamics from typical plant competition experiments can be extended and based on a statistical framework. The data are tested in hyperbolic competition models of decreasing complexity by a standard hierarchical statistical procedure. Hypotheses on the shape of the response surface curves, the number of necessary parameters, and the effects of competition on plant growth were tested using maximum likelihood ratio tests. The conditions for coexistence in a hyperbolic competition model were examined analytically. Using the found conditions for coexistence and Bayesian statistics, the probability of the four possible outcomes of two-species competition was estimated in a competition experiment with Avena fatua and A. barbata.

AB Species responses to disturbance (mortality of dominant individuals within a community) influence many aspects of that ecological community. To trace the responses of vegetation to one particular type of disturbance, I sampled vegetation in 250 canopy gaps in 1976/1977, 1983, and 1990/1991. These gaps were located in three sites in the southern Appalachians of eastern North America: Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Walker Cove Research Natural Area, and Joyce Kilmer Wilderness Area. Each gap was sampled thrice for sapling composition (stems greater than or equal to 1 cm in diameter at breast height). Additional measurements included the extension growth of border trees into the gap, recent mortality rates of border trees, deterioration rates of gas makers that had been standing dead in earlier samples, and the composition of understory plots.
   The mean extension (branch) growth of border trees was 12 cm/yr, with slower growth by longer branches. Gap makers that had been tall stumps tended to deteriorate, although 35% stayed intact over the 14 yr of the study. Border-tree mortality averaged 0.60%/yr, with higher rates for larger stems and with much interspecific variation.
   Stem density of saplings in gaps increased during the first sampling interval and decreased during the second as self-thinning counteracted increased establishment. Basal area increased during both sampling intervals. The death of border trees increased basal area per unit gap area.
   The four main species (Acer saccharum, Tsuga canadensis, Fagus grandifolia, and Halesia carolina) showed different patterns of correlation to gap size and age. Species in general showed more correlations with gap age for the first sample than afterwards; gap size was more consistently related to species importance. Species patterns also were affected by the presence or absence of border-tree mortality. The stands studied seem nearly at equilibrium. Some small changes are likely to occur, but the species present dominated all size classes: gap saplings, border trees, other canopy trees not related to gaps, and understory saplings. Species differed in their relative growth rates in the understory and in gaps of different sizes. Species also differed in their survival rates in the understory and in the canopy.

AB In this study, I examined the impacts of a presumed central-place forager on its prey and on the prey's resource. Western fence lizards, Sceloporus occidentalis, limit their activity and feeding in meadows to a variety of structures (e.g., stumps, logs; brush, and rock piles). The impact of lizards on their primary prey, grasshoppers, decreased at a decreasing rate with distance from structures that housed lizards; thus, grasshopper densities increased with distance. Consequently, the abundance of plants (grasshoppers' food) decreased with distance from these structures. However, the relative abundance of plants varied with distance. The proportion of herbaceous forbs (the grasshoppers' preferred resource) was greatest near lizard structures, whereas the proportion of less edible grasses was greater far from lizard structures. There were no such relationships between grasshoppers or plants and distance from similar structures that did not house lizards. Near the structure, an exclosure experiment showed a very strong impact of lizards on grasshopper populations. Plant biomass and the relative proportion of forbs were higher with lizards present than in lizard exclosures, suggesting a trophic cascade. An identical exclosure experiment far (15 m) from the structure, where lizard activity was greatly reduced, showed no such cascades. Thus, this study showed evidence for strong consumer effects in a grassland system. However, small-scale differences in foraging behaviors (possibly due to predation risk) may importantly affect the outcomes of these interactions.

AB I compiled information from the literature on 140 population outbreaks of 26 species of forest Lepidoptera that occurred between the years 1932 and 1992 in the Northern Hemisphere, including Asia, North America, and Europe. Considerable variation in the number of outbreaks occurred among years, with a tendency for outbreaks to be synchronous. Years of numerous outbreaks include 1948, 1956, 1964, the mid-1970s, and the mid-1980s. Published summaries of weather in the Northern Hemisphere indicate the occurrence of above-normal precipitation and cool temperatures between 1954 and 1957, and a high proportion of populations were at peak density in 1954 and 1956. Cool springs in 1964, 1965, and 1976 were also associated with outbreaks in a number of species of forest Lepidoptera. Periods of synchrony of population outbreaks and cool temperatures appear to be associated with troughs in the sunspot cycle. While the details of population dynamics of caterpillars are determined through endogenous processes that influence fecundity and mortality, exogenous forces, such as cool springs, may occasionally play a role in synchronizing populations in the Northern Hemisphere. Thus weather conditions may act as a Moran effect and synchronize fluctuating populations of forest caterpillars over large geographic areas.

AB Natural hybridization between previously allopatric plant species can produce highly successful lineages. However, the ecological processes controlling the spread of hybrid genotypes have rarely been studied in the field. We compared fruit characteristics, fruit preference, and seed dispersal by native frugivores among the non-indigenous succulent Carpobrotus edulis, the putative native congener C. chilensis, and the hybrids resulting from introgressive hybridization. In this system, the non-native C. edulis and hybrids are known to be very successful invaders of California coastal plant communities. Carpobrotus edulis and hybrids produced more fruits per clone than C. chilensis, primarily as a consequence of larger clone size. Clone size and energy content of fruits were good predictors of fruit removal. Marked fruits of C. edulis and hybrids were removed faster than those of the other morphotypes, and C. edulis fruits were preferred over those of C. chilensis in a fruit transplant experiment. However, total fruit removal by the end of the growing season was very high for all morphotypes. Seats from black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), the most common frugivores in our sites, contained more seeds from C. edulis and hybrid morphotypes than from C. chilensis, and more than would be expected based on relative fruit abundance. Germination of seeds from C. edulis and hybrids was enhanced after gut passage, whereas germination of C. chilensis decreased after gut passage, compared to seed germination from intact fruits. The results suggest that patterns of fruit preference by native frugivores and seed survival after gut passage facilitate the successful spread of an aggressive introduced species and hybrids in contrast to the less aggressive, apparently native congener.

AB To test the hypothesis that the impacts of grazers on plant species richness reverse under contrasting nutrient richness, we analyzed unpublished and published data from lake, stream, marine, grassland, and forest ecosystems. We analyzed data from 30 studies providing 44 comparisons of plant species richness under low vs. high grazing pressure in enriched or nutrient-rich and non-enriched or nutrient-poor ecosystems. All 19 comparisons from non-enriched or nutrient-poor ecosystems exhibited significantly lower species richness under high grazing than under low grazing. In contrast, 14 of 25 comparisons from enriched or nutrient-rich ecosystems showed significantly higher species richness under high grazing than under low grazing. However, nine of these 25 comparisons showed no significant impact of grazers on species richness, while two comparisons showed declines in species richness under high grazing. Based on all the comparisons, plant species richness decreases with high grazing in nutrient-poor ecosystems, while it increases with high grazing in nutrient-rich ecosystems. Although nutrient-rich ecosystems seemed to produce more variable responses to grazers than did nutrient-poor ecosystems, in rare cases high grazing produced a decline in species richness in nutrient-rich environments. We suggest that species richness declines with high grazing in nutrient-poor ecosystems because a limitation of available resources prevents regrowth of species after grazing, which may not be the case in nutrient-rich ecosystems. It is also possible that an increase in species richness under high grazing in nutrient-rich ecosystems may be due to an increase in the dominance of inedible species. Our observation of a grazer reversal of plant species richness under contrasting nutrient richness may have important implications for management of species diversity.

AB Within large grassland ecosystems, climatic and topographic gradients are considered the primary controls of soil processes. Ungulates also can influence soil dynamics; however the relative contribution of large herbivores to controlling grassland soil processes remains largely unknown. In this study, we compared the effects of native migratory ungulates and variable site ("landscape") conditions, caused by combined climatic and topographic variability, on grassland of the northern winter range of Yellowstone National Park by determining soil C and N dynamics inside and outside 33-37 yr exclosures at seven diverse sites. Sites included hilltop, slope, and slope bottom positions across a climatic gradient and represented among the driest and wettest grasslands on the northern winter range. We performed two experiments: (1) a 12-mo in situ net N mineralization study and (2) a long-term (62-wk) laboratory incubation to measure potential N mineralization and microbial respiration.
   Results from the in situ experiment indicated that average net N mineralization among grazed plots (3.8 g N . m(-2).yr(-1)) was double that of fenced, ungrazed plots (1.9 g N . m(-2).yr(-1)). Mean grazer enhancement of net N mineralization across sites (1.9 g N . m(-2).yr(-1)) approached the maximum difference in net N mineralization among fenced plots (2.2 g N . m(-2).yr(-1)), i.e., the greatest landscape effect observed. Furthermore, ungulates substantially increased between-site variation in mineralization; grazed grassland, 1 SD = 2.2 g N . m(-2).yr(-1), fenced grassland, 1 so = 0.85 g N . m(-2).yr(-1).
   In the long-term incubation, potential microbial respiration and net N mineralization were positively related to total soil C and N content, respectively. There was greater variation in potential respiration and net N mineralization early in the incubation, when labile material was processed, compared to late in the incubation, when more recalcitrant substrate was processed, suggesting that between-site variation in labile organic matter was greater than that of recalcitrant material. Herbivores improved the organic matter quality of soil, increasing the labile fractions and reducing the recalcitrant fractions. Grazers reduced C respired/N mineralized ratios, an index of microbial N immobilization, by an average of 21%. However, the largest landscape influence on the immobilization index was 13-fold greater than the grazer effect. Given that the greatest landscape influence on in situ net mineralization (2.2 g N . m(-2).yr(-1)) was similar to the average grazer impact on that rate(1.9 g N . m(-2).yr(-1)), we hypothesize that the landscape effect on field N availability was primarily caused by variation in microbial immobilization, while the grazing effect was primarily due to stimulation of gross mineralization. These results indicate that the relative importance of ungulates in controlling soil N cycling may be more important than previously suspected for grasslands supporting large herds of migratory ungulates, and that the dominant mechanisms underlying the landscape and ungulate influences on soil mineral fluxes may differ.

AB A demographic analysis of the life-cycle graph can be used to quantify the separate contributions of different life-history types to the population growth rate. Loop analysis has been proposed (van Groenendael et al. 1994) as the appropriate method for partitioning the elasticity matrix to determine these contributions. However, in the analysis of complex demographic models it is difficult to derive the loops by simple inspection of the life-cycle graph. I show how graph theory can be used to describe a general and systematic procedure for deriving the loops from the structure of the life-cycle graph. I demonstrate that the concept of nullity (from graph theory) can be applied in this context to correctly determine the number of loops for any graph. Using examples from Campanula americana, Dipsacus sylvestris, and Caretta caretta, I illustrate the relationship of the loops to biologically relevant life-history contrasts. This relationship is crucial for the application of loop analysis to life-history evolution for the purpose of partitioning the separate effects on the population growth rate among different life-history components.

AB The survival and quality of progeny can be strongly influenced by nongenetic effects derived from the physiological condition of the mother during gametogenesis. The influence of maternal condition on the size and quality of larvae at dispersal was examined for the tropical damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, through a series of field studies during 1994. In this species, males guard a demersal nest of eggs contributed to by nearby females. The largest and most dominant female stays near the nest and contributes most to the egg clutches, limiting egg contributions from subordinate females. Maternal effects dramatically influenced the size of larval progeny at hatching, four days after laying. Much of the variability in progeny size was explained by levels of the stress-associated steroid hormone, cortisol, in the female. A field experiment manipulating maternal levels of cortisol found that cortisol levels strongly influenced the morphology and yolk size of larval progeny at hatching. Variation in the density of egg predators and competitors together explained 38% of the observed variance in maternal cortisol levels. These competitors and predatory fish appear to elevate maternal cortisol levels and consequently influence larval morphology through a stress-related response. This study suggests that the behavioral interaction regime of a fish population can determine larval quality and potentially govern a female's contribution to the next generation.

AB It is known that turtle embryos are prone to high rates of predation; however, little is known about microhabitat variation at the nest site and its effects on turtle embryo survival. Microhabitat characteristics were measured at nest sites of the striped mud turtle, Kinosternon baurii, on a sandhill in central Florida to determine whether females were choosing sites to oviposit their eggs that differed in vegetation structure from random sites. Also nests were experimentally manipulated in the field to determine whether survivorship of striped mud turtle embryos differed between nest sites and random sites.
   Female striped mud turtles selected sites to oviposit their eggs that differed from random. Nest sites were located closer to grass tussocks or other herbaceous vegetation and in areas of less bare ground than random sites. Soil at nonselected sites reached higher daily temperatures and maintained these higher temperatures for longer periods of time than soil at selected sites. Survivorship of embryos was higher at selected sites than at nonselected sites.
   Because of their small body size at sexual maturity, female striped mud turtles dig shallower nests than larger species of turtles and may need vegetative cover near the nest site to protect their embryos from thermal extremes. In these times of increased habitat destruction and alteration, it is important that we gain a more complete understanding of the quality of habitat needed for successful reproduction.

AB We manipulated air temperature in tussock tundra near Toolik Lake, Alaska, and determined the consequences for total plant biomass; aboveground net primary production (ANPP), ecosystem nitrogen (N) pools and N uptake, and ecosystem CO, flux. After 3.5 growing seasons, in situ plastic greenhouses that raised air temperature during the growing season had little effect on total biomass, N content, or growing-season N uptake of the major plant and soil pools. Similarly, vascular ANPP and net ecosystem CO, exchange did not change with warming, although net primary production of mosses decreased with warming. Such general lack of response supports the hypothesis that productivity in tundra is constrained by the indirect effects of cold temperatures (e.g., low nutrient availability or short growing-season length) rather than by cold growing-season temperatures per se.
   Despite no effect on net ecosystem CO, flux, air warming stimulated early-season gross photosynthesis (GP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) throughout the growing season. This increased carbon turnover was probably associated with species-level responses to increased air temperature. Warming increased the aboveground biomass of the overstory shrub, dwarf birch (Betula nana), and caused a significant net redistribution of N from the understory evergreen shrub, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, to B. nana, despite no effects on soil temperature, total plant N, or N availability. Thus, although air warming had no effect on total ecosystem N pools, it did mediate N distribution within the plant community. The early-season stimulation of GP is consistent with warming effects on leaf expansion of dominant shrubs (including B. nana) observed in other studies in tussock tundra. The stimulation of ER probably resulted from maintenance and growth respiration associated with higher aboveground B, nana biomass production and higher root N uptake and/or turnover in the greenhouses. The species responses to warming are consistent with changes in plant species assemblages associated with past warming and suggest that future warming may increase the abundance of B. nana in tussock tundra. We conclude that a 4 degrees C rise in air temperature alone will significantly stimulate carbon turnover in tundra but will have little effect on net carbon balance.

AB Catastrophic uprooting of forest canopy trees creates mounds, pits, and other microsites that provide opportunities for regeneration of particular species. We measured environmental factors on five types of microsites created by simulated blowdown of a mixed deciduous forest in central New England, United States. We then estimated spatial variation in resource levels and quantified congruence among different resources at each site. Effects of simulated blowdown on light levels and CO2 concentrations were more pronounced after three years than effects on nitrogen availability and other soil resources. Spatial heterogeneity in light levels and net nitrification rates was greater in the blowdown, but heterogeneities of soil organic matter concentration and net mineralization rates were greater in the undisturbed forest. Availability of nitrate, a limiting resource in most New England forests, was low on mounds and in pits, but high on the vertical portion of forest floor resulting from uprooting of canopy trees. At a spatial scale relevant to seedlings, resource congruence was greater in the undisturbed forest than in the experimental blowdown, primarily because of the effects of blowdown on light levels. Congruence in the blowdown increased with an increase in spatial scale, but congruence in the undisturbed forest was similar at both spatial scales. Seedling growth of two birch species was correlated with light levels and with congruence among soil resources. This study shows that immediate disturbance effects on microtopography and light levels determine recruitment patterns of colonizing species, with changes in soil resource levels influencing later community development. Furthermore, some species appear to respond to resource congruence, which may provide an additional dimension to the regeneration niche.

AB SADIE (Spatial Analysis by Distance Indices) is a new methodology to detect and measure the degree of nonrandomness in the two-dimensional spatial patterns of populations. It applies the same principles to data in the form of maps as to data in the form of counts at specified locations, but with different techniques. This paper considers data in the form of counts such as occur commonly in ecology. For such data the method has an advantage over traditional approaches that measure only statistical variance heterogeneity, because all the spatial information in the sample is used. Two indices and associated tests are reviewed, one based on the total distance of the sample from a completely regular arrangement, the other from a completely crowded arrangement. A new diagnostic plot is presented to aid interpretation. Results from some artificial data are studied to survey the properties of both indices for defined patterns of clustering. Indices based on the distance to regularity are powerful at detecting aggregation when several clusters are present; those based on the distance to crowding have the power to detect aggregation only when a single cluster is present. Methods are presented to estimate the typical cluster size and intercluster distance, suitable for data from sample units in the form of a contiguous grid. Examples are given for cyst-nematode field data and plant virus disease.

AB The soil properties most likely to influence species composition in lowland order of importance: P availability, Al toxicity, drainage, water-holding capacity, and availability of K, Ca, and Mg. A total of 18 studies were located in which species occurrence was studied in relation to such soil properties. Several of these report clear trends with soil physical properties, mainly drainage as affected by topographic position. Only three offer evidence for correlations with soil chemical properties. In all three, the study area spanned soils of very widely differing age and thus soil fertility. Failure to find correlations with chemical properties may be due to: lack of range in soil fertility across the sites studied. failure of soil test methods to measure availability of nutrients to plants, or temporal and spatial variability in soil properties.
   Existing soil classification systems do not provide enough information on any particular soil to help establish relations between its chemical properties and plant distribution. Nonetheless, soils at ecological study sites must be classified if their nature and properties are to be made clear to others working worldwide. Traditional, largely subjective, soil-mapping ;; techniques may reduce sampling needs by allowing stratification of soil and plant sampling by broad soil types. The mapping must be done, however, at a scale similar to the patchiness of the plant community (usually finer than 1:5000), something done in only 3 of the 18 studies located.
   Correlative studies; are ?only, the ;first step in understanding causal relations between soil properties and plant species distribution. Next, nutritional, drainage, and water requirements must be established for individual species. Then field experiments must be set up to establish cause and effect.

AB Few studies have evaluated the relative importance of multiple plant traits to herbivore diet choice, especially with an experimental approach. Moreover, although circumstantial evidence points to plant toughness and silica content as important determinents of diet choice, few studies have experimentally demonstrated that these factors actually deter feeding by herbivores. We examined feeding preferences of a generalist saltmarsh crab, Armases cinereum, for all the common angiosperms in its habitat. We took an experimental approach to evaluating the importance of toughness, secondary chemistry, silica, salt, and protein in determining feeding preferences.
   Consumption of plants by Armases in two experiments was correlated with decreasing toughness. Consumption was more equitable when plants were ground up and reconstituted in agar discs, with reduced differences in toughness. In four pairwise choice tests, Armases always preferred the softer plant of the pair, but in three of four cases exhibited no preference when the same plants were presented in reconstituted discs. Several plant extracts significantly stimulated or deterred feeding by Armases, but these effects were not consistent with and could not be used to predict overall preferences for fresh plants. Salt in artificial diets stimulated feeding by Armases. Silica had no effect on feeding in two experiments and stimulated feeding in a third. Armases was mildly stimulated to feed by high levels of protein in artificial diets, but these levels were above those found in plants, and the protein content of plants did not correlate with feeding preferences.
   Our results point towards plant toughness as most important in determining feeding choices of Armases. Since Armases is omnivorous, it may escape dietary constraints that affect feeding choices of pure herbivores. The dogma that silica defends plants against herbivory needs to be re-examined with additional experimental studies.

AB Fluctuating asymmetry (FA), or random non-directional deviations from perfect symmetry in bilaterally or radially symmetrical traits, has recently been proposed to be a useful indicator of genetic and environmental stress. However, the factors underlying fluctuating asymmetry, especially in plants, remain poorly understood. We sampled leaf fluctuating asymmetry among and within three species of even-aged birch (Betula pubescens, B. nana, and B. pendula) and their interspecific hybrids growing in common gardens of northern Finland to determine whether hybridization and environmental stress are associated with increased developmental instability. Our predictions were that: (1) interspecific hybrids among B. pubescens, B. nana, and B. pendula would have enhanced leaf FA compared to the parent groups because of a possible disruption of coadapted genomes; (2) intermediates between Betula pubescens sap. tortuosa and B. pubescens ssp. pubescens would have a slight decrease or no difference in leaf FA compared to the parent group; and (3) fluctuating asymmetry would increase between a low-elevation and a tree-line-elevation site, and this increase would be greater in B. pubescens, which forms the major subarctic community below the tree line, than in B. nana, which is common above the tree line.
   As predicted, leaf FA was higher in the tree-line common garden than in the lower elevation garden, but the amount of increase was not significantly different between B. pubescens and B. nana. Leaf asymmetry was also higher in hybrids than in parental taxa, and this response was fairly consistent among the three crosses. This suggests that interspecific hybridization resulted in higher developmental instability. Furthermore, in the intraspecific studies with B. pubescens, there was no relationship between tree height (an intraspecific hybrid index) and leaf asymmetry. Thus, these data support the ideas of Markow (1995) that the changes in asymmetry observed from hybridization will be a function of how closely related parental taxa are. Since leaf FA in Betula pubescens increased with elevation and hybridization, and both are important in tree-line dynamics, FA might be a useful indicator of stress and distributional limits in this and possibly other plant species.

AB Life history theory suggests that animals should balance their current investment in young against their chances to reproduce in the future. One fundamental prediction from the theory is that long-lived species should be restrictive in any increase of their current investment. It has been suggested that long-lived species, therefore, have evolved a fixed level of investment in young in order to maximize their own adult survival. However, recent experimental studies have shown that long-lived seabirds have a flexible reproductive performance and adjust their effort in raising young, both according to their own body condition and to the need of the chicks. In this study, we present a model of the optimal balance between reproductive effort and adult survival for long-lived birds breeding in a stochastic environment. During poor breeding conditions, maximum fitness is achieved either by not breeding at all, or by abandoning the brood. Beyond a certain threshold in breeding conditions, there is a steep increase in reproductive effort and an equally steep decrease in adult survival. The model is applied to two hypothetical long-lived seabirds differing in their potential fecundity. For the genotype with a potentially high fecundity, the model predicts a high threshold for breeding (i.e., breeding conditions need to be very good for the species to attempt breeding); above the threshold, the value of reproduction in terms of fitness is high. For the genotype with potentially low fecundity, the model predicts a low threshold for breeding, and the value of reproduction in terms of fitness is low. By increasing clutch size in the model, we examine the optimal response of the two genotypes to an experimental brood size manipulation. For both genotypes, the model predicts that the threshold for breeding is lower among controls than among enlarged broods, giving a range of possible outcomes of the experiment depending on breeding conditions. The few studies on brood enlargements in long-lived species carried out so far may support the predictions from the model.

AB Terrestrial carbon budgets and models of ecosystem carbon cycling rely on accurate field measurements of CO2 release from soils. Despite limitations of accuracy that require the use of a calibration curve, the soda-lime technique has distinct advantages that have resulted in its continued use for in situ measurements of soil respiration. In this note I report an error in the correction factor used to account for water formed during chemical adsorption of CO2 by soda lime. The appropriate correction factor (1.69 in place of 1.41) implies that all previously reported CO2 fluxes using the soda-lime method should by increased by 20%. Recent global estimates of soil CO2 release have relied largely on soda-lime data and will require reevaluation in the light of this correction.

We used multiple regression to identify key correlates of local native and introduced diversity for each regional scale. Both local (e.g., microhabitat diversity) and regional (e.g., species richness) factors were correlated with local diversity; regional diversity was the most consistent correlate. Plots of local vs, regional native diversity were asymptotic for the three largest regional definitions, thereby suggesting community saturation. However, analogous plots for introduced species were not asymptotic; local introduced diversity was a linear function of regional introduced diversity. Introduced populations were pervasive, but less abundant locally than native populations, thereby suggesting that native species are better adapted. Overall, stream fish communities in Virginia appeared to be neither completely saturated nor freely invadable.
   The ability of regression models and particular independent variables to account for variation in local diversity changed considerably with regional scale. Most regional correlates of local diversity were scale dependent. The concept of hierarchical environmental filters provides a useful framework for integrating the multiple scales over which ecological processes organize communities. Retrospective analyses of the impacts of introduced species on native communities provide some insight regarding community saturation, but conclusive evidence must await studies that couple comparative and experimental approaches. Clear interpretation of regional influences on local diversity will require careful definition of regions. Comparative analyses at multiple regional scales may be the most insightful approach to understanding the complete array of processes that organize communities.

AB Mechanisms by which an introduced container-dwelling mosquito, Aedes albopictus, may cause declines in a resident container-dwelling mosquito, Aedes aegypti, in South Florida were tested using a combination of field experiments and field observations. Field experiment 1 tested which species has a competitive advantage as larvae developing in water-filled tires. Densities and al availability of resources (leaf litter, which is a substrate for microorganisms fed upon by larvae) were manipulated in a factorial design. Contrary to previous laboratory experiments, A. albopictus was clearly the superior competitor in this tire environment, maintaining positive population growth at higher combined density and lower per capita resource availability than did A. aegypti. The primary determinant of success in this experiment was survivorship to adulthood, and A. aegypti only survived well in this environment when raised alone at low density, with high resource availability. Field experiment 2 tested whether this advantage for A. albopictus resulted from apparent competition mediated by shared protozoan parasites in the genus Ascogregarina. In field experiment 2, A. albopictus larvae had moderate to high levels of parasitism, but A. aegypti larvae were virtually free from Ascogregarina in all experimental tires, implying that Ascogregarina played little or no role in producing the advantage for A. albopictus in field experiment 1. Thus, apparent competition does not appear to be necessary to account for the replacement of A. aegypti by A. albopictus. As a first step toward understanding variation in the outcome of this invasion, numbers of Aedes immatures and masses of adults from field collected pupae (indicators of the intensity of competition) were compared for three sites with known histories of invasion by A. albopictus ana decline or A. aegypti. Differences among sites in both number of Aedes per container and masses of adults of both species were consistent with the hypothesis that intensity of competition varies among sites, and suggest that A. aegypti persists only at sites where interspecific competition is less intense. Resource competition among larvae appears to be sufficient to account for replacement of A. aegypti by A. albopictus in suburban and rural areas of South Florida, which may have been marginal habitats for A. aegypti.

AB The Luquillo Mountains of eastern Puerto Rico are used as a case study to evaluate possible single-or multiple-factor controls of productivity in montane forests. A review of published studies from the Luquillo Mountains revealed that canopy height, productivity, and species richness decline while stem density increases with elevation, as is typical of other montane forests. A mid-elevation floodplain palm stand with high levels of productivity provides a notable exception to this pattern. Previous basic and applied studies of productivity in the Luquillo Mountains have consistently considered the overall gradient in productivity to be important in understanding forest structure and function. Recent observational and experimental studies have determined that disturbance of all types is an important factor mediating productivity in both low-and high-elevation (cloud) forests, For example, low-elevation forest recovers more quickly :From hurricane disturbance and is more responsive to nutrient additions than is cloud forest. All of the factors proposed for limiting productivity are supported in one way or another by research in the Luquillo Mountains. What is critically lacking is both an appreciation for the way that these factors interact and experiments appropriate to evaluate multiple controls acting simultaneously.

AB Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) in the South Shetland Islands are recovering from 19th-century exploitation more slowly than the main population at South Georgia. To document demographic changes associated with the recovery in the South Shetlands, we monitored fur seal abundance and reproduction in the vicinity of Elephant Island during austral summers from 1986/1987 through 1994/1995. Total births, mean and variance of birth dates, and average daily mortality rates were estimated from daily live pup counts at North Cove (NC) and North Annex (NA) colonies on Seal Island. Sightings of leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) and incidents of leopard seal predation on fur seal pups were recorded opportunistically during daily fur seal research at both sites. High mortality of fur seal pups, attributed to predation by leopard seals frequently observed at NC, caused pup numbers to decline rapidly between January and March (i.e., prior to weaning) each year and probably caused a long-term decline in the size of that colony. The NA colony, where leopard seals were never observed, increased in size during the study. Pup mortality from causes other than leopard seal predation appeared to be similar at the two sites. The number of pups counted at four locations in the Elephant Island vicinity increased slowly, at an annual rate of 3.8%, compared to rates as high as 11% at other locations in the South Shetland Islands. Several lines of circumstantial evidence are consistent with the hypothesis that leopard seal predators limit the growth of the fur seal population in the Elephant Island area and perhaps in the broader population in the South Shetland Islands. The sustained growth of this fur seal population over many decades rules out certain predator-prey models, allowing inference about the interaction between leopard seals and fur seals even though it is less thoroughly studied than predator-prey systems of terrestrial vertebrates of the northern hemisphere. Top-down forces should be included in hypotheses for future research on the factors shaping the recovery of the fur seal population in the South Shetland Islands.

AB Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) affect plant distributions and mineral nitrogen availability when they forage by digging for the bulbs of glacier lilies (Erythronium grandiflorum) growing in subalpine meadows of Glacier National Park, Montana, United States. Our working hypothesis is that grizzly bears structure plant communities and influence nitrogen availability when they selectively dig for preferred plants. In this paper, we report on differences found in recently disturbed digs (<5 yr old) when compared to adjacent, undisturbed meadow.
   We used ion exchange resin bags to determine the availability of mineral nitrogen in grizzly bear digs compared to undisturbed meadow. Soil in digs contained significantly more ammonium-N and nitrate-N than adjacent, intact meadow. Glacier lily bulbs revegetating bear digs had higher tissue nitrogen and water-soluble carbohydrate concentrations than lilies in undisturbed meadow. Mature glacier lilies in digs produced twice as many seeds as did those in adjacent meadow. Glacier lily seedlings establish best on bare mineral soil, which in these meadows is found primarily in bear digs. Therefore, grizzly bear digging may benefit old, deeply seated plants that survive digging and reproduce. Digs overlapped spatially, meaning that grizzly bears were returning to dig in patches disturbed in previous years, perhaps in response to easier digging conditions and more nutritious glacier lily bulbs.
   To test the idea that the observed increase in mineral nitrogen was due to the physical disturbance of grizzly bear digging and not bear choice of sites already high in nitrogen or bear excretion, we created experimental digs. Ammonium-N and nitrate-N levels increased significantly following our digging treatment, just as we had observed in the natural bear digs. Although we do not know how a bear chooses an initial digging site, this disturbance has the potential for influencing long- and short-term plant community structure.

AB Induced chemical responses following herbivory are common in plants. Plant responses that change the level of physical or biotic defense are less well documented and poorly understood. Many Azteca spp. ants are obligate inhabitants of Cecropia spp. trees. In such ant-plant associations the ants are thought to be analogous to chemical defenses; previous experiments have demonstrated that ant occupation of C. obtusifolia reduced herbivory and plant competition and increased growth. Experiments, conducted over two years, on the dynamics of ant defense demonstrate that leaf damage caused a fivefold increase in the number of Azteca spp. ants on damaged leaves of C. obtusifolia compared to that on disturbed but undamaged control leaves. Ant activity peaked 8-12 min after damage, and differences between damaged and control leaves remained evident for 24 h. Such rapid induction of ant recruitment is likely to be particularly effective against unpredictable and mobile herbivores. The magnitude of the induced ant response to damage was strongly correlated with the number of ants patrolling the leaves before damage occurred. Ant responses to disturbance were not influenced by the presence of damage that had been applied 24 h previously. However, ant responses to subsequent damage, 24 h after initial damage, resulted in greater recruitment than to previously undamaged leaves.
   Ant recruitment to several other cues associated with herbivory was also tested. Presence of pyralid caterpillars that naturally feed on C. obtusifolia induced a low level of ant recruitment, and most larvae were removed from leaves by the ants within 10 min. Exposure to plant sap collected from damaged conspecifics and a commercially available green leaf volatile (hexanal) commonly released by plants after damage, both resulted in a doubling of ant numbers relative to controls. However, the levels of recruitment in response to these stimuli were insufficient to account for the high numbers of ants and persistence of recruitment observed on experimentally damaged leaves. Experimental wounding of leaves with minimal leaf tissue removal (using pin pricks) revealed that leaf wounds per se can only partially explain the induced ant recruitment following leaf damage. The type of herbivory and size of leaf wounds may be important cues for ant recruitment. Severed C. obtusifolia leaves that were freshly damaged failed to elicit an induced ant response when held adjacent to conspecific leaves with ants. However, induction of ant recruitment on damaged plants did significantly induce a low level of ant recruitment on neighboring conspecifics, providing evidence for interplant communication. Induced ant responses in the Cecropia-Azteca system are the result of multiple physical and chemical cues associated with herbivory. Ant responses to herbivory, although not previously studied in detail, are likely to be common among myrmecophytic plants and are likely to be an important component of antiherbivore defense in such systems.

AB The interplay of dispersal, disturbance, and local dynamics in spatial mosaics has profound effects on the stability and viability of populations. There are two main reasons to consider spatial models in population dynamics: (1) improved estimation of the parameters by utilizing spatial replications, and (2) ecologically realistic modeling. In this paper, we suggest models that are generalizations of the univariate population dynamics models (for example, Ricker or Gompertz) to space-time situations. We accommodate both spatially correlated environmental perturbations and dispersal. Moreover, we suggest computationally simple parameter estimation procedures based on estimating functions and provide an approach for obtaining approximate confidence intervals. The methodology is illustrated on the spatial time series of gypsy moths in the lower peninsula of Michigan.

AB Like plants, sessile invertebrates are often morphologically modified at high densities. At high densities acorn barnacles commonly form hummocks of tall, densely packed individuals. We examined hummock development and its consequences on filter feeding and growth in the northern acorn barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides.
   Hummocking occurs in response to high recruitment densities and growth rates, which intensify competition for primary substrate space. In the field, hummocks are more common at low than at high tidal heights, paralleling within-site variation in recruitment and growth rates. Hummocks also are most pronounced at high-flow sites with high barnacle recruitment and growth rates.
   In laboratory flume studies, particle capture rates were higher for individuals near the peak of hummocks than for solitary individuals, and were lower for individuals in the troughs between hummocks than for solitary individuals. Hummocked individuals are elevated above the surface and are thus likely exposed to higher particle fluxes than either individuals between hummocks or solitary individuals. These patterns in particle capture closely match patterns of barnacle shell growth in the field. The shells of hummocked individuals were larger than those of solitary individuals, which were larger than the shells of individuals in troughs between hummocks. The tissue growth of solitary individuals, however, is lower than that of crowded individuals, apparently since, without neighbors, solitary barnacles must allocate more resources to structural support than do crowded individuals. Thus, crowding may benefit individual barnacles by reducing their skeletal support costs.
   Most studies of crowding in sessile, space-limited invertebrates have focused on negative, competitive effects. Our results, along with previous work showing that crowding may benefit northern acorn barnacles by buffering them from heat and desiccation stress and increasing reproductive output, illustrate that crowding also can positively affect sessile organisms. We suggest that interactions among most sessile, space-limited invertebrates are best viewed as a balance between negative and positive effects.

AB Gypsy moth defoliation of oak trees has been shown to lead to increased tannin levels, which, in turn, lead to reduced gypsy moth growth and fecundity. In laboratory experiments, increased tannin levels can interfere with the transmission of a virus that is consumed by larvae on oak foliage, and high mortality rates of larvae in the field are sometimes associated with low levels of defoliation. These latter results have led to the suggestion that gypsy moth defoliation may cause reduced mortality attributable to the virus by elevating oak tannin levels. In a series of field experiments, we directly tested the hypothesis that gypsy moth defoliation of oaks leads to reduced virus transmission rates. In each of three study years, in oak forests with almost no naturally occurring gypsy moths or virus, we measured virus transmission rates in gypsy moths feeding on oaks, with and without experimental defoliation. By carefully synchronizing our experiments with the phenology of natural gypsy moth populations, we mimicked natural virus transmission processes during that part of the gypsy moth life cycle when virus transmission occurs. In our experiments, there was no effect of gypsy moth defoliation on tannin levels; consequently, virus transmission in both the held and the lab was unaffected by defoliation. Although we did observe increased tannin levels on more severely defoliated oak trees in one of two naturally defoliated oak stands late in the season, virus transmission had virtually ceased by that time. Our results suggest that gypsy moth defoliation does not affect tannin levels early enough in the larval season to have a measurable effect on the interaction between the gypsy moth and its nuclear polyhedrosis virus.

AB We evaluated the conditions under which patch size effects are important determinants of local population density for animals living in patchy landscapes. This information was used to predict when patch size effects will be expected to occur following habitat loss and fragmentation. Using meta-analysis, we quantitatively reviewed the results of 25 published studies that tested for a relationship between patch size and population density. Patch size effects were strong for edge and interior species (negative and positive patch size effects, respectively), but negligible for generalist species that use both edge and interior habitat. We found significant differences in mean patch size effects between migratory and residential species, between herbivores and carnivores, and among taxonomic groups. We found no evidence that patch size effects were related to landscape characteristics such as the proportion of landscape covered by habitat, median patch size, or the scale at which a study was conducted. However, species in the Western Hemisphere tended to have larger absolute effect sizes, and eastern species tended to be more variable in their response.
   For landscapes undergoing habitat loss and fragmentation, our results predict the following: (1) among generalist species that use both the edge and the interior of a habitat patch, the decline in population size associated with habitat destruction should be accounted for by pure habitat loss alone; (2) for interior species, the decline in population size associated with habitat fragmentation per se will be greater than that predicted from pure habitat loss alone; (3) for edge species, the decline in population size will be less than that predicted by pure habitat loss alone; (4) these relative effects will not be influenced by the extent of habitat loss, but they will be affected by the pattern of habitat when large or small patches are preferentially removed; and (5) as loss and fragmentation increase within a landscape, migratory species will generally suffer less of a decline in population size than resident species.

AB Plant communities of large portions of the southwestern United States have changed from grassland to desert shrubland. Previous studies have demonstrated that soil nutrient resources become spatially more heterogeneous and are redistributed into islands of fertility with the shift in vegetation. The research presented here addressed the question of whether soil resources become more temporally heterogeneous as well as more spatially heterogeneous when grassland undergoes desertification to form shrubland. Within adjacent grassland and creosotebush sites, soil profiles were described at three soil pits, and samples were collected for description of nutrient resources within the profile. Relative abundance of plant cover and bare soil was determined within each site using line transects. Surface samples (0-20 cm depth) of bare soil and soil beneath the canopies of grasses and creosotebush were collected 17 times during 1992-1994. Soil samples were analyzed for moisture, extractable ammonium and nitrate, nitrogen mineralization potential, microbial biomass carbon, total organic carbon, microbial respiration, dehydrogenase activity, the ratio of microbial C to total organic C (C-mic/C-org), and the ratio of microbial respiration to biomass carbon (metabolic quotient). The major differences in the structure of soils between sites were the apparent loss of 3-5 cm depth of sandy surface soil at the creosotebush site and an associated increase in calcium carbonate content at a more shallow depth. Soils under plants at both sites had greater total and available nutrient resources, with higher concentrations under creosotebush than under grasses. Greatest temporal variation in available soil resources was observed in soils under creosotebush. When expressed on the basis of area, available soil resources were higher in the grassland than in the creosotebush shrubland, primarily due to the difference in plant cover (45% in grassland, 8% in creosotebush shrubland).

AB Scatter diagrams have historically proved useful in the study of associative relationships in ecology. Several important ecological questions involve correlations between variables resulting in polygonal shapes, Two examples that have received considerable attention are patterns between prey size and predator size in animal populations and the relationship between animal abundance and body size. Each is typically illustrated using scatter diagrams with upper and lower boundaries of response variables often changing at different rates with changes in the independent variables, Despite recent statistical contributions that have stimulated an interest in characterizing the limits of a variable, a consensus on an appropriate methodology to quantify the boundaries of scatter diagrams has not yet been achieved, We tested regression techniques based on least squares and least absolute values models using several independent data sets on prey length and predator length for piscivorous fishes and compared estimated slopes for consistency, Our results indicated that least squares regression techniques were particularly sensitive to outlying y values and irregularities in the distribution of observations, and that they frequently produced inconsistent estimates of slope for upper and lower bounds. In contrast, quantile regression techniques based on least absolute values models appeared robust to outlying y values and sparseness within data sets, while providing consistent estimates of upper and lower bound slopes. Moreover, the use of quantile regression eliminated the need for an excess of arbitrary decision-making on the part of the investigator. We recommend quantile regression as an improvement to currently available techniques used to examine potential ecological relationships dependent upon quantitative information on the boundaries of polygonal relationships.

AB The decreased ability of northern red oak (Quercus rubra) to regenerate throughout its range in the eastern United States has important ecological and economic implications. We studied regeneration of northern red oak in oak and pine stands on moderately productive sites in northern Lower Michigan, Our objectives were (1) to investigate the hypothesis that regeneration of northern red oak is more successful in pine than in oak stands and (2) to test whether removal of potential overstory and understory competitors increases regeneration success on moderately productive sites.
   Northern red oak acorns and 2-yr-old nursery seedlings were planted in spring 1991 in three natural oak stands and three red pine (Pinus resinosa) plantations on comparable, moderately productive sites. Each stand contained four canopy cover treatments: clearcut, 25% cover (50% the first year), 75% cover, and uncut. Each canopy cover treatment contained four understory treatments: herb-layer removal, shrub-layer removal, litter removal, and control. Seedling survival, performance, and damage due to deer and late spring frosts were quantified along with vegetation characteristics, light, soil moisture, air temperature, soil temperature, and precipitation during the 1991 and 1992 growing seasons.
   Survival of seedlings was significantly lower in the pine than in the oak stands; the pine stands had a higher incidence of white-tailed deer browsing and lower levels of belowground resources than the oak stands. Canopy cover treatments produced a gradient from high stress (low light and soil moist-ire) and low disturbance (slight browsing and frost damage) in uncut plots to low stress (high light and soil moisture) and high disturbance (high browsing and frost damage) in clear-cut plots. Understory vegetation development and soil temperature were low in uncut plots, high in clear-cut plots, and intermediate in plots with partial overstory removal. Despite poor growth, the mortality of seedlings planted in uncut plots was low. In contrast, mortality was high and surviving seedlings exhibited good growth in clearcuts. Understory treatment effects were slight compared with overstory treatment effects. Results on our sites (1) do not support the hypothesis that regeneration success of northern red oak may be greater in pine than in oak stands and (2) indicate that the positive effects of removing potential competitors on seedling growth and physiological status may be compromised by simultaneous negative effects of browsing and frost damage.

AB Head webs in three lake basins were manipulated by altering fish communities to either reduce or increase the abundance of Daphnia. These basins were subsequently fertilized with nitrogen and phosphorus for two years. We tested three predictions about the response of heterotrophic flagellates, ciliates, and rotifers (collectively, microzooplankton) derived from prior studies. We: predicted that (I) microzooplankton would increase with lake fertilization, (2) lakes with abundant Daphnia would have lower increases in microzooplankton, and (3) both increases in resource availability and suppression by Daphnia would determine microzooplankton dynamics. Contrary to the first prediction, microzooplankton did not increase with fertilization relative to the reference lake, except in the low-Daphnia system, The second prediction was supported, as Daphnia prevented microzooplankton from increasing in the fertilized lakes with the strength of the Daphnia effect being greater than anticipated, Because of this strong effect, microzooplankton dynamics were: in all but one case most strongly related to suppression by Daphnia rather than to a combined effect of resources and suppression, The microzooplankton communities were differentially affected by the trophic cascade. Heterotrophic flagellates appeared to be limited by a variety of predators. Even in the low-Daphnia fertilized lake, mortality was apparently high, Ciliates and rotifers increased in the low-Daphnia fertilized lake and were strongly suppressed otherwise, These experiments indicate that small-scale, short-term experiments and larger-scale comparative analyses may be inadequate for assessing the strength of trophic interactions, The potential for community-level responses, not well assessed except at the ecosystem scale. may alternatively dampen or enhance the impacts of trophic cascades in food webs.

AB The ability of yellow pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus), deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), and other rodents to detect buried Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) and antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) seeds using olfaction was investigated during dry and moist conditions at the Whittell Forest and Wildlife Area in Little Valley, Washoe County, Nevada, USA. Removal of cached seeds was monitored on two Jeffrey pine foraging grids (each with 100 caches of five seeds buried 5 mm deep) and on two bitterbrush foraging grids (each with 100 caches of 15 seeds buried at the same depth). Under dry conditions, soil typically contained <0.5% water, whereas Jeffrey pine and bitterbrush seeds contained 4.37 +/- 1.46% water (mean +/- 1 SD) and 7.45 +/- 1.83% water, respectively. Under these conditions, rodents found a mean of 0.33% of available Jeffrey pine seed caches each day and 0.14% of available bitterbrush seed caches each day. After rains, soil moisture increased to as much as 8.5%, and Jeffrey pine and bitterbrush seeds contained 17.50 +/- 12.04% water and 28.04 +/- 16.35% water, respectively. When seeds and soil were moistened, the rate at which rodents removed caches increased dramatically; 8.8% of available Jeffrey pine seed caches and 2.1% of available bitterbrush seed caches were removed each day. Similar results were obtained when other foraging grids were artificially watered during a summer drought.
   Seeds are very hygroscopic, rapidly absorbing water whenever the environment around them becomes moistened. This moisture appears to trigger the release of odorant molecules from the seeds, which rodents can readily detect. Under dry conditions, release of odorant molecules is apparently reduced to the point that some rodents have difficulty detecting buried seeds. These results may have important implications for rodent-seed interactions, but more generally, they suggest that, for terrestrial animals inhabiting arid environments, variation in environmental water level may modulate olfactory sensitivity in many other contexts where olfaction is important, such as assessing food patch quality, social behavior, predator-prey relations, and interspecific competition.

AB The primary aim of the work reported in this paper is to elucidate the relationship between discrete and continuous deterministic representations of spatial population processes. Our experimental vehicle is a spatially explicit version of the Rosenzweig-McArthur model with immobile prey and a diffusively dispersing predator. We find that careful formulation of the discrete representation leads to essentially complete behavioral concordance between the two representations. We examine the invasions that follow localized introduction of predators into such a system and show that the biological realism of the model predictions can be greatly enhanced by preventing in situ regrowth of predator populations from densities that should be interpreted as representing local extinction. We exploit the close concordance of behavior between continuous and discrete representations by using the discrete version to perform a wide range of numerical experiments on one-dimensional and two-dimensional systems, while turning to the continous version to provide approximate analytic results for the natural time and space scales of the predicted population patterns. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for the experimental and theoretical study of spatial population dynamics.

AB Interstitial water, faunal samples, and hydrogeological data were collected beneath a riffle on the Speed River, southern Ontario, Canada. The purpose was to identify the location and seasonal fluctuation of the hyporheic/groundwater interface and to examine several aspects of water mass chemical signatures and the dynamics of the interstitial fauna. Concentration discontinuities in several water chemistry parameters delineated the chemical boundary between the true groundwater and hyporheic habitats. The groundwater mass was characterized as having higher levels of ammonium, alkalinity, and conductivity, and lower nitrate levels. Differences in water chemistry between the hyporheic and groundwater zones persisted throughout the year, though no single variable differed quantitatively between these two zones on all occasions. The location of the chemical discontinuity varied seasonally. Whereas hyporheic and groundwater faunal subunits of the interstitial community were identified and the location of the subunits coincided with the chemical breaklines, response to shifts in the position of the hyporheic/groundwater interface was taxon rather than subunit based. Fauna therefore provided poor spatial resolution in terms of pinpointing the location of the interface. Boundary fluctuation coincided with extremes in seasonal discharge patterns and was regulated by the relative strength of the upward force of baseflow and the downward force of advecting surface water. Identifying patterns of fluctuation of the hyporheic/groundwater interface, and consequently hyporheic habitat volume, may have important consequences for the storage, retention, and cycling of nutrients in lotic ecosystems.

AB We estimated natal and breeding philopatry and dispersal probabilities for a metapopulation of Black Brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) based on observations of marked birds at six breeding colonies in Alaska, 1986-1994. Both adult females and males exhibited high (>0.90) probability of philopatry to breeding colonies. Probability of natal philopatry was significantly higher for females than males. Natal dispersal of males was recorded between every pair of colonies, whereas natal dispersal of females was observed between only half of the colony pairs. We suggest that female-biased philopatry was the result of timing of pair formation and characteristics of the mating system of brant, rather than factors related to inbreeding avoidance or optimal discrepancy. Probability of natal philopatry of females increased with age but declined with year of banding. Age-related increase in natal philopatry was positively related to higher breeding probability of older females. Declines in natal philopatry with year of banding corresponded negatively to a period of increasing population density; therefore, local population density may influence the probability of nonbreeding and gene flow among colonies.

AB Estimating species richness (i.e., the actual number of species present in a given area) is a basic objective of many field studies carried out in community ecology and is also of crucial concern when dealing with the conservation and management of biodiversity. In most studies, the total number of species recorded in an area at a given time is taken as a measure of species richness. Here we use a capture-recapture approach to species richness estimation with North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data in order to estimate species detectability and thus gain insight about its importance. In particular competing models making different assumptions about species detectability are available. We carried out analyses on all survey routes of four states, Arizona, Maryland, North Dakota, and Wisconsin, in two years, 1970 and 1990. These states were chosen to provide contrasting habitats, bird species composition, and survey quality. We investigated the effect of state, year, and observer ability on the proportions of different models selected, and on estimates of detectability and species richness. Our results indicate that model M-h, which assumes heterogeneous detection probability among species, is frequently appropriate for estimating species richness from BBS data. Species detectability varied among states and was higher for the more skilled observers. These results emphasize the need to take into account potential heterogeneities in detectability among species in studies of factors affecting species richness.

AB Recruitment in plants is the result of several processes operating from the time the seeds are mature and ready to be released from the parent plant to the time the seedlings emerge and become photosynthetically self-sufficient. In most species of strongly seasonal climates (e.g., trees of the cold temperate forests of North America and Japan), seed dispersal and seedling establishment are processes separated in time by at least a few weeks and more typically by a few months. This leaves ample opportunity for various factors to affect the spatial patterns of seed dispersal, survival and germination, and seedling emergence. Spatial uncoupling between these sequential processes leads to spatial independence (i.e., absence of a relationship) in the abundance patterns of life stages. Along a topographical gradient in an old-growth cold temperate forest of northeastern North America, I analyzed the spatial patterns of seed rain, seed bank, and seedling emergence of a major tree component, Betula alleghaniensis, over a 4-yr period. I examined the degree of consistency through time of the spatial patterns of each life stage and of their relationships with one another. Seed rain and seedling spatial patterns were quite variable through time, but that of the seed bank was relatively consistent despite large interyear fluctuations in abundance. Overall, two major spatial patterns emerged along the topographical gradient: one that emphasized the three peaks of density of mature Betula trees, and one with a single peak in the middle section of the gradient, where Betula tree density was higher. Correlations between the spatial patterns of seed and seedling abundance were significant in some years, but not in others. Seed survival was practically constant in space in one year, but quite variable in another; yet, it was consistently density independent. Spatial uncoupling was important between processes as reflected by the spatial independence between life-stage abundance patterns. This uncoupling significantly contributes to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the system and complicates fine-scale modeling of population and community dynamics.

AB To assess the impact of lizards on species richness and properties of individual species of web spiders, we conducted a 4.5-yr field experiment on Staniel Cay, Exumas, Bahamas. Spider populations were censused at similar to 2-mo intervals in lizard-removal enclosures and in control enclosures with lizards present at natural densities. Lizards reduced total number of individuals, species richness (number of species), and composite diversity of web spiders. The differential absence of rare species was primarily responsible for the lower species richness in controls than in lizard-removal enclosures. The impact of lizards on the abundance of Metepeira datona, the numerically dominant spider species, was weaker than the impact on the abundance of all rarer species combined. Mean body lengths of Argiope argentata, a large, rare spider, were larger in removals than in controls, whereas mean body lengths of M. datona, a small, common spider, did not differ significantly in removals and controls. A. argentata were closer to the ground than two commoner species and thereby were potentially more vulnerable to lizard predation.
   The present mainland-enclosure experiment and an island-introduction experiment both demonstrated the same general pattern of lizard predation: exclusion of rare spider species. However, the impact of lizards on spiders was more devastating in the island experiment.
   Other experimental field studies that had terrestrial animals as subjects and that separately analyzed at least all common species in a prey assemblage demonstrated that predators reduced or had no effect upon prey species diversity. Each study in which predators reduced diversity indicated that local extinction of rare species in experimental areas with predators was common.

AB Spatial and temporal variability in soil biotic populations reflect heterogeneity in soil resources, affect patterns of soil process rates, and facilitate coexistence of diverse biota. We investigated these relationships in a 0.7-ha restored riparian wetland in the Coastal Plain of Georgia, USA, for an abundant and diverse group of soil fauna, the bacterivorous nematodes. We quantified spatial distributions in four different seasons for the eight most dominant bacterivorous taxa in the wetland and related their individual distributions to patterns of microbial respiration, inorganic nitrogen, moisture, and soil organic matter. We used geostatistics to quantify spatial aggregation and draw isopleths.
   For all variates except two nematode taxa, 36-99% of sample population variance was spatially dependent, over ranges of 11-84 m. Isopleths and spatial trend analysis showed that individual bacterivorous taxa exhibited divergent spatial distributions, with populations aggregating into different hotspots in the wetland. Although these large-scale trends persisted at all sampling dates, small-scale patterning showed significant temporal variation due to rise and fall of local populations. Individual nematode distributions did not correspond well to the (temporally more static) soil resource patterns, except occasionally to soil moisture and nitrate content. We attribute the general lack of correlation between nematode and soil resource patterns in part to the young age (2.5-3.5 yr) of the investigated wetland site. Although nematode patterns remain inadequately explained, we suggest that the observed spatiotemporal divergence among populations of bacterivorous taxa has important implications for our understanding of soil ecosystem and community processes, notably the spatiotemporal distribution of nematode-influenced nitrogen cycling rates and the maintenance of field-scale nematode diversity.

AB We tested whether standing autotrophic (unicellular algal) biomass is sensitive to variation in initial consumer (nondecomposer, heterotrophic protistan) diversity in experimental microbial microcosms. Our results showed a strong, negative relationship between autotrophic biomass and consumer species richness. Additional microcosm experiments showed that this relationship was due largely to the direct and indirect trophic effects of consumers on autotrophs and decomposers. Collectively, these experiments suggest that standing autotrophic biomass is a function of community composition, trophic structure, and consumer diversity, the determining factors being the number of trophic levels, the discreteness of trophic levels, and the ecological equivalency of species within trophic levels. Our results suggest that ecosystem response to variation in consumer diversity can range from abrupt changes between "green" (high autotrophic biomass) and "barren" (low autotrophic biomass) states to relatively smooth transitions between these states.

AB Clonal plant foraging has been examined primarily on individual clones exposed to resource-poor and resource-rich environments. We designed an experiment to examine the clonal foraging behavior of the rhizomatous grass Elymus lanceolatus ssp. lanceolatus under the influence of neighboring plant root systems in a heterogeneous nutrient environment. Individual Elymus clones were planted in large bins together with one of three neighboring grass species, Agropyron desertorum, Pseudoroegneria spicata, or Bromus tectorum, which differ in rooting density and growth activity. The position of Elymus clones was manipulated so rhizomes encountered a short-duration nutrient patch and subsequently root systems of the neighboring plants. Unexpectedly, the morphological plasticity of the perennial grass Elymus lanceolatus ssp. lanceolatus was influenced by the presence of the neighboring species much more than by the local nutrient enrichments, although nutrient patches did amplify some of the foraging responses. Elymus rhizomes branched readily and initiated large daughter plants as they encountered the low-density root systems of Pseudoroegneria. When Elymus encountered the fine, dense root systems of the annual Bromus, clonal expansion was initially reduced. Yet, after the short growing season of Bromus, Elymus resumed clonal expansion and produced several daughter plants. Elymus clones were most constrained by the fine, dense root systems of Agropyron desertorum. In this case, a few, long rhizomes avoided the densely rooted soil environment by growing aboveground as stolons crossing over the Agropyron tussocks. Elymus clonal biomass was largest in neighborhoods of Pseudoroegneria, intermediate in neighborhoods with Bromus, and smallest in neighborhoods with Agropyron. The latter were approximately half the size of those in the Pseudoroegneria environments. Elymus growth could not be explained by simple resource competition alone; other mechanisms must have been involved in the apparent differences in interference patterns of neighboring plants with Elymus.

AB The study of phenotypic plasticity, one of the most important mechanisms of phenotypic adaptation, is by tradition focused on differences in ontogenetically static phenotypic expression in different environments. Ontogenetic reaction norms, in contrast, describe how phenotypes unfold during growth in different environments. We studied the ontogenetic reaction norms of the morphological shape of a series of defensive abdominal spines in dragonfly larvae, both in the laboratory and in a number of natural populations. In a laboratory rearing experiment, we demonstrated that these spines grew more solid and elongated when waterborne environmental cues of fish predators were present: this is evidence of phenotypic plasticity in defensive spine morphology. The ontogenetic reaction norms of defensive spines were also found to differ in natural populations with and without fish. A detailed analysis of the growth trajectories showed that this differentiation was primarily due to ontogenetic acceleration in environments with fish, leading to relatively exaggerated spine shape in these environments. However, while the ontogenetic trajectories of shape in some spines diverged at the onset of ontogeny in the two environments, those of others remained parallel until a given phase of ontogeny. Hence, the timing of the developmental divergence of these phenotypically integrated traits differed, suggesting differences in the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Our results illustrate that a conceptual integration of environmental and ontogenetic approaches to the study of phenotypic differentiation can significantly promote our understanding of the ecology and evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity.

AB Food quality often has profound effects on life history traits and individual fitness, altering rates of growth and development, changing the timing of reproduction, and shifting the trade-off between egg size and egg number. Few data are available on the effects of food quality on copepod life history traits. We measured several life history traits on a large number of individuals to document the effects of food quality on individual traits, on life history correlates, and on a composite measure of individual fitness in the freshwater copepod Boeckella triarticulata Thomson. Nauplii were raised individually on two diets: one consisted of the high quality alga Cryptomonas sp. (abbreviated as CR), and the second diet consisted of a combination of Cryptomonas sp. and the low quality cyanobacterium Anabaena flos-aquae (CA). The mixed CA diet slowed growth and development so that individuals raised on this diet were older and smaller at metamorphosis and maturity. Despite these effects, there were no differences between diets in survival to maturity, and male copepods raised on the mixed diet lived significantly longer than females or than either sex raised on Cryptomonas alone. Females raised on the mixed diet produced more and larger clutches than those raised on CR, so that total egg production increased on this diet, although large intradiet variation obscured statistical differences between diets in these parameters. Intradiet variation was due to a large range in the number of clutches produced by individual females: some individuals produced 10-15 clutches, contradicting previous descriptions of this species as semelparous. Although diet affected age at first reproduction, it had no significant effect on individual fitness, estimated as lambda. Boeckella triarticulata achieved high fitness either by minimizing age at first reproduction (CR diet) or by increasing reproductive output (CA diet). Data collected from cast-off exuviae allow nondestructive measures of individual life history traits along with a composite measure of individual fitness. Combining these two analyses is an important step in unraveling life history correlates and in identifying the selective forces driving life history evolution in these crustaceans.

AB Impacts of climate change were simulated over five summer seasons in a high arctic polar semi-desert at Ny Alesund, Svalbard, by using polythene tents to increase temperature, and by increasing precipitation and soil nutrient (NPK) availability. The effects of these treatments on vegetation cover were assessed at the start of the 1991, 1993, and 1995 field seasons, and at peak biomass in the same years. Over the first season of the experiment (1991), changes in percentage total living vegetation cover were significantly greater, and changes in dead vegetation cover significantly lower, in the tented treatments. In subsequent seasons, changes in total living cover were also greater under treatments simulating climate change, although the significant factors and interactions were year-specific. Between years, at both the early and mid-season sampling periods, the fertilizer application had the strongest effect on changes in plant cover, significantly decreasing cover of living Dryas octopetala, Saxifraga oppositifolia, and bare ground between 1991 and 1995, while increasing cover of bryophytes, Salix polaris, Polygonum viviparum, and total dead vegetation. Although cover of D. octopetala was greater during the first three years of fertilizer addition, marked winter injury occurred in this species on fertilized plots during winter 1993-1994. This resulted in reductions in total live cover and D. octopetala cover and an increase in total dead cover (by up to 22%) in watered and fertilized plots between 1991 and 1995. Seedlings of nitrophilous "immigrant" species were established naturally on bare ground in fertilized plots in the third year of the study and subsequently increased in number, so that after five seasons the community tended more toward bird-cliff vegetation rather than polar semi-desert vegetation. The tent treatment and the simulated increase in summer precipitation had little effect between seasons on the plant community, in comparison with the fertilizer treatment.

   CONSEQUENCES
AB Over a 9-yr period, we studied dispersal of young banded Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) from their natal nest to the site where they first bred 1 yr later in a population on an isolated archipelago in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. On a broad geographic scale, young birds were highly philopatric, returning from wintering grounds several thousand kilometers away to nest on the same island and often in the same field where they had hatched the year before. In some cases, birds chose nest sites within a few meters of their natal nest. The median dispersal distance between a bird's natal nest and its first nest as an adult was 228 m, a distance equivalent to about six times the diameter of an average territory. Nearly three-quarters of the breeding birds in the study population had been banded as nestlings or fledglings within a 10-ha area on one island, which suggests that most birds in the population originated within the 127-ha archipelago.
   Within the archipelago, males and females dispersed similar distances from their natal site. There was no correlation between natal dispersal distances of parents and their offspring, nor was there a correlation between natal dispersal distances of siblings, which indicated that natal dispersal has low heritability. Sex, hatching date, fledging mass, and population densities during the previous and current years were all poor predictors of natal dispersal distance. Males that were strongly philopatric recruited significantly more offspring during their lifetime than males raised outside the study area, although there were no differences between philopatric and dispersing females.
   Birds tended to shift to distinct parts of the island to breed if their parents of the opposite sex still occupied the territory where they had hatched. Dispersal was not affected by return of same-sex parents. Distances between nests of siblings raised the same year were farther apart than expected by chance, based on Monte Carlo simulations. Although many birds in the population had the opportunity to pair with kin, some mechanism, yet to be determined, enabled birds to avoid inbreeding: in 1073 nesting attempts involving birds of known parentage, no individuals were known to have paired with close relatives (coefficient of kinship >0.125). Because complete inbreeding avoidance occurred in <1% of Monte Carlo simulations, the absence of inbreeding among Kent Island Savannah Sparrows is unlikely to be due to chance.
   Understanding natal dispersal in birds requires a combination of models: ecogenetic models at broad geographic scales (e.g., adaptation to local environments), ecological constraints and neutral models at smaller spatial scales (e.g., unavailability of territories within particular habitats), and genetic models (e.g., inbreeding avoidance).

AB Although previous studies hint at the occurrence of substantial spatial variation in the accumulation rates of C and N in bogs, the extent to which rates may vary on high-resolution spatial and temporal scales is not known. A main reason for the lack of knowledge is that it is problematic to determine the precise age of peat at a given depth. We determined rates of carbon and nitrogen accumulation in the uppermost decimeters of a bog ecosystem using the pine method, which enables accurate dating of surface pear layers. We combined accumulation data with numerical and geostatistical analyses of the recent vegetation to establish the relationship between bog vegetation and rate of peat accumulation. Use of a laser technique for spatial positioning of 151 age-determined peat cores within a 20 x 20 m plot made it possible for us to give the first fine-scaled account of spatial and temporal variation in rates of mass, carbon, and nitrogen accumulation during the last century.
   Rates of C and N accumulation were highly variable at all spatial scales studied. For example, after similar to 125 yr of peat growth, C and N accumulation varied by factors of five and four, respectively, from 25 to 125 g/dm(2) for C, and from 0.7 to 2.6 g/dm(2) for N. It takes similar to 40 yr of peat accumulation before significant amounts of C are lost through decay. Hummocks built up by Sphagnum fuscum and S. rebellum were able to maintain average rates of C accumulation that exceed 2 g.dm(-2).yr(-1) during 50 yr of growth. We argue that data on spatial variation in rates of C accumulation are necessary to understand the role of boreal peatlands in the greenhouse effect and global climate.

AB In the context of potential-global warming, it is critical that ecologists bridge the typically local spatial scale of ecology to the regional scale of climatology by linking ecosystem responses to variations in the large-scale synoptic controls of regional climates. In northern Patagonia, Argentina, we related regional-scale tree mortality events over the past similar to 100 years to annual and decadal-scale climatic variations associated with changes in the major synoptic climatic controls of the southeastern Pacific region, including the El Ni (n) over tilde o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In nine stands of Austrocedrus chilensis, a xeric conifer, we used dendrochronological techniques to date the outermost tree ring on dead-standing and fallen trees to estimate the dates of tree death for 336 trees. To evaluate climatic conditions during periods of high tree mortality, we used regional records of precipitation and temperature from six climate stations and also used a regional set of 24 tree ring chronologies from Austrocedrus.
   Good preservation of the resinous wood of Austrocedrus allowed relatively precise dating of tree deaths over the past similar to 90 years. Episodes of massive tree mortality coincide with exceptionally dry springs and summers during the 1910s, 1942-1943, and the; 1950s. Although there is a general regional synchroneity of tree death associated with drought, intra-regional variations in the intensity of droughts, as interpolated and mapped from the regional network of tree ring chronologies, are also reflected by north-to-south variations in tree mortality patterns.
   Periods of drought and associated tree mortality during the 20th century in northern Patagonia are strongly associated with above average sea level atmospheric pressure off the coast of Chile at the same latitudes. Temperature and precipitation in northern Patagonia are highly influenced by the intensity and latitudinal position of the southeastern Pacific anticyclone, which, in turn, are greatly affected by ENSO. Tree mortality in northern Patagonia appears to be intensified by extreme events of the Southern Oscillation and is more strongly coincident with El Ni (n) over tilde o events along the coast of northern Peru. These results, in combination with previously established climatic influences on fire occurrence and tree seedling establishment, strongly link stand-level and regional-scale forest dynamic processes in northern Patagonia with variations in large-scale atmospheric conditions.

AB We assessed the effect that varying patterns of biomass allocation had on growth of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) growing in the desert climate of the Great Basin and the montane climate of the eastern Sierra Nevada. Prior work established that desert trees have lower leaf:sapwood area ratios than montane trees (0.104 and 0.201 m(2)/ cm(2), respectively) and proportionally greater stem respiration. Sapwood:leaf mass ratios are also greater and increase more as a function stem diameter in desert than in montane trees. We hypothesized that this increased allocation of carbon to stem sapwood and stem respiration in large trees could decrease growth rates in the desert compared to the montane environment, in addition to any growth reduction imposed by drought on physiology and growth processes. Trees of all diameters (dbh) in the desert environment had lower relative growth rates (RGRs) than montane trees (e.g., for a 30 cm dbh tree, RGR = 0.012 vs. 0.021 kg.kg(-1).yr(-1), respectively). However, growth rates of desert and montane trees declined similarly with increasing dbh and did not reflect diverging sapwood : leaf mass ratios.
   Alternatively, we hypothesized that desert trees may increase rates of photosynthetic carbon accumulation (per unit leaf area) with diameter, thereby compensating for increased sapwood respiration. Leaf nitrogen (N) concentration and stable-carbon isotope composition (delta(13)C) were measured to examine size-dependent and seasonally integrated photosynthetic capacity within desert and montane environments. Nitrogen concentration was correlated with photosynthetic capacity. Leaf nitrogen (N) concentration and delta(13)C values were greater in the desert (e.g., in 1-yr-old needles, desert = 1.11% and -22.96 parts per thousand; montane = 0.94% and -24.20 parts per thousand) and differed between desert and montane trees as a function of dbh, In desert trees, leaf nitrogen concentration in 1-yr-old through 5-yr-old needles increased with dbh, and carbon isotope composition in l-yr-old needles increased with dbh, suggesting increased photosynthetic capacity and photosynthetic rates with increasing tree size. Needle nitrogen concentration and delta(13)C values decreased or remained constant with dbh in montane trees. Desert trees had greater light extinction coefficients and retained fewer needle cohorts. Our results suggest that increased allocation to heterotrophic stem tissue at the expense of photosynthetic tissue does not always incur a reduction in tree growth as predicted by current models of forest productivity.

AB We examined the demographic responses of Fagus grandifolia to Hurricane Kate (1985) in an old-growth Southern mixed-hardwood forest in northern Florida. ?Matrix population models were used to contrast pre-and post-hurricane population trends (1978-1992) with predictions of four hypotheses of the persistence of this shade-tolerant species in hurricane-frequented forests (resistance, recovery, release, and complementation). Although growth and mortality schedules changed as a result of the hurricane, the asymptotic population growth rate did not: change significantly and did not depart significantly from lambda = 1 (stability) in either the pre-or the posthurricane periods. Long-term trends simulated for varying hurricane frequencies also projected stability in population size. These results supported the resistance hypothesis. Elasticity analysis showed that, while recruitment had a minor influence, survival of medium-sized trees was the most critical character influencing population growth, Similar patterns of life history sensitivity are common among other toes, suggesting that traits related to survival of large understory individuals would; often he under high selection pressure. Among these traits, those associated with hurricane resistance could also be advantageous in forests subjected to light to moderate disturbance. Thus, resistance to canopy disruption could have remained linked to shade tolerance during expansions and contractions of the distribution of F. grandifolia.

AB Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) differ from lowland moist forests in structure (low stature, small and tough leaves, low diversity) and functioning (low productivity, low nutrient-cycling rates). To explain these differences, a variety of hypotheses have been proposed, most of which are related directly or indirectly to climate, but none of these provides a satisfactory explanation for all typical TMCF traits. The single climatic factor shared by all TMCF, the frequent occurrence of low cloud, has multiple effects, but not all are well understood, In this paper we describe and analyze the climatic and soil-moisture conditions prevailing in TMCF as reported in the literature. TMCF evapotranspiration is limited by both climatic conditions and canopy conductance. TMCF productivity is low, but our understanding of these forest's carbon balance is incomplete. Leaf photosynthetic capacity is not particularly low, but canopy photosynthesis probably is, due to persistent cloudiness (low radiation) and a low leaf-area index (LAI). We suggest that the low LAI of TMCF is controlled by light climate and by leaf structure and longevity. TMCF productivity is probably further limited by a substantial investment of carbon in the growth and functioning of a relatively large root system, which is itself a consequence of unfavorable soil conditions.

AB In Fennoscandian boreal forests, in which productivity in general is N limited, there are regular, topographically related variations in forest productivity and plant community composition. Regional surveys have demonstrated strong correlations among soil pH, N content, and base saturation on the one hand and plant productivity and community composition on the other, but the nature of these relationships is poorly understood. We studied in detail the variation in and controls of soil acidity, availability of N and P and changes in community composition and plant nutrition along a short (only 90 m long) but extreme forest productivity gradient in northern Sweden, which ranged from a groundwater recharge area with low productivity to a very productive discharge area.
   The pH in the soil solution of the mor layer ranged from 3.5 in the recharge area to 6.4 in the discharge area, and it was strongly correlated with the base saturation of the exchange complex. Neither the acid strength of organic matter, the ionic strength of the soil solution, nor the quantity of acids could explain more than a minor part of this variation in pH. There were strong correlations between total N in the mor layer and soil solution pH (r = 0.97) and base saturation cf the exchange complex (r = 0.88). At the poor end of the transect the concentration of inorganic N was very low in the mor, and plants with either ectomycorrhizae (ECM) or ericoid mycorrhizae (EM) dominated. With increasing pH, there was an increase in NH(4), concentrations, while plants that potentially have arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) became prominent along with ECM and EM species. In the discharge area, which comprised only the last 10 m of the transect, NO(3), dominated over NH(4), in the soil solution, the soil had a high capacity for net nitrification, and the vegetation was totally dominated by potentially AM or nonmycorrhizal herbs, some of which had high foliar nitrate reductase activity. Foliar and root N concentrations increased steeply towards the discharge area, but foliar P/N ratios declined below critical levels at the end of the transect. Root (32)P uptake bioassays also indicated a P deficiency in the discharge area, where the soil total P content was high, while the concentration of PO(4), in the soil solution was very low. The high capacity of the mor in the discharge area to adsorb PO(4),, due to the presence of organically complexed, Fe and Fe-oxihydroxides, may explain the low PO(4) concentrations.
   Our data indicate that the underlying factors influencing both productivity and community composition are pH and supply of base cations. Fundamental differences in exchange characteristics of soil and soil water underlie other related nutrient supply features, in particular the amount and availability of N. Our study of a single short topographic transect supported a previous suggestion based on a regional survey in Norway that variability in soil pH and the supply of base cations affects plant productivity and community composition via effects on N supply. Our data also encompass the interrelations between soil pH, soil N turnover, and the mycorrhizal type of dominant plant species, which, according to Read (1991), occur along long latitudinal or altitudinal climatic gradients. Through millennia discharge areas like the one observed by us have probably provided a relatively stable environment for plants demanding high soil pH and N supply, at the same time as surrounding recharge areas have been acidified naturally through podzolization.

AB Seed dispersion patterns are largely determined by the maternal plant. Characters of the progeny, such as dispersal, that are determined by the maternal parent and that vary with the maternal environment are said to exhibit maternal environmental effects. Because dispersal is maternally determined, the response to selection on dispersal depends on the correlations between generations for maternal traits that influence dispersal. These correlations depend on the direction and degree to which the maternal plant responds to its environment. Although it is widely appreciated that seed dispersal is maternally determined, the evolution of dispersal has not yet been addressed within the context of maternal character evolution. In this study, I identify maternal traits that influence seed dispersion patterns and characterize their variation as a function of maternal environmental conditions in order to determine whether maternal environmental effects on dispersal are possible and to predict the direction of correlations between generations for these traits. The traits included morphological traits of the fruits and architectural traits of the maternal plant. Laboratory and field studies were combined to investigate dispersal of Cakile edentula var. lacustris, an annual beach plant with heteromorphic fruit segments. Fruit traits influenced dispersal under laboratory conditions and in the field. Taller, more sparsely branched plants with a greater percentage of fruits on their primary stem had impeded dispersal, and plants with more fruit segments had denser seed shadows. Path analysis revealed that the total effect of a trait on dispersal often differed from its direct effect because of intercorrelations among variables. Environmental factors influenced dispersal directly, but they also strongly influenced the expression of plant traits. By considering both the effects of plant traits on dispersal and the influence of environmental variables, such as density, on the expression of these plant traits, this study predicts positive phenotypic correlations between maternal and progeny generations for some traits and negative correlations for others. The extent to which each maternal trait influences dispersal, the extent to which it varies with the environment, and the extent to which the environment varies as a function of dispersal will all influence phenotypic correlations between maternal parent and offspring. Consequently, these factors are expected to influence the response of dispersal to selection.

AB Trees and shrubs establishing in grasslands frequently occur in clumps associated with increased soil moisture and N availability. We tested whether the presence of conspecifics or enhanced soil resources increased the growth and survivorship of a shrub (Symphoricarpos occidentalis) and a tree (Picea glauca) in the presence of the perennial grass (Bromus inermis). Rhizomes of Symphoricarpos and seedlings of Picea were transplanted into plots either singly or with four conspecific neighbors, and with grass neighbors present or removed. Half the plots received additional water, N, and shade to simulate a forest environment. Roots and shoots of transplants were harvested after two growing seasons. Soil moisture and available N were lowest at high transplant density, and highest in the simulated-forest environment and in treatments where grass was removed. Transplant survivorship was generally enhanced in plots where grasses were removed and in the simulated-forest environment. Picea survivorship was reduced by grasses in plots without resource manipulations but was unaffected by grasses in the simulated-Forest environment, suggesting that the simulated-forest environment enhanced the ability of Picea to compete with grasses. Picea growth, however, was reduced by conspecific neighbors in all cases. For Symphoricarpos, conspecific neighbors significantly decreased growth rates with grasses absent but significantly increased growth rates with grasses present. Thus the direct effect of high density in monoculture was to reduce Symphoricarpos growth, but the indirect effect of high density in the presence of grass was to facilitate Symphoricarpos growth. In summary, conspecific neighbors increased the growth rate of Symphoricarpos in competition with grass, and a simulated-forest environment enhanced the ability of Picea to survive in the presence of grasses. The results support the idea that contagious distributions of woody species invading grasslands enhance wooly plant establishment.

AB To evaluate the roles of extinction and isolation in predicting richness and composition of fish assemblages in small forest lakes of Finland and Wisconsin, we analyzed data from 114 Finnish and 55 Wisconsin lakes 0.2-86.9 ha in area. Six isolation variables characterized properties of stream corridors, land barriers, and source pools of invading species; four extinction variables were related to habitat severity, lake area, and productivity. Two types of multivariate analyses were used: the nonparametric classification and regression trees (CART) and the parametric linear discriminant analysis (LDA).
   Both types of analyses showed that extinction variables were collectively more important than isolation variables in predicting richness and composition both in Finland and Wisconsin. We interpret that the greater importance of extinction vs. isolation results, not because isolation is unimportant, but because the probability of an arrival of a new species is much less than that of an extinction. Thus, the time after an extinction event before a subsequent invasion is long relative to the time after an invasion event before a subsequent extinction; consequently, fish assemblages sampled at a given point in time more likely represent the stamp of the extinctions than of the invasions. This conclusion was robust to the differences in the geomorphic settings and fish faunas of Finland and Wisconsin.
   However, the importance of individual isolation and extinction variables in determining richness and composition differed between the two regions, apparently more from differences in geomorphic settings than from differences in fish faunas. Influences of horizontal rather than vertical barriers over land and water were more apparent in Wisconsin, with its lower relief and higher incidence of lakes without stream connections; influences of the area of the nearest lake (representing the size of the available species pool) and stream gradient were more important in Finland, with its higher relief and higher incidence of lakes with stream connections. The importance of individual extinction variables also differed between the two regions, again reflecting differences in the geomorphic settings of the two lake districts and the strong influence that lake position in the landscape has in determining limnological features of the lake.

AB Laboratory growth and feeding experiments were used to study the utilization of nutritionally deficient resources separately and in mixed diets by four Daphnia species and Simocephalus vetulus. All five daphnids exhibited reduced growth and reproduction on pure diets of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus or a P-deficient green alga, Scenedesmus acutus, in comparison to the same concentration (0.5 mg C/L) of high-quality resources. Growth rates on Synechococcus declined markedly over time in 6- and 7-d trials. D. magna fared the best on the cyanobacterium and S. vetulus the worst. In agreement with stoichiometric models, D. pulicaria, the species with the lowest specific P content of body tissues (i.e., highest C:P ratio), was the best species on P-deficient Scenedesmus, whereas S. vetulus, the species with the lowest C:P ratio, was the worst. No evidence was found for a trade-off between maximal growth rate and sensitivity to P limitation. The outcome of competition among daphnids could be influenced by their abilities to utilize the poor-quality resources.
   All five species showed improved growth and reproduction when small quantities (5-20%) of Synechococcus were mixed with P-deficient Scenedesmus. Since Synechococcus is rich in P, these results support the mineral-limitation hypothesis. Moreover, these results are contrary to both the fatty-acid-limitation hypothesis and the digestion-resistance hypothesis. The addition of a phosphate-rich medium rapidly increased the specific P content of P-deficient Scenedesmus, but growth rates of the five daphnids remained 15-23% lower than growth rates with P-sufficient Scenedesmus. Thus, mineral limitation may not entirely account for reduced growth with P-deficient Scenedesmus.
   Experiments with dual-labeled (C-14/(32)p) P-sufficient and P-deficient Scenedesmus revealed no effect of food quality on the ingestion rates of D, pulicaria or S. vetulus. However, in agreement with stoichiometric models, P deficiency enhanced the incorporation of P relative to C. The importance of resource C:P ratios was tested directly by labeling one resource, P-rich Synechococcus or P-deficient Scenedesmus, and altering the C:P ratio of the diet with the alternative, unlabeled resource. P-deficient diets again enhanced P incorporation, whereas mixed diets enhanced C incorporation. Estimates of gross growth efficiencies (growth/ingestion) and P release rates provide further evidence for efficient P incorporation and reduced C incorporation with P-deficient diets. Both the growth and feeding experiments support stoichiometric models for mixed diets of complementary resources.

AB Amphibians exhibit extreme plasticity in the timing of metamorphosis, and several species have been shown to respond to water availability, accelerating metamorphosis when their ponds dry. In this study we analyzed the plasticity of the developmental response to water volume reduction in the western spadefoot toad, Scaphiopus hammondii. Also, we attempted to identify the environmental cue(s) that may signal a desiccating larval habitat. We spawned adults in the laboratory and raised tadpoles in aquaria in a controlled environmental chamber. Water levels of aquaria were gradually reduced by removing water at the rate of 0.5-1 L/d; water in control aquaria was similarly disturbed but not removed. Tadpoles subjected to water volume reduction showed significant acceleration of metamorphosis. The developmental acceleration depended on the rate of reduction of the water level; i.e., tadpoles exhibited a continuum of response. This developmental response did not result from thermal differences between treatments. Furthermore, the response was reversible in that refilling of the aquaria to the starting water level at various times following the onset of volume reduction resulted in restoration of body mass and a tendency to decelerate metamorphosis. Several lines of evidence suggest that the developmental response is due neither to the concentration of compounds in the water nor to chemical or physical interactions among conspecifics. Rather, the response appears to be related to the reduced swimming volume and perhaps the proximity to the water surface. When the water level is reduced, tadpoles reduce foraging, and food restriction of prometamorphic tadpoles maintained in a constant high water environment accelerated metamorphosis. Spadefoot toad tadpoles are a valuable model system for explaining both the proximate mechanisms (environmental cues and physiological responses) and the ultimate causes for adaptive phenotypic plasticity in amphibian metamorphosis.

AB An extensive simulation study was conducted to optimize the number, r, of population members to be encountered from each random starting point in variable area transect (VAT) sampling. The quality of estimation provided by the original calculation formula presented by K. R. Parker in 1979 was compared to another formula that was a Morisita analog intended to reduce bias when sampling aggregated populations. Monte Carlo simulations covered 64 combinations of four spatial patterns, four sample sizes, and four densities. Values of r from 3 through 10 were considered in each case. Relative root mean squared error was used as the primary assessment criterion.
   Superior estimation properties were found for r > 3, but diminishing returns, relative to the potential for increased effort in the field, were found for r > 6. The original estimation formula consistently provided results that were superior to the Morisita analog, with the difference most pronounced in the aggregate patterns for which the Morisita analog was intended. As long as the sampled populations displayed randomness in location of individuals, rather than systematic patterns that are uncommon in nature, the variance formula associated with the original estimation formula performed well.
   Additional simulations were conducted to examine four confidence interval methods for potential use in association with the Parker original estimation method. These simulations considered only the sample sizes for which the best estimation was achieved in the earlier simulations. The confidence interval method developed by Parker worked well for populations with random spatial patterns, but it rarely achieved 80% (generally much less) of target coverage for populations displaying aggregation. A nonparametric confidence interval method presented here, or a combination of it with the Parker method, is recommended for general use.

AB I examined how the performance of Castilleja wightii (Scrophulariaceae), a generalist root parasite, is affected by the availability of different combinations of host species. In this greenhouse study, I focused on pairs of hosts consisting of either two leguminous host individuals (Lupinus arboreus; Fabaceae), two non-nitrogen-fixing hosts (Eriophyllum stachaedifolium; Asteraceae), or one individual of each of these species. Castilleja growth and reproductive performance were greatly improved by the simultaneous attack of two distinct host species, even though Castilleja grown with two Lupinus hosts had significantly higher nitrogen content.
   Different combinations of host species also strongly affected the growth of aphid colonies feeding on the Castilleja used in this experiment. Across all treatments, the growth of aphid colonies was positively correlated with the nitrogen content of the parasitic plants, which, in turn depended on the combination of hosts attacked. Aphid colonies feeding on parasites attacking a mixture of host species grew more slowly than those on parasites attacking two Lupinus individuals. Therefore, simultaneous attack of a mixture of host species may lead to improved parasite performance in two ways-via a direct benefit on parasite growth and flowering as well as a possible indirect benefit because of the relatively poor performance of herbivores feeding on these parasites.

AB I studied the foraging behavior of Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) using radio transmitters, remote receiving stations, and a boat to track individuals. I tested the hypothesis that individual birds exhibit foraging area fidelity. I also investigated evidence for information transfer among birds and the role of tidal cycles in foraging behavior. Flight speed, feeding methods, chick growth rates, and hedging success were similar for radio-tagged birds and birds without radio-tags, suggesting that radio-tags had no significant effect. Birds made an average of two foraging trips per day for 13 d, during a spring and a neap tide series. Twenty-four of 26 birds returned repeatedly ((X) over bar = 19.2 trips) to particular areas to feed; these birds were considered faithful to a foraging area. During spring and neap tides, 17 and 14 birds, repsectively, times their foraging trips to coincide with daily tidal cycles. Foraging area fidelity indicates that kittiwakes learn and remember when and where to forage and therefore may gain local knowledge of their foraging area. Individuals possessing such knowledge may have an advantage over individuals without local knowledge. Foraging area fidelity in individuals indicates that information transfer among colonial seabirds may be less important than previously expected. Birds were selective in joining feeding flocks (13 of 35 flocks were joined). Those that were joined most often were large feeding flocks that occurred in the birds' preferred feeding areas. Birds often fed alone (n = 26 observations) rather than with feeding flocks (n = 9 observations). Individuals of a mated pair did not forage in the same area, suggesting that information transfer regarding foraging did not occur between mates. Some mates were unable to coordinate their tidally timed foraging with nesting activities, and chicks were left unattended, which may have reduced the number of chicks fledged. Such gaps in attendance may reflect why birds such as kittiwakes have delayed maturation and poor reprodctive success during the first few years of breeding.

AB Populations of Proechimys semispinosus (Central American spiny rat) were provisioned with fresh native fruits for 6 mo to test the hypothesis that populations of frugivorous rodents in seasonal Neotropical forests are not limited by food during the season of greatest resource abundance. Islands in the Panama Canal were used as experimental systems so that results would not be confounded by individuals commuting from the fringes of the study areas. Populations isolated on four islands were censused by monthly live-trapping and served as unmanipulated controls, while populations isolated on four additional islands were provisioned with fruit at 315.2 kg/ha and censused by similar methods. Natural fruit abundance was concurrently censused by counting numbers of fruiting trees and lianas to account for naturally available resources. Means of overall spiny rat density and density of known births were compared between treatment groups using repeated-measures analysis of covariance, with the density of fruiting trees and lianas as the covariate. Both variables showed a treatment effect, with higher-than-expected densities and densities of births within experimental populations based on natural resource abundance. Numbers of known births per adult female were compared between treatment groups by constructing a log-linear model. This model also revealed a treatment effect. with per capita production of young being higher within all experimental populations. Monthly survival rates of young and adults were compared between treatment groups by constructing separate linear models for young and adults, and no treatment effect was evident. Adult male body mass was compared among islands by analysis of variance and similarly showed no treatment effect. Results showed that these spiny rat populations were limited by food even during the period of high resource abundance, and increased densities were due to increased production and recruitment of young rather than to increased immigration or survival.

AB This paper reports evidence for family effects (i.e., nonindependence between siblings) on components of juvenile fitness in two high-performance populations of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). In Trois Fontaines (eastern France), 51 sets of twins were ear-tagged as newborns and then intensively monitored until adulthood (to greater than or equal to 4 yr of age). On the island of Storfosna (central western Norway), 79 sets of twins and 40 sets of triplets were radiotracked from birth to greater than or equal to 1 mo of age. In both populations, family effects were observed for measures of early body development and winter body mass. Measurements for sibling fawns were more similar than the same measures for nonsiblings. During unfavorable years (i.e., poor deer survival in summer or high population density), sibling fawns survived or died together much more often than expected by chance. Conversely, during favorable years (i.e., high fawn survival or low density), there was no evidence for family effects on survival of either twins or triplets. These results demonstrate that family effects on juvenile fitness of roe deer are pervasive, and that family effects on early survival differ among years. To assess the consequences of family effects an population dynamics, we tested the model of J. F. Crow and N. E. Morton. This model proposes that family effects should cause increased variance in recruitment among females. Consistent with this model, Family effects led to a threefold increase in the variance of total reproductive success over 5 yr of 37 females in Trois Fontaines. Data from Storfosna (11 females monitored for 3 yr) also supported Crow and Morton's model. Ultimately, family effects in polytocous species could reduce the intensity of sexual selection and modify the genetic structure of populations.

AB Many female insects receive material during mating, referred to as "nuptial gifts," that may increase the female's resource budget. This investigation examines how nuptial gifts influence female nitrogen and carbon budgets ina polyandrous butterfly, Pieris napi. During mating, a virgin male of this species transfers a large and nutritious ejaculate containing 14% nitrogen by dry mass. The amount of nitrogen transferred is equivalent to that in similar to 70 eggs. Females use the male-transferred nutrients to increase their pool of nutrients used for egg production and show a positive relationship between amount of ejaculate material received and lifetime reproductive output. It is clear that for multiply mated females, nitrogen derived from male nuptial gifts is essential for a balanced nitrogen budget. As in earlier studies, female thorax mass decreased with age, indicating that old females of P. napi are able to use more of the resources from their thorax than young females. Since male-transferred material also increases female longevity, multiply mated females also use more of their resources from the thorax. Consequently, multiply mated females have a relatively higher reproductive investment than singly mated females, i.e., they transform a larger part of their body reserves to egg production. These results are important for studies that involve male-transferred nutrients in female life history patterns as well as for investigations of links between nuptial gifts and sexual selection theory. When the value of nuptial gifts is determined only on the nutritional value of the gift itself rather than the function within the female, there is an obvious risk for incorrect conclusions.

In the first large-scale vertebrate predator manipulation experiment with sufficient replication, densities of small mustelids (the least weasel Mustela nivalis and the stoat M. erminea) and avian predators (mainly the Eurasian Kestrel Falco tinnunculus and Tengmalm's Owl Aegolius funereus) were reduced in six different areas, 2-3 km(2) each, in two crash phases (1992 and 1995) of the 3-yr cycle of voles (field vole Microtus agrestis, sibling vole M, rossiaemeridionalis, and bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus). The reduction of all main predators reversed the decline in density of small rodents in the subsequent summer, whereas in areas with least weasel reduction and in control areas without predator manipulation, small rodent densities continued to decline. That only reduction of all main predators was sufficient to prevent this summer crash was apparently because least weasels represent <40% of vole-eating predators in western Finland. These results provide novel evidence for the hypothesis that specialist predators drive a summer decline of cyclic rodent populations in northern Europe.

AB The formation of foraging groups is likely to result from individual decisions constrained by spatial distribution of food and number of foragers. Foraging groups may form via different mechanisms depending on the absolute levels of at least two relative spatial scales. I present four group size models for environments composed of two nested patch scales. Second-order patches contain first-order patches that correspond to food patches. Individuals within a given second-order patch are able to monitor their conspecifics' behavior, and the number of individuals attending a first-order patch defines group size. I then test the models' predictions with Parasitic Jaegers (Stercorarius parasiticus) kleptoparasitizing fish from Common Terns (Sterna hirundo). In this context, tern fishing grounds and flying terns that carried fish correspond to the jaegers' second and first-order patches, respectively. The Dispersion and Aggregation models assume that foragers have perfect knowledge of the spatial distribution of food and form groups in conformity to an ideal free distribution. The Producer-Scrounger (PS) and Information-Sharing (IS) models, however, assume that foragers are unaware of the food patches' location and form groups as some foragers join and exploit the food discoveries of others. I used four fitness currencies: probability of obtaining a fish, PF; gross and net rates of energy intake; and energy efficiency. All currencies decreased with group size except the PF currency, which did not vary for group sizes of one and two. Because fitness never increased with group size, the Aggregation model was ruled out. Fish-securing rates of jaegers that initiated and joined chases did not differ. Assuming that initiating and joining a chase correspond to a producing and a scrounging event, respectively, both the PS and IS model then predict that group size should match jaeger abundance. Because group size leveled rapidly with jaeger abundance, both models were discarded. The Dispersion model predicts that group size should decrease with an increase in tern availability when the latter is limiting. Otherwise, jaegers should not form groups unless there is no cost to do so, such as with the PF currency in which solitary jaegers and pairs experience equal fitness. The facts that group size did not reach 1.0 at high tern availability and that it averaged 1.5 when it did not decrease further with tern availability suggest that jaegers may form groups according to the Dispersion model with the PF currency. This conclusion is discussed in relation to the other assumptions underlying the Dispersion model.

AB I conducted field experiments in a western New York marsh to quantify concurrently the impacts of resource limitation and predation on benthic midge populations (Chironomus plumosus, Chironomus tentans, and Glyptotendipes barbipes). Biomass of cattail litter (Typha sp.), numbers of small insectivorous fish (primarily juvenile carp, Cyprinus carpio, and to a lesser extent juvenile brown bullhead, Ictalurus nebulosus), or numbers of large fish (primarily adult brown bullhead, which will consume both midges and small fish) were manipulated in mesh-walled mesocosms (1.5 x 1.5 x 1.2 m). Using core sampling, midge population responses to manipulations were monitored from early May through late August.
   Trophic responses of marsh midges to resources and predation changed temporally over the summer. In June, neither resource limitation nor predation by fish significantly influenced midge numbers. In July, after juvenile carp and brown bullhead first became abundant from the spawn, these small insectivorous fish significantly reduced midge larval densities. At that time, midge densities still did not respond to variable detritus supplies. By August, both predation by small fish and available supplies of cattail litter significantly affected midge numbers. Because midges did not respond to a nonnutritive mimic of cattail litter, it suggests that resource limitation of midge abundance was nutritionally based. Feeding by large adult bullhead had no apparent direct or indirect influence on midge densities in any month. Small fish largely disappeared from the study habitats by August, but populations of midge larvae did not rebound because they had stopped breeding for that year. This study supports emerging concepts on the integrated influences of top-down and bottom-up trophic interaction on food web function. Predation and resource limitation were simultaneously influencing midge abundance. Results also emphasize how life history phenologies of predators and prey can contribute to temporal variation in food web structure and function.

   DEMOGRAPHY
AB To test two hypotheses for mast fruiting, i.e., (1) pollination efficiency and (2) pre-dispersal predator satiation, we investigated annual fluctuation in seed production and demography From flower to seed of four Carpinus species (family Betulaceae). We monitored flowering, seed production, and seed fall for seven years (1987-1993) for Carpinus laxiflora, C., tschonoskii, C. japonica, and C. cordata, which co occur in a temperate deciduous forest, Ogawa a Forest Reserve, central Japan. We also monitored the seasonal development of pistillate aments in 1995. These Carpinus species are known to show highly synchronized, fluctuating annual seed production, Total seed production (the sum of sound seeds, reeds suffering predation, empty seeds, and immature seeds) was proportional to the quantity of staminate aments and was synchronized among the four species during the observation period, The percentage of mature seeds (the sum of sound seeds and seeds suffering predation) out of the total seed production was positively correlated with annual staminate ament production. This result supports the pollination efficiency hypothesis. The observation that most ovaries in this study did not fall after the pollination season and grew into normal, mature-sized seeds irrespective of fertilization (empty or not) also supports the hypothesis. The percentage of seeds suffering predation by insects significantly decreased in relation to sound seed production, suggesting that predator satiation also operated for these Carpinus species, Lf the four species have common seed predators (possibly some curculionid species), mutually synchronized fluctuation of seed production among them would be effective for escaping from pre-dispersal predation.

AB The Shenandoah salamander, Plethonon shenandoah, is a federally endangered species that is restricted to Pleistocene-age talus on three mountains in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, USA. Each population is surrounded by the red-backed salamander, P. cinereus, which defends intraspecific territories on the forest floor. On Hawksbill Mountain, P. shenandoah consists of a metapopulation, with a large "source" subpopulation on the top of the mountain and at least five small "sink" subpopulations below. Here we report that P. shenandoah is constrained in escaping from the talus into deep soil, and thus in emigrating from source to sink subpopulations, by interspecific territoriality from P. cinereus. We performed competitive release experiments during two summers by removing P. cinereus from under experimental rocks while leaving territorial residents in place under control rocks. Plethodon shenandoah responded by invading experimental rocks significantly more frequently than control rocks in both years. Quadrat analyses indicated that only a small number of individuals escaped from the talus at any given time. Behavioral experiments revealed no significant differences in propensity to bite by the two species, indicating that more subtle tactics are employed by P. cinereus in excluding P. shenandoah from territorial sites. One sink subpopulation of P. shenandoah became extinct in 1970 as a consequence of a severe drought, which affected areas of talus more drastically than areas of deep soil containing P. cinereus. Our data now suggest that interspecific territoriality by P. cinereus can contribute to the extinction-prone status of P, shenandoah by inhibiting movements from source to more distant sink subpopulations.

AB Crossbills (genus Loxia) are thought to breed opportunistically whenever food is abundant. If strictly true, this would distinguish them from most temperate zone birds that use photoperiod and supplementary cues (e.g., temperature, food supply) to time changes in reproductive physiology and behavior. I describe patterns of changing reproductive physiology in free-living Red Crossbills (Loxia curvirostra) as functions of season and conifer phenology. Nonbreeding spring migrants had elevated plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and began gonadal development prior to finding a summer breeding site. The birds began breeding in July while feeding on maturing seeds of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). Circulating LH declined in August, and gonads regressed completely as molt accelerated in September, although seed availability was at an annual high. Slight gonadal growth occurred after molt in late autumn and early winter, but reproductive maturation and nesting did not occur during winter in this study, possibly because western hemlock cones had shed most of their seeds. Winter/spring breeding (reproductive opportunism) at other locations was inferred from the presence of independent juveniles in early summer. Thus, activation of the reproductive system in summer and termination of breeding during molt in autumn appear to be regular seasonal phenomena in Red Crossbills, as in other temperate zone birds. Their opportunistic capabilities are superimposed on this underlying pattern.

AB Approximately 50% of the variation in productivity in lakes is hypothesized to depend upon the cascading effects of top predators. A relative paucity of evidence for such trophic cascades in terrestrial systems has prompted proposals that resource availability (donor control) is more critical than are top-down forces in structuring terrestrial communities, and that trophic cascades with top-down dominance will be restricted to systems of low species diversity. To test the effects of a fourth trophic level on successive lower trophic levels under different levels of plant resource availability, we used Piper ant-plants and their associated arthropods as a model system in lowland, tropical rain forest. This interacting web of four trophic levels is composed of small trees, various herbivores, predaceous ants, and specialist clerid beetles as predators of ants.
   Three-hundred-sixty Piper cenocladum cuttings were randomly assigned to 36 plots with a factorial design: predator treatment (three levels), light treatment (two levels), and soil type (two levels). We monitored indicators of ant-colony size (percentage petioles occupied per tree), herbivore loads (leaf area loss), and tree biomass (total leaf area per tree) for 18 mo. When the top predator Tarsobaenus letourneauae was added experimentally to the three-trophic-level ant-plant system, the average abundance of Pheidole bicornis ants was reduced fivefold, average herbivory to Piper cenocladum leaves was increased nearly threefold, and tree leaf area was reduced by nearly half. Direct effects of predatory beetles on ants were more pronounced and more rapid than were indirect effects accumulating to the second and first trophic levels. Bottom-up effects of light and soil quality tended to be mitigated by these top-down cascades. Neither potential leaf-area accumulation by trees nor actual leaf area (left after herbivory) showed a direct response to relatively high or low availability of soil nutrients or light at different sites.

AB We investigated the environmental factors providing signals for gamete re lease in fucoid algae, with a particular focus on the inhibitory effect of water motion. The release of gametes by Focus distichus occurred in still water under high light and was associated with the depletion of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in tide pools isolated from the ocean during daytime low tides. Diurnal patterns of gamete release that lasted for 2-3 d, as in natural populations, were found in receptacles cultured in a 12 h light:12 h dark photoperiod under calm conditions or in a simulated tidal regime. Constant light disrupted the diurnal component of release, however, suggesting that an endogenous circadian periodicity was absent. The effects of increased [DIC] on cultured receptacles under calm conditions were similar to the inhibitory effects of high water motion; both conditions reduced release in several species from both tide pool and intertidal habitats. Bicarbonate concentration, rather than carbon dioxide, or carbonate, was shown to be the component of the DIC system most closely correlated (inversely) with gamete release in the intertidal fucoid Pelvetia compressa. The hypothesis that gamete release is triggered by DIC depletion in the unstirred boundary layer during periods of low water motion in the light was further supported by experiments with P. compressa. These showed that gamete release was not inhibited by high water motion when DIC was absent. In the same experiments, high water motion inhibited release at 2 and 20 mmol/L DIC, confirming that the sensitivity of gamete release to water motion is DIC dependent. The ability of fucoid algae to couple physiological processes (e.g., photosynthesis) with life history events (gamete release) allows external fertilization to occur under favorable hydrodynamic conditions, and may contribute greatly to reproductive success in organisms inhabiting periodically turbulent environments.

AB Maternal nutritional stress lowers the organic content of egg and slows the initial growth of larvae of sea urchins and bivalves. Also, larval nutritional stress changes the form and developmental sequence of larvae as an adjustment to scarce food. If effects of nutrient supplies in eggs were like those of nutrient supplies in planktonic food, then maternal nutrition would affect larval form and developmental plasticity in the same way as larval nutrition. We used natural variation in maternal habitat to test this hypothesis, using laboratory growth experiments. In the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, mothers from greater depth (100 m) had smaller ovaries and smaller eggs than mothers from shallower depth (<6 m), which indicated poorer maternal nutrition at depth. Effects of maternal habitat, gonad size, and egg size on larval growth rate were significant but small compared to the effect of abundance of larval food. The growth of larvae was little affected by differences in maternal habitat that had a large effect on fecundity and some effect on egg size. There were no effects on larval body or juvenile rudiment that resembled the developmental plasticity in response to larval food. Food-limited mothers did not produce larvae with larger larval feeding apparatus or retarded development of juvenile rudiments. Uncoupled morphogenetic effects of endogenous and exogenous nutrients should be advantageous where benthic and planktonic food supplies vary independently. Finely tuned responses to stimuli may restrict the evolutionary consequences of developmental plasticity. Because maternal nutrition did not affect form of the larvae, larval form can be used at on index of planktonic conditions affecting feeding larvae.

AB We define the "developmental stream" of a plant as the gradient of increasingly mature phenotypes its shoots express over its lifetime. This pattern has important implications for studies of morphology, physiology, reproduction, and interactions with other organisms, Using cottonwoods, we test two major hypotheses about their developmental streams, First, within a tree, the developmental stage expressed by a shoot is dependent on its growth distance from the ground. Second, the distribution and fitness of Pemphigus betae, an aphid that is sensitive to host maturity, an positively related to increasingly mature shoot phenotypes within a tree, We show that the developmental variation in plant morphology and reproductive output within a tree are as great as that found among different-aged trees within a clone, In addition, we show that within-tree patterns of variation are stable from year to year and that P. betae responds to this variation by preferentially colonizing branches expressing more mature phenotypes. This pattern of branch selection is adaptive; aphids transferred to branches with shoots expressing mature phenotypes have expected fitnesses >80% higher than those transferred to branches expressing juvenile phenotypes.
   These findings have several general implications. First, a within-tree series of developmental stages provides a heritable mechanism for creating mosaics of variability in host duality within plants that create host selection problems for herbivores. Second, herbivores sensitive to developmental changes in their hosts will be concentrated in areas of high quality where they will be subject to the detrimental effects of competition, predation, and parasitism, Third, simulation models of plant growth based on the behavior of repeating plant parts (e.g., shoots) must be sensitive to developmental changes in these parts during plant development, Fourth, the developmental streams of plants may affect the evolution of such herbivore traits as territoriality, deme formation, and virulence. Fifth, the use of clonally propagated stock for the study of the genetic components of resistance to herbivory must be carried out with an understanding of the effects of host development on herbivores.

AB Trophic-dynamic theories predict the biomass and productivity of trophic levels to be partially top-down regulated in food webs, and that the top-down regulation will manifest itself as cascading trophic interactions. We tested the two principal predictions deduced from these theories: trophic cascades of(1)biomass regulation and (2) productivity regulation occur in food webs.
   We created three food webs with either one, two, or three trophic levels in soil microcosms containing a sterilized mixture of leaf litter and humus. Twenty species of bacteria and fungi formed the first trophic level, a bacterivorous nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans) and a fungivorous nematode (Aphelenchoides sp.) the second level, and a predatory nematode (Prionchulus punctatus) the third level. We sampled the microcosms destructively four times during a 5-mo experiment for estimations of the biomass of each of the trophic levels. CO2 evolution was analyzed once or twice a week,; and NH4+-N concentration in the soil was measured at the end of the: experiment. Glucose was added to the microcosms every second week to provide energy for the microbes. The biomass of microbivores was clearly regulated by the predator. The: abundance of bacteria was not affected by the food chain length, and the abundance of fungi was higher in the presence of nematodes than in the pure microbial community. Net mineralization of N and C was highest in the food chains with two trophic levels, at an intermediate level in the presence of predators, and lowest in the pure microbial communities. Microbial production (estimated on the basis of microbial respiration) was higher in the food webs with two and three trophic levels than when the microbes were growing alone. Whether the biomass of the second trophic level was reduced by the predator or not had no effect on microbial biomass or microbial productivity.
   Therefore, although the microbivore biomass and mineralization of both C and N were regulated by the predator, our experiment did not provide evidence of cascading trophic interactions regulating the microbial biomass and productivity in decomposer food webs. The facts that microbes were able to compensate totally for the consumed biomass by increasing their turnover rate and that the microbes did not behave as a uniform trophic level prevented a trophic cascade of biomass regulation from occurring in our soil food web. Similarly, since microbial productivity did not depend on the biomass at the second trophic level, neither did a trophic cascade of productivity regulation take place.

AB A number of species of forest caterpillars fluctuate in density with a periodicity of 8-11 yr. One explanation for these "cycles" is that changes in food quality or quantity and crowding influence the growth rate and final size of moths at high density. Carryover of these influences to the next generation through maternal effects could modify the dynamics of the population. To determine whether development, survival, pupal size, fecundity, or sex ratio varied among offspring of gypsy moths from high- and low-density populations, we collected eggs from three sites where moths had been at low density and three sites where moth density had been high for several years. We reared caterpillars hatching from these eggs in the laboratory under controlled conditions. Sex ratio was the only characteristic to vary in a consistent way with the density of the maternal population. Egg masses from low-density sites produced significantly more females than those from high-density sites, for which the numbers of males and females were equal or slightly in favor of males. The female bias of the sex ratio of low-density populations increases the potential rate of increase of the population and may arise from local mate competition when populations are sparse. The reduced rate of increase in high-density populations associated with the higher production of males could delay the recovery of populations following decline. Whether the sex-ratio deviation observed in low density populations persists should be studied in the future.

AB Herbivores can often control plant dynamics by mediating positive feedbacks in plant species' influence on nutrient cycling. In a 7-yr field experiment in a nitrogen-limited Minnesota oak savanna, we tested whether herbivores accelerated or decelerated nitrogen (N) cycling through their effects on plants. We measured effects of excluding insect (primarily Orthoptera and Homoptera) and mammalian herbivores (primarily white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus) on above-and belowground plant biomass, plant species composition, plant tissue nitrogen concentration, available soil N and light, and total N and carbon (C) in different pools (soil, roots, litter, etc.). Herbivore exclusion strongly increased cover and biomass of the legume Lathyrus venosus and a few species of woody plants. These effects were associated with greater aboveground standing crop, reduced belowground standing crop, and reduced light penetration to the ground surface. Herbivore exclusion also modified N cycling through greater N content of live, aboveground plant tissue early in the growing season and of Litter and belowground tissue late in the growing season. Herbivore exclusion also increased soil nitrate and total available N concentrations but did not alter total soil or plant N. Our results support the hypothesis that herbivores indirectly decelerate N cycling by decreasing the abundance of plant species with nitrogen-rich tissues. However, other factors, ;such as disturbance from fire, may mediate herbivore effects on long-term changes in N and C pools. Herbivores may therefore indirectly control productivity, N cycling, and succession by consuming nitrogen-fixing and woody plants that have strong effects on plant resources (e.g., nitrogen and light).

AB The record of forest invasion by eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) during the course of Holocene migration provides useful information about invasion processes in temperate forest, a system that has been invaded by few exotic species. We used fossil pollen preserved in small forest hollows, which record forest composition on the scale of 1-3 ha, to study hemlock invasion of forests in the Sylvania Wilderness in the upper peninsula of Michigan, where there is now a mosaic of 3-30 ha stands dominated either by hemlock or by sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and basswood (Tilia americana). Fossil pollen was interpreted by comparison with 66 surface samples from small hollows in Michigan and Wisconsin, using three different statistical methods: pollen ratios, a dissimilarity index, and canonical variates analysis (CVA) ordination. We found that four hemlock stands along a 10-km transect across Sylvania originated as patches of white pine (Pinus strobus) forest that were invaded by hemlock similar to 3000 yr ago (calibrated C-14 dating) when hemlock expanded its range in northern Michigan. Invasion occurred at about the same time (within 800 yr) at all sites but was not associated with disturbance at any site. Over the next several thousand years hemlock coexisted with white pine, but eventually, at a time that differs from site to site, hemlock became dominant, and white pine disappeared from all but one of the four stands. These changes were apparently driven by climate changes over the last 4000 yr that caused the water table to rise (Brugam and Johnson 1997). The history of four nearby maple stands is more variable and less well understood. Unlike the hemlock stands, three of the four maple patches were not dominated by pine at the time of hemlock invasion, but instead had abundant oak (Quercus) and/or maple. Two of these stands were not invaded by hemlock, and the third, if invaded at all, was invaded for a few centuries by low densities of hemlock trees. Thus invasion by hemlock was sensitive to the species composition of the resident forest. Sugar maple and basswood increased in these stands, and by 2000 to 800 yr ago, depending on site, they resembled modern maple stands. The fourth patch was invaded by hemlock, but it was converted to a maple stand 1000-500 yr ago. A wood layer in the sediment is evidence that a catastrophic windstorm may have been responsible.

AB In size-structured populations, prey have the potential to restrict the recruitment of their predator by decreasing the growth rate of young predators through interspecific competition, a situation referred to as a ''competitive juvenile bottleneck.'' Two mechanisms have been advanced by which a decrease in growth may increase the mortality of young predators: (1) increased time during which juvenile predators are susceptible to gape-limited predation and (2) increased susceptibility to starvation. To study the effects of competition from a prey fish (roach, Rutilus rutilus) on the recruitment of a piscivorous fish (perch, Perca fluviatilis), roach were introduced in two of four small adjacent unproductive lakes inhabited by natural populations of perch. We thereafter studied the diet, growth, and survival of the new-born cohorts of perch during a 13-mo period.
   Growth and survival of larval perch were not affected by roach whereas during the latter part of the growing season, growth and condition of young-of-the-year (YOY) perch were negatively affected by roach. The growth retardation of YOY perch in roach-treatment lakes coincided with a shift in diet from free-swimming zooplankton to benthic cladocerans and chironomids, which in turn was related to a stronger decline in pelagic zooplankton resources in these lakes. The small size and poor condition of YOY perch in the roach-treatment lakes resulted in almost all these perch dying from starvation during the winter and subsequent spring. There was a tendency for there to be higher densities of YOY perch in the roach-treatment lakes, possibly due to a strong die-off of adult perch in these lakes that in turn may have reduced cannibalism in these lakes. The results from an enclosure experiment on intra-cohort competition among YOY perch, however, suggested that the discrepancy in growth of YOY perch between the lakes was mainly due to direct competition from roach for the zooplankton resource.
   Temporal variation in competition intensity and in duration of periods for growth and energy gain (e.g., summer) vs. periods of only energy loss (e.g., winter) are suggested to have major effects on juvenile predator growth and subsequent recruitment to the adult stage through competitive juvenile bottlenecks, and thus to affect overall community dynamics. The relative importance of size-dependent winter starvation mortality compared to mortality caused by gape-limited predators as a mortality agent on juveniles is hypothesized to increase with latitude. Whole-lake experiments lend themselves both to testing the importance in natural systems of mechanisms previously identified at small spatial and short temporal scales, and also to identifying important mechanisms that cannot be studied at smaller scales.

AB The mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, develops only within the water-filled leaves of the purple Ditcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea, where it overwinters in larval diapause. We reared uniform-aged cohorts in the leaves of intact plants in three environments: near-optimal summer conditions, intentionally stressful summer conditions, and a 23-wk simulated winter. Overwintering W. smithii suffered a 60% loss in fitness (R-0), comparable to the 68% loss in fitness imposed by the summer stress. Overwintering cohorts lost fitness through reduced survivorship, fecundity, fertility, adult longevity, and mass-specific fecundity. We argue that very real trade-offs occur between summer performance and winter performance among temperate insects in general. Survivorship and reproduction of the overwintering generation should therefore be an important source of selection shaping not only the seasonal expression of dormancy, but also the evolution of summer life-history syndromes as well.

AB Understanding the factors that determine community structure remains one of the most important issues in ecology. In this paper, we examine the role of flow velocities in governing community structure in marine intertidal communities. We broaden the traditional definition of "bottom-up" forces to include the delivery of nutrients, food, and larval resources to habitats and then test the hypothesis that, by controlling these fluxes as well as mediating predator effects, flow velocities leave strong bottom-up signatures on shoreline communities.
   We examined this hypothesis by quantifying community structure and dynamics at high and low flow sites in a tidal estuary in Maine. High flow sizes were characterized by dense barnacle and mussel cover, while low flow sites had considerable bare space. High flow sites also had greater grazer and predator densities than low flow sites. Recruitment of all common shoreline organisms with planktonic larvae was greater at high flow sites, in direct proportion to the increased fluid flux there. Flow effects on the growth of the herbivorous and carnivorous components of the food web were less predictable. High Bows increased the growth of barnacles, but not mussels, and increased the growth of the carnivorous gastropods that preyed on them. In contrast, high flows decreased the accumulation of benthic diatoms, but this was unrelated to the growth rates of herbivorous gastropods. High flow sites were universally characterized by low predation intensity and per capita predation rates on all three prey species.
   Our results show that the strength of top-down and bottom-up forces varies with flow rate in this estuary. Consumer stress (top-down) models accurately explain patterns we saw at low flow sites, but bottom-up processes predicted from nutrient/productivity models dominate at high Bow sites. High consumer pressure is the dominant structuring force at low flow sites, whereas at high flow sites predators are inhibited, and individual recruitment and growth rates become the dominant structuring forces. We suggest that hydrodynamics may commonly decouple predation and resource processes in many aquatic systems when the physical process responsible for variation in top-down forces also acts as a strong bottom-up force.

In a field experiment we manipulated natural burdens of five nematode species via anthelmintic treatment in one-half the free-ranging snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) on each of six study areas and supplemented overwinter food level on three areas, to assess whether treatments interacted synergistically. We predicted that the effects of parasitism would be aggravated in malnourished hares (i.e., hares not administered supplemental food), and that animals receiving both treatments would have (1) lower parasite burdens, and (2) higher body mass, fat storage, and reproduction, than those receiving only one or no treatments. Mean numbers of Trichuris leporis were lower in hares subjected to food supplementation, suggesting that nutritional status affected immunity to that species. Obeliscoides cuniculi, Nematodirus triangularis, Dirofilaria scapiceps, and Protostrongylus boughtoni numbers were not directly affected by supplementation. Body mass of parasite-normal controls (i.e., not administered the anthelmintic treatment) was negatively correlated to nematode abundance during May-June, implying that parasitism had a deleterious effect on hare mass at that time. However, the anthelmintic treatment failed to directly affect hare body mass, fat storage, or reproduction. Food supplementation had a positive effect on body mass, fat storage, and reproduction, although effects of food were neither strong nor consistent among study areas and body condition parameters being measured. Only 2 of 22 analyses of hare production yielded marginally significant (i.e., 0.05 < P < 0.10) interactions between food and parasitism; therefore, we concluded that the two factors were not strongly linked. However, because our snowshoe hare population was at low densities and likely exposed to neither severe food shortage nor high rates of nematode parasitism, failure to detect an interaction between treatments may not comprise a general refutation of the hypothesis. Rather, hare populations subject to more serious food limitation (i.e., during a cyclic peak in numbers) may be apt to display stronger interactions between nutrition and parasitism.

AB Afforestation in the tropics may sequester soil C and has been proposed as a management tool to aid in controlling rising levels of atmospheric CO2. We measured changes in soil C following afforestation of sugarcane fields with fast-growing Eucalyptus saligna (Sm.) plantations in Hawaii. Using stable C isotopes, we estimated the contributions to changes in total soil C that were due to the loss of C from the prior cane cultivation, and to the gain of C from the new Eucalyptus plantations. Total soil C 10-13 yr after afforestation was 114 and 113 Mg/ha, respectively, in the Eucalyptus and cane plantation. Eucalyptus increased total soil C in the 0-10 cm layer by 11.5 Mg/ha, but that was offset by a loss of 10.1 Mg/ha of cane-derived C from the 10-55 cm layer. The net effect on soil C of afforestation of cultivated lands depends not only on new C gained, but also on C lost from the previous management.

AB We used a spatial survey of fish assemblage structure in streams and beaver ponds to: (1) determine the effects of beavers on fish assemblage structure at the reach and drainage basin scales, and (2) assess the influences of pond age, watershed position, and pond environment on fish assemblage structure within beaver ponds. Stream impoundment by beavers affected species richness at the reach scale, but this effect was highly dependent on pond age and drainage area above the pond. In headwater streams, species richness per pond increased to a high in ponds 9-17 yr old and then decreased to a low in ponds >17 yr old. Farther downstream, species richness showed little change with pond age. Assemblage structure varied significantly among unimpounded, impounded, and previously impounded stream reaches, and variation in assemblage structure among ponds was related to pond age and physical habitat. In large ponds there was a shift from lotic to lentic species, and as ponds aged, small-bodied minnows were replaced by larger predators. Because there was high species turnover among impounded and previously impounded reaches, beavers affected patterns of species richness at the drainage basin scale; we collected more species in first-and second-order streams (32 and 38, respectively) than in third-order streams (26). Taken together these results indicate: (1) that beavers have a positive effect on fish species richness in low-order, blackwater streams, but maintenance of this effect requires preservation of both spatial and temporal dynamics of beaver pond creation and abandonment, and (2) the positive relationship between stream fish species richness and drainage area described for many streams may be a recent phenomenon resulting from the extirpation of beavers from much of their historical range.

AB Within many ecological systems, relationships between controlling factors and associated response variables are complex. In many cases, the response should vary little when the controlling factor exerts strong effects. Conversely, when the effect of the controlling factor is weak or absent, the response may vary greatly with effects of other factors. Correlation or regression analyses often may not be appropriate for testing these relationships, because variance of the response changes with values of the controlling factor. We suggest using a technique from the astronomy literature, a two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov (2DKS) test, to detect relationships in bivariate data with these patterns of variance. This technique successfully identified simulated bivariate data composed of paired independent values as having nonsignificant relationships and simulated bivariate data in which mean and variance of y was constrained at high levels of x as having significant relationships. Using these simulations and examples from aquatic and terrestrial systems, we demonstrate that the 2DKS is a robust test for detecting nonrandom patterns in bivariate distributions that commonly arise in many ecological systems.

AB Animals gain fitness benefits if they can increase their survival prospects by reducing mobility under temporarily high predation risk. We used miniature radio collars to determine whether mobility affects the risk of predation on breeding field voles (Microtus agrestis) and sibling voles (M. rossiaemeridionalis) by their main predators, small carnivores, in a population with cyclically fluctuating numbers and predation risk. There was a significant association of mobility with predation risk: voles killed by small carnivores moved more than did voles that survived. An experimental reduction of predation risk significantly affected vole mobility: voles moved more under reduced predation risk. Sex, season, and phase of the vole cycle explained a similar or larger proportion of the observed variation in the number of billed voles than did mobility. Carnivores killed more female than male voles, predation risk was higher in the decline phase than in the increase phase of the cycle, and predation risk was also higher in spring than in early summer. However, voles cannot change sex, season, or the phase of their cycle, whereas they can alter their mobility. These results offer novel observational and experimental support for the hypothesis that animals may increase their survival prospects by reducing mobility. The female-biased prey choice of small carnivores implies that they have a stronger impact on prey population dynamics than avian predators, which have previously been shown to kill more than females.

AB Topography controls snowpack accumulation and hence growing-season length, soil water availability, and the distribution of plant communities in the Colorado Front Range alpine. Nutrient cycles in such an environment are likely to be regulated by interactions between topographically determined climate and plant species composition. We investigated variation in plant and soil components of internal N cycling across topographic gradients of dry, moist, and wet alpine tundra meadows at Niwot Ridge, Colorado. We expected that plant production and N cycling would increase from dry to wet alpine tundra meadows, but we hypothesized that variation in N turnover would span a proportionately greater range than productivity, because of feedbacks between plants and soil microbial processes that determine N availability. Plant production of foliage and roots increased over topographic sequences from 280 g.m(-2).yr(-1) in dry meadows to 600 g.m(-2).yr(-1) in wet meadows and was significantly correlated to soil moisture. Contrary to our expectation, plant N uptake for production increased to a lesser degree, from 3.9 g N . m(-2).yr(-1) in dry meadows to 6.8 g N . m(-2).yr(-1) in wet meadows. In all communities, the belowground component accounted for the majority of biomass, production, and N use for production. Allocation belowground also differed among communities, accounting for 70% of total production and 80% of N use for production in dry meadows compared to 55% of production and 65% of N use for production in moist meadows. Variation in microbial processes was highly related to soil moisture, and we found very consistent relationships among microbial respiration, gross N mineralization, and N immobilization among communities. These results indicate that the topographic soil moisture gradient is in fundamental control of the patterns of N turnover among communities and that differences in plant species do not appear to be as important.

AB Interactions among predators can a have substantial effect on the total impact of the predator complex. We investigated the interaction between foliar-foraging (Coccinella septempunctata) and ground-foraging (Harpalus pennsylvanicus) predators of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) in a series of laboratory and field experiments. The intensity and direction of the interaction were determined by comparing the combined and individual impacts of both predators.
   In a laboratory mesocosm, the combined predation rate of both predators was nearly double the sum of their individual predation rates. The mechanism for the interaction was the aphid "dropping" behavior elicited by C. septempunctata, which rendered the aphids susceptible to predation by H. pennsylvanicus on the ground. The strength of the synergistic interaction increased with increasing prey density. The interaction between the predators was also demonstrated in both open and closed field cages where the combined impact of the two predators on aphid population growth was significantly greater than the sum of their individual impacts.
   These results indicate that the importance of ground-foraging predators in agroecosystems may need to be reevaluated and that positive interactions between predators must be considered in models predicting the impact of multiple predator complexes.

AB We propose a class of complex population dynamic models that combines new time-varying parameters and second-order time lags for describing univariate ecological time series data. The Kalman filter and likelihood function were used to estimate parameters of all models in the class for 31 data sets, and Schwarz's information criterion (SIC) was used to select the best model for each data set. Using the SIC method, models containing density-dependent processes were selected for 23 of the 31 cases examined, while models containing complex density-dependent processes were selected in 19 of these 23 density dependence cases. The density-dependent models identified by SIC had various linear or nonlinear forms, suggesting Variable patterns of population regulation in nature. Population dynamics may combine density-dependent, inversely density-dependent, and density-independent processes, which may operate at different times and under different density ranges. These results suggest that our approach offers an advance for modeling complex population dynamics, discovering complex regulation processes, and estimating the distribution of extinction times in changing environments.

AB Progressive stabilization ("fixation") of a sand dune system by vegetational succession has allowed one anuran species (Bufo bufo) to encroach and breed in areas formerly the sole preserve of another (B. calamita). We investigated interactions and the potential for competition between larvae of these two species under conditions of community transition. Survival, growth rates, and spatial and feeding niche overlaps of larvae as well as abundance of the unicellular microorganism Prototheca richasdsi (a mediator of interference competition between tadpoles) were measured in three duplicated sets of ponds in the same habitat. One set was used by B. bufo only, one by B. calamita only, and one by both species. B. bufo larvae survived and grew as well, or better, in mixed-species ponds as they did when alone. By contrast, B. calamita larvae grew more slowly, suffered higher premetamorphic mortality, and emerged as smaller toadlets in mixed-species ponds, compared with single-species ponds. B. calamita changed its spatial niche in mixed-species ponds much more markedly than did B. bufo, but spatial and feeding niche overlaps remained high. P. richardsi was rare in guts and feces of larvae in single-species ponds, but it occurred in large numbers in guts and feces of larvae from mixed-species ponds. The data indicate that B. bufo is a superior competitor to B. calamita and that both resource and interference competition may occur between the two species in this transitional situation.

AB Despite the ubiquity of dormancy among invertebrates, the demographic ties between the active and dormant stages remain largely unexplored in most systems. Nevertheless, dormant stages could potentially have significant impacts on the ecology and evolution of the active population. In Oneida Lake, New York, populations of the suspension-feeding crustaceans Daphnia galeata mendotae and Daphnia pulicaria produce large numbers of long-lived diapausing eggs, which accumulate in the sediments to densities of over 2.5 x 10(4) eggs/m(2) for D. galeata mendotae and 8.0 x 10(4) eggs/m(2) for D. pulicaria. Sedimentation rates obtained by Pb-210 dating suggest that these eggs can remain viable for > 125 yr and that these two Daphnia populations have persisted in this system for > 200 yr. Total annual production of new diapausing eggs can range from 0 to over 10(4) new eggs/ m(2) of sediment. Annual emergence rates back to the water column are also variable but only range between 0 and 25 Daphnia/m(2). Because annual variation in the size of the overwintering water-column population ranges between 0 and 2.5 individuals/L, the contribution of emergence to the development of the spring population is considerable in some years and negligible in others. Despite similar maximum water-column densities, D. pulicaria produces and stores more eggs and has a higher rate of emergence than D. galeata mendotae, suggesting differences in the benthic-pelagic link of these two species. Diapausing eggs greatly increase the generation time of the populations that produce them and therefore have the potential to substantially alter the outcome of community interactions.

AB Seed dispersal patterns and seed persistence in the soil should strongly influence the distribution of pioneer tree recruits in gaps. Nonetheless, seed distribution patterns for pioneers are poorly known, and processes controlling the fate of seeds in the soil have been little explored. We examined patterns of seed rain, seed abundance in the soil, and seed mortality of two common pioneer trees, Miconia argentea (Melastomataceae) and Cecropia insignis (Moraceae), on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. For each species, we selected four isolated, reproductive trees within a 50-ha forest dynamics plot. Seed rain and soil seed bank samples were collected, respectively, in mesh traps and from soil cores sampled along transects radiating away from the tree crowns.
   At below-crown sites, seed rain inputs far exceeded soil seed bank densities measured at the end of the fruiting season. For Miconia, the below-crown seed bank in the surface 3 cm of soil accounted for only 23% of seed rain, and for Cecropia, only 2%. However for Miconia, at distances >5 m from the crown seed bank densities exceeded the annual seed rain input. For both species log seed densities in the seed bank declined linearly with log distance from the crown and also decreased dramatically through the year. The annual loss rate of Miconia seeds was >90% below the crown and declined to 65% at 30 m from the crown. The annual loss rate for Cecropia was >90% at all distances. Seed losses in the seed bank could be largely attributed to mortality from pathogenic fungi. Fungicide treatment significantly increased seed survival in the soil for both species.
   For these two gap-dependent pioneer species, rapid seed-bank turnover rates and logarithmic declines in soil seed density with distance from adults suggested that both the spatial distribution and timing of gap formation may have influenced their chances of successful gap colonization. Recruitment from distant seed sources, or from seeds surviving in the soil after the death of the parent tree, may be relatively rare for these species.

AB In many plant species with unisexual flowers, the female flowers lack pollinator rewards and are pollinated by visitors who mistake the female flowers for rewarding male flowers. Here we present the results of observations and experiments designed to investigate pollinator discrimination and its consequences for female reproductive success in two monoecious Begonia species pollinated by deceit. Male and female flowers of B. urophylla are similar in shape, but female flowers are smaller than male flowers, while in B. tonduzii, male and female flowers have strikingly different shapes, but their petaloid tepals are similar in total area. Flower visitors displayed marked discrimination against the rewardless female flowers of both species, Seven bee species were observed on B. urophylla, and for all species taken together the relative visitation rate to male flowers was 8.6 times that to female flowers. The bee Trigona fulviventris accounted for 95% of all visits to B. tonduzii and visited male flowers 15.4 times as often as female flowers. The flower visitors of B, urophylla varied significantly in their degree of discrimination against female flowers, with visitation rates to male flowers 3.7-21.8 times those to female flowers. The two most abundant flower visitors displayed the greatest discrimination against female flowers and, although they comprised nearly 54% of all visits, were responsible for only 15% of all visits to female flowers. Thus, the relative abundance of different flower visitors on B. urophylla is a poor predictor of pollinator importance.
   In both species the inflorescence sex ratio was male-biased early in the season and female-biased later. Hand-pollination experiments revealed that fruit set in B. tonduzii was pollinator limited both during peak and late flowering, with supplemental pollination having its greatest effect late in the season when male flowers were rare. In contrast, fruit set was only weakly affected by supplemental hand-pollination in B. urophylla. The significant pollinator limitation observed in B. tonduzii and the lack of it in B, urophylla are consistent with our observation that the visitation rate to female flowers was much higher in B. urophylla than in B. tonduzii, which was due in part to the lower level of pollinator discrimination against female flowers of B. urophylla. Our finding that female reproductive success is limited by pollinator visitation in B. tonduzii indicates an opportunity for the evolution of increased resemblance between male and female flowers in this species.

AB The effect of ectoparasitism by Macrocheles subbadius, a cosmopolitan mesostigmatid mite, on testis and somatic condition (expressed as tissue dry mass per unit body length) of its natural host Drosophila nigrospiracula was evaluated experimentally. Male flies were infested 5 h posteclosion, and the condition of their testes and soma was determined following 4 and 6 d, i.e., at the age males of this species reach sexual maturity at 25 degrees C. Mite burdens were within the range encountered in the field. Both testis and body condition were significantly reduced among infested males compared with control, uninfested males. Moreover, both measures of host condition decreased progressively with mite burden, demonstrating a dose-dependent effect of ectoparasitism. The slope of the function between ectoparasitism and testis condition was significantly steeper in males that had carried mites for 6 d as opposed to 4 d, demonstrating that the strength of the effect of ectoparasitism on testis condition depended also on the duration of infestation. A field study revealed negative relationships between mite burden and both body and testis condition, but only the relationship with body condition was statistically significant. Although thorax length (estimate of overall body length) was strongly positively correlated with dry testes and body mass, the interaction between thorax length and mite burden was not significant in regression analyses, in which either testis condition or body condition served as dependent variables. This lack of significant interaction effects indicates that larger males were not better able to buffer the physiological cost of ectoparasitism than smaller individuals. Testis volume and testis width of infested males were also found to be significantly reduced relative to uninfested individuals, suggesting that infested males produce and store fewer sperm than uninfested males, and that infestation may reduce a male's effectiveness in sperm competition.

AB Seasonal variation in reproductive success is a common phenomenon in many taxa. In birds, the costs and benefits associated with alternative breeding dates cause variation in clutch size, which is a main cause of seasonal decline in reproductive success. An immediate cause for this might be seasonal variation in the environment, or alternatively, but not mutually exclusively, date-independent differences in the parental/territory quality of early and late parents. The predictions of these hypotheses on seasonal reduction of reproductive success were tested by manipulating the hatching date and the amount of food during the nestling period of Pied Flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca). Delay in the hatching date caused lower fledging mass and lower fledging production, suggesting a causal relationship between breeding time and reproductive success. However, if delayed parents were provided with extra food, their success was the same as that of the controls. This suggests that deteriorating food supplies and/or higher energy demands for rearing the brood later in the season are important causes of the lower success of late breeders. Additionally, parental molt was affected by manipulation of both breeding date and food; delayed parents often began molting while still feeding young, but control parents generally did not. Furthermore, fledglings in the delayed group weighed less if their fathers began molting while feeding the young. This implies that parents traded off their onset of molt against the time and energy needed for their brood. These results support the view that timing-related energy constraints on breeding are important causes of seasonal decline in clutch size and reproductive success.

AB In some clones of Synchaeta pectinata, females parthenogenetically produce two types of eggs: thin-shelled, subitaneous eggs and thicker-shelled eggs that undergo a brief diapause. The stimulus for producing diapausing eggs is food limitation, either throughout the life-span or for short intervals during early adult life. Inductive food concentrations are well above the threshold food concentration (where r(m) = 0). Even when severely food limited, some females produce only subitaneous eggs, and some produce a mixture of subitaneous and diapausing eggs. Production of both types of eggs may be a risk-spreading strategy: diapausing eggs provide a refuge from short periods of very low food availability, and subitaneous eggs permit some population growth as long as food availability remains above the threshold food concentration. While prolonged food limitation reduces the birth rate, the diapause response is not always associated with, and thus probably is not directly caused by, a decreased birth rate. This supposition is consistent with the fact that the presence of a toxic cyanobacterium at high food concentrations reduces the birth rate but does not induce the diapause response. The mechanism by which food limitation is assessed by the rotifer is not known. While diapause induced by food limitation is common in microorganisms, it has rarely been reported in aquatic invertebrates.

AB Coyotes and lynx are the two most important mammalian predators of snowshoe hares throughout much of the boreal forest. Populations of hares cycle in abundance, with peaks in density occurring every 8-11 yr, and experimental results suggest that predation is a necessary factor causing these cycles. We measured the functional responses of coyotes and lynx during a cyclic fluctuation of hare populations in the southwest Yukon, to determine their effect on the cyclic dynamics. We used snow-tracking and radio telemetry to examine changes in the foraging behavior of the predators.
   Coyotes and lynx both fed mostly on hares during all winters except during cyclic lows, when the main alternative prey of coyotes was voles, and lynx switched to hunting red squirrels. Both predators showed clear functional responses to changes in the densities of hares. Kill rates of hares by coyotes varied from 0.3 to 2.3 hares/d, with the most hares killed one year before the cyclic peak, while those of lynx varied from 0.3 to 1.2 hares/d, with the highest one year after the peak. Maximum kill rates by both predators were greater than their energetic needs. The functional response of coyotes was equally well described by linear and type-2 curves, and that of lynx was well described by a type-2 curve. Kill rates by coyotes were higher during the increase in density of hares than during the cyclic decline, while the reverse was true for lynx. Coyotes killed more hares early in the winter, and cached many of these for later retrieval. Lower densities of hares were associated with longer reactive distances of both predators to hares, but with little apparent change in time spent searching or handling prey. In summary, our data show that the two similarly sized predators differed in their foraging behavior and relative abilities at capturing alternative prey, leading to different patterns in their functional responses to fluctuations in the density of their preferred prey.

AB We tested the ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation by comparing the density, population growth rate, survivorship, and recruitment of Microtus pennsylvanicus populations within a 20-ha fragmented landscape with those of populations in a 20-ha unfragmented landscape. We also tested for fragment-size effects by comparing the same measures of demographic performance across three fragment sizes (0.06, 0.25, and 1.0 ha). During 17 censuses between June 1993 and October 1994, we recorded 10 020 captures of 3946 individuals and found strong landscape differences but weak fragment-size effects. Although fragmentation reduced the habitable area by 72%, density and adult recruitment were significantly higher on the fragmented landscape relative to the control. With the exception of adult recruitment (higher on small relative to medium and large patches), no significant demographic differences existed among patches of different size. Low rates of between-population movement and differential juvenile growth rates suggested that higher recruitment rates on the fragmented landscape likely resulted from enhanced local reproduction rather than from immigration. Thus, despite the fact that populations in the fragmented landscape experienced severe habitat loss, some individuals on fragments accrued important reproductive advantages (possibly as a result of diminished social costs or enhanced food resources). That population and individual responses to fragmentation could differ so dramatically provides a novel result that illustrates the importance of using hierarchical field designs in tests of population responses to large-scale habitat alteration. We conclude that controlled, large-scale field tests can serve as an important intermediary between the inherent abstraction of simulation modeling and what is observed in the real world.

AB It has been hypothesized that flooding, interacting with light availability, can determine spatial patterns of tree regeneration by causing differential germination or survival among seedlings in river floodplains. We conducted a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA, a form of direct gradient analysis) of sapling and environmental data collected from 1980 to 1990 to investigate this hypothesis. The CCA recovered two significant axes, and of the eight environmental variables included, only elevation and percentage sky explained significant portions of the variability in species location. Axis 1 was correlated with elevation, while Axis 2 was correlated with percentage sky. Comparison of first axis rankings with species flood tolerance rankings obtained from the literature showed substantial agreement, indicating that elevation was a surrogate for flood tolerance. Comparison of second axis rankings with species shade tolerance rankings obtained from the literature showed little correspondence between position on the light gradient and species shade tolerance rankings; several of the most shade-tolerant species were placed on the high-light end of the light gradient. These results suggest that sapling distributions are responding primarily to flooding and light. The failure of the species to assort along the light gradient in accordance with their shade tolerance suggests that flooding interacts with life history traits of individual species, especially shade tolerance, resulting in complex species-specific responses. When we attempt to tease apart the interaction between light and flooding, we find two components: flood tolerance may allow persistence of some species under lower light conditions than normal, and flood intolerance may limit some normally shade-tolerant species to high-light conditions, where growth is fast enough to allow escape from the flooding hazard.

AB Whole-stream size gradients of drift-feeding stream salmonids have received practically no attention, perhaps because the smaller-fish-upstream pattern that is thought to prevail is consistent with knowledge of habitat selection by other stream fish at the local scale. However, a rather counterintuitive larger-fish-upstream pattern has recently been documented for Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) in Alaska and brown trout (Salmo trutta) in New Zealand, and habitat selection theory cannot explain these observations. My goal in this paper is to improve this situation by developing a model that predicts the distribution of a population of fish both within single pools and over the length of the entire river, as well as the behavioral mechanism responsible. The model uses information on invertebrate drift density and water temperature to predict the growth rate of different sizes of fish at the positions available in the stream. Fish then distribute themselves so that each individual occupies the most profitable position it call defend, with the largest fish winning any disputes. The model suggests that streams can be classified into categories based on the way temperature and drift density vary with the passage downstream. Each of these categories favors a different combination of size gradient and behavioral mechanism. A larger-fish-upstream pattern due to size-dependent habitat preference is predicted for streams with cool temperatures and low drift densities, conditions found in Arctic grayling streams. A larger-fish-upstream pattern due to competition between fish of different size is predicted in warm streams, irrespective of drift density, conditions found in many New Zealand trout streams. A smaller-fish-upstream pattern due to competition between fish of different size is expected in cool streams with high drift abundance; currently no data are available to test this prediction.

AB Empirical evidence to assess the hypothesis that nest predation pressure influences avian assemblage composition is mostly lacking. We examined distribution of predation risk for artificial bird nests in the understory of coniferous and deciduous forests in southeastern Alaska and adjacent western Canada to determine whether habitat-specific nest predation pressure could be a factor influencing habitat selection and, in turn, breeding bird diversity. Two sizes of open-cup nests were constructed of natural materials and placed in nest sites representative of those used by local breeding bird species although, on average, artificial nests were more conspicuous than natural nests monitored in a companion study. Artificial nests were exposed to predation during early and late nesting seasons in 1993 and 1994. Principal nest predators identified using automated cameras were red squirrel (Tamiasciurus huclsonicus), Steller's Jay (Cyanocitta stelleri; Alaska only), Gray Jay (Perisoreus canadensis; Canada only), and small mammals. Systematic point-count censuses recorded significantly more red squirrels than jays in coniferous forest, and both jay species reached peak abundances at the border between coniferous and deciduous forest, relative to interior forest of both types. In repeated-measures analysis of variance, predation of artificial nests was significantly higher in coniferous than deciduous forest, and greater for large (thrush size) than for small (warbler size) nests. Nest height (shrub vs. ground) was not an important factor, due to a significant interaction with time (early vs, late nesting season). Natural and artificial nest predation losses were comparable in deciduous forest, but artificial nests were more susceptible than natural nests in coniferous forest understory. Artificial nest losses reflected the distribution of predators, especially red squirrels, and was negatively associated with breeding bird diversity in northwestern forest understory-confirming that nest predation pressure is one (of several) plausible determinants of avian habitat selection and assemblage organization.

AB We compared relative use of streamwater dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by bacteria and the trophic significance of bacteria to invertebrates in two headwater streams at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in North Carolina: a stream with all leaf litter inputs excluded for 1 yr, and a reference stream. Leaf litter standing crop in the treatment stream was <1% that of the reference stream, and fine benthic organic matter (FBOM) was 50% lower than the reference. We used a whole-stream tracer addition of C-13-1 sodium acetate for 3 wk to label bacteria and hence their consumers during both July and December. Bacterial delta(13)C was measured by collecting respired bacterial carbon. We estimated the contribution of bacterial carbon to consumers using a mixing model for invertebrates and bacteria. The acetate label declined exponentially downstream with a 10-m uptake length in each stream and season. FBOM and biofilm were the only detrital samples to show a strong label; both were more labeled in the litter-excluded stream. Bacteria in the litter-excluded stream had 7-10 times more label than those in the reference stream during both seasons, showing their higher relative use of streamwater DOC. The percentage of invertebrate carbon derived from bacteria was >20% for many taxa. This was significantly related to the percentage of amorphous detritus in invertebrate guts, suggesting that bacterial carbon supporting higher trophic levels was associated with amorphous detrital particles. Predatory invertebrates were labeled, showing that bacterial carbon was important for higher trophic levels. Some invertebrates were more highly labeled than the bacteria. Stenonema in the treatment stream contained eight times more label than measured bacteria. This suggests that they were using an unmeasured bacterial source such as bacteria in exposed epilithic biofilms, which had higher delta(13)C than all other detrital components. Invertebrates in the treatment stream did not appear to use more bacterial carbon than in the reference stream despite a lower standing crop of detritus. Tallaperla, a shredding stonefly, derived 20-40% of its carbon from bacteria in both streams, even though it was more labeled in the treatment stream. Our estimates of the percentage of invertebrate carbon derived from bacteria were higher than those found in laboratory-based studies. To investigate reasons for this difference, we examined the possibility that bacterial carbon was principally found in exopolymers, as our labeling method would have labeled exopolymers. We found 6 g/m(2) of colloidal carbohydrates in the reference stream, which was five times greater than bacterial biomass; thus the high use of bacterial carbon by invertebrates may be a consequence of the availability of these polymers.

AB We investigated whether seedling establishment in two alpine plants in Colorado was enhanced through maternally mediated nurse effects. To benefit from an association with maternal debris, seeds must remain with the debris, resulting in reduced risks to seedlings and enhancement of establishment success. Seedlings of Frasera speciosa (Gentianaceae) and Cirsium scopulorum (Asteraceae) were disproportionately abundant under decaying adult rosettes and infructescences relative to other microsites equidistant from the parent. Beneath decaying infructescences of both species, soil was significantly moister, and evaporation rates from hydrometers that mimicked young seedlings were significantly lower than in exposed (control) microsites. For F. speciosa, mean water potential of seedlings planted under infructescences was also significantly higher than that of seedlings planted into exposed plots. These data suggest that drought stress is reduced for seedlings associated with adult debris. In two populations of F. speciosa, adult cover had significant positive effects on seedling establishment in 1995. These advantages were mediated through enhanced survival of young seedlings, rather than emergence success. Cover enhanced seedling survival by 80% in one population and 145% in the other. In one population of C. scopulorum, no seedlings were established from seeds planted with or without debris in 1994 (an extremely dry year). However, in 1995 (a wetter year), seedlings were seven times more likely to emerge and about four times more likely to survive in association with debris than in exposed plots. These results show that associations with adult debris enhance offspring establishment success in both plant species, and provide one of the first demonstrations of conspecific nursing, a form of parental care, in plants.

AB Understanding of the selective effects of insect herbivory on plants comes primarily from studies of herbivory aboveground. The impact of belowground herbivory, either in isolation or in concert with herbivory aboveground, on plant fitness is only beginning to be understood.
   I reduced the densities of root-boring ghost moth (Hepialus californicus) larvae and/or flower-and seed-feeding insects of bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus), a woody shrub, and followed fecundity and survival of plants for three years. In year one, suppression of aboveground herbivores increased mean seed output by 31%, but suppression of below-ground herbivores had no significant effect on plant fecundity. In year two, suppression of aboveground herbivores increased mean seed production by 123%, and belowground herbivores again had no significant effect on plant fecundity. In year three, suppression of aboveground herbivores had little effect on lupine fecundity; plants protected from root borers, however, produced, on average, 85% more pods and 83% more seeds compared with unprotected plants. In each of the three years, there was no statistical interaction between herbivory above-and belowground; effects of individual herbivores on plant fitness were additive.
   Both modes of herbivory had significant cumulative effects on lupine fitness. Protection from chronic aboveground herbivory increased mean cumulative seed output over 3 yr by 78%; suppression of belowground herbivores increased mean cumulative seed production by 31%. Cumulative average mortality across all three years was 18% greater for plants exposed to root herbivory than for plants protected from root herbivory. Taken together, results show that both above-and belowground herbivores can potentially impose strong selection on bush lupine.

AB An important parameter in the evolution of sexual polymorphisms in hermaphroditic organisms is the way resources are allocated to male and female functions by various morphs. Detecting differences in allocation between morphs may not always be possible under optimal conditions and may require stressful conditions. Here we investigate the allocation to various functions in the hermaphroditic, highly selfing, freshwater snail Bulinus truncatus, in relation to phally polymorphism. In natural populations, two morphs, euphallic individuals (regular hermaphrodites) and aphallic individuals (missing the male copulatory organ), co-occur at various ratios. To quantify whether the loss of the male organ in aphallics may be compensated for by other functions, we compared the fecundity, size, and survival of 123 aphallic and 111 euphallic snails originating from 53 families and three natural populations under optimal (25 degrees C) and stressful (19 degrees C and 30 degrees C) temperatures. We also compared the hatching rate and survival of offspring of 10 aphallic and 10 euphallic snails per population at these three temperatures. Firstly, we confirmed a strong effect of temperature on the determination of the sexual morph. Secondly, we found that the two morphs did not differ in size, fecundity, hatching rate, or survival of offspring suggesting no obvious cost of the male function in isolated snails, even under stressful conditions. However, a trade-off was observed: aphallic individuals laid more capsules, though with fewer eggs per capsule, than euphallic individuals. Thirdly, we found a linear variation of some parameters with the family aphally ratio, suggesting that fitness may be perceived in a frequency-dependent way. Our results are discussed with regard to the relative strength of selective and stochastic factors in the evolution of phally polymorphism.

AB In this study, flood frequency, productivity, and spatial heterogeneity were correlated with plant species richness (SX) among wetlands on a coastal island in southeast Alaska. Studies of 16 sites in or near the Kadashan River basin demonstrated nonlinear, unimodal relations between flood frequency and SR, productivity and SR, and linear relations between SR and the spatial variation of flood frequencies (SVFF) within a site. SVFF is caused by microtopographic variation in elevation. A nonlinear regression model relating SR to flood frequency and SVFF explained much of the variation in SR between wetland communities. Sites with intermediate flood frequencies and high SVFF were species-rich, while sites frequently, rarely, or permanently flooded and with low SVFF were species-poor. The data suggest that small-scale spatial variation can dramatically alter the impact of disturbances.
   The data also support Michael Huston's dynamic-equilibrium model of species diversity, which predicts the effects of productivity and disturbance on diversity patterns. Species-rich sites had low to intermediate levels of productivity and intermediate flood frequencies, and species-poor sites had very low or high flood frequencies and low productivity, supporting the model's predictions. The model was tested at contrasting spatial scales (1000 m(2) and 1 m(2)). At the 1000-m(2)? scale, Huston's model predicted 78% of the variation in SR. At the microplot scale, relationships between SR and flood frequency were weaker, and the dynamic-equilibrium model predicted only 36%; of the variation in SR.

AB Timing of mortality was studied in Willow Tits (Parus montanus) during three winters, 1991-1993 and 1995-1996, near Oulu, northern Finland. The aim of this study was, by investigating monthly winter survival rates, to examine (1) whether late winter is the most difficult time for birds, and (2) whether temperature, especially in late winter, correlates with survival, as previously proposed. We also sought information on sex and age differences in timing of mortality,rarely studied among passerines. After color-marking, individuals were resighted monthly from September to May. Capture-recapture models were applied to separately estimate survival and resighting probabilities. Survival estimates given by three methods of varying complexity (simple counts, Jolly-Seber, Cormack-Jolly-Seber) were compared. The three different-methods yielded similar survival estimates. Because simple counting does not account for emigration, consistent results from different analyses support the earlier view that Willow Tits are sedentary. Adults survived better than yearlings in all winters and exhibited more constant survival rates. Two-year data also suggest that winter and summer survival rates were similar in adults, but not in yearlings, for which mortality was greatest in winter. Males survived better than females in one winter. Temperature per se did not correlate with survival, but deviations to colder than long-term average temperature seemed to be associated with low survival probability, which could reflect occasional food limitation. A feeding experiment. was conducted to test the winter food limitation hypothesis. Fed birds survived winter better than did control birds, significantly so in yearlings and males, but not in adults or females. previously, late winter has been suggested as being a difficult time for birds. However, no support was found for this hypothesis. Small passerines wintering at high latitudes seem to be able to cope with high energy demand and the limited foraging time of winter.

AB Fragmentation of breeding habitat may cause declines in many bird populations. Our perception of the demographic effects of habitat fragmentation comes primarily from studies in the midwestern and eastern United States and Scandinavia. We know very little about the demographic effects of anthropogenically caused habitat fragmentation in habitats prone to natural disturbance, as is typical of most forest types in the western United States. We located and monitored 1916 nests on eight sites located in mostly forested landscapes and eight sites located in primarily agricultural landscapes to study the effects of landscape-level fragmentation on nest predation and brood parasitism in riparian areas in western Montana.
   Patterns of nest predation were opposite those documented from more eastern locales; predation rates were higher in forested landscapes than in fragmented landscapes dominated by agriculture. This pattern probably reflects the importance of forest predators in these landscapes: red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) were much more abundant in forested landscapes and declined quickly with decreasing forest cover, whereas predators that typically increase in fragmented landscapes in the Midwest (such as corvids) increased only at very high levels of fragmentation. Patch size and distance to habitat edge did not influence predation rates. Brood parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) decreased with increasing forest cover, but the strongest predictors of parasitism were the abundance of human development (farms and houses) on the landscape and the density of cowbird host species, not forest cover. The combined effects of predation and parasitism resulted in low nesting productivity in both forested and agricultural landscapes for heavily parasitized species, while the species not affected by cowbird parasitism had greater nesting productivity in fragmented agricultural landscapes. Our results suggest that the effects of fragmentation are dependent on the habitat structure, the landscape context, the predator community, and the impact of parasitism. All of these factors may differ substantially in western ecosystems when compared to previously studied forests, making generalizations about the effect of fragmentation difficult.

AB The California chaparral community has a rich flora of species with different mechanisms for cuing germination to postfire conditions. Heat shock triggers germination of certain species but has no stimulatory effect on a great many other postfire species that are chemically stimulated by combustion products. Previous reports have shown that charred wood will induce germination, and here we report that smoke also induces germination in these same species. Smoke is highly effective, often inducing 100% germination in deeply dormant seed populations with 0% control germination. Smoke induces germination both directly and indirectly by aqueous or gaseous transfer from soil to seeds. Neither nitrate nor ammonium ions were effective in stimulating germination of smoke-stimulated species, nor were most of the quantitatively important gases generated by biomass smoke. Nitrogen dioxide, however, was very effective at inducing germination in Caulanthus heterophyllus (Brassicaceae), Emmenanthe penduliflora (Hydrophyllaceae), Phacelia grandiflora (Hydrophyllaceae), and Silene multinervia (Caryophyllaceae). Three species, Dendromecon rigida (Papaveraceae), Dicentra chrysantha, and Trichostema lanatum (Lamiaceae), failed to germinate unless smoke treatment was coupled with prior treatment of 1 yr soil storage.
   Smoke-stimulated germination was found in 25 chaparral species, representing 11 families, none of which were families known for heat-shock-stimulated germination. Seeds of smoke-stimulated species have many analogous characteristics that separate them from most heat-shock-stimulated seeds, including: (1) outer seed coats that are highly textured, (2) a poorly developed outer cuticle, (3) absence of a dense palisade tissue in the seed coat, and (4) a subdermal membrane that is semipermeable, allowing water passage but blocking entry of large (molecular mass > 500) solutes. Tentative evidence suggests that permeability characteristics of this subdermal layer are altered by smoke. While the mechanism behind smoke-induced germination is not known, it appears that smoke may be involved in overcoming different blocks to germination in different species. For example, in Emmenanthe penduliflora, NO, in smoke was sufficient to induce germination, and most forms of physical or chemical scarification also induced germination. For Romneya coulteri, NO, alone failed to induce germination, and scarified seeds required addition of gibberellic acid. In Dicentra chrysantha, none of these treatments, nor smoke alone, induced,germination, but germination was triggered by a combination of soil burial followed by smoke treatment. Smoke-stimulated species differed substantially in the duration of smoke exposure required to induce germination, and this was inversely correlated with tolerance to smoke exposure. We suggest that such differences in response may affect postfire community structure.

We hypothesized that the species composition of AMF communities could have the potential to determine plant community structure if the growth response to different AMF species or to communities of AMF species varies among plant species. To test the existence of such a differential response we conducted a pot experiment where each of three plant species, Hieracium pilosella, Bromus erectus, and Festuca ovina were inoculated with each of four AMF species, or with a mixture of these four AMF species, or were uninoculated. The AMF species originated from a calcareous grassland in which the three plant species also coexisted.
   We obtained three pieces of evidence suggesting that AMF have the potential to determine plant community structure. First, plant species differed in their dependency on AMF, thus varying in degree of benefit received. Second, specific AMF species and a mixture of these AMF species had significantly different effects on several plant growth variables, and these effects were not the same on each plant species. Third, the amount of variation in the growth response of a plant species to four AMF species and to the mixture of AMF species differed among the plant species. Hieracium differed greatly in its growth response to several AMF species while Bromus did not exhibit much variation in its response to different AMF species.
   The varying mycorrhizal dependency of different plant species has previously been proposed as a mechanism determining plant community structure. However, we found that the mycorrhizal dependency of a plant species can vary greatly because of differential growth responses to specific AMF species compared to the growth of the uninoculated plants. Consequently mycorrhizal dependency, as a measure indicating how much a plant depends on AMF for its growth, is not necessarily a fixed value and therefore cannot be used as a definitive term. In addition, those plant species with highly variable responses to single AMF species or to combinations of AMF species (AMF communities) will be strongly affected by the specific species of AMF that occupy their roots, in contrast to plant species that do not respond differently to different AMF species. We conclude that, through their differential effects on plant growth, AMF species that co-occur as natural AMF communities have the potential to determine plant community structure, and that future studies on plant population and community structure need to consider the strength of their role as a determinant.

AB We used molecular techniques to examine the ectomycorrhizal fungal community associated with pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) growing in two soil types in a semiarid region of northern Arizona: cinder soils low in nutrients and moisture, and sandy-loam soils with higher moisture and nutrient levels. Pinyon performance (e.g., growth, reproduction, water stress) has been shown to be markedly lower in cinder than in sandy-loam environments. Fungal community composition and richness were determined using RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) analysis of ectomycorrhizal root tips collected from three sites within each soil type.
   Several patterns emerged from these analyses. First, communities in both cinder and sandy-loam soils were dominated by one or a few abundant ectomycorrhizal types, a species abundance pattern common to many plant and animal communities. Second, unlike the pattern for many other organisms, ectomycorrhizal fungal type (species) richness was not correlated with measures of ecosystem productivity such as soil nutrient and moisture levels; cinder and sandy-loam soils had similar numbers of ectomycorrhizal fungal types (range of 15-19 fungal types for both soil types). Third, soil type and fungal community composition were linked, as cluster analysis demonstrated greater similarity of fungal communities from sites within soil types than between them. Differential amplification using primers with enhanced specificity for basidiomycetes indicated that an average of 85% of the ectomycorrhiza found at the sandy-loam sites were members of the subphylum Basidiomycotina, whereas over half (mean = 52%) of the ectomycorrhiza at the cinder sites were formed by members of other fungal groups, probably the subphylum Ascomycotina. Fourth, a preliminary survey of 14-45 ectomycorrhizal root tips from each of 20 trees at one cinder site indicated that trees were dominated by one or a few ectomycorrhizal RFLP types. However, the same RFLP types did not dominate on all trees, and dominant types showed considerable spatial variation. Fifth, the RFLP patterns of some fungal sporocarps matched those of ectomycorrhizal root tips, but many did not, indicating that many of the ectomycorrhizal fungi at these sites fruit infrequently, whereas other fungi with more abundant sporocarps may not form ectomycorrhiza. This emphasizes the need to characterize the ectomycorrhizal communities formed on the plant roots themselves, rather than characterization based on sporocarps alone, particularly in arid environments. Finally, the differences in ectomycorrhizal fungal communities we observed between soil types supported the concept that conserving fungal diversity requires conservation of host plant species over their entire range, not just typical sites. If future studies corroborate these patterns, our results suggest that abiotically stressful environments are important to include in these conservation efforts.

AB We investigated determinants of territory size in White-winged Trumpeters (Psophia leucoptera), frugivorous, cooperatively breeding birds that defend large, permanent, all-purpose territories in lowland Amazonian rain forest. During a 7-mo period, we measured changes in food density at a site in Manu National Park, Peru, and conducted full-day focal samples on individuals that allowed us to record daily food intake of territorial birds. We used data from laboratory analyses on energy content of fruit species eaten by trumpeters to calculate a phenology of energy content for food available on territories of focal groups, and to calculate daily energy intake of focal trumpeters. Additionally, we used lab measurements of basal metabolic rate of trumpeters to estimate daily energy requirements of wild trumpeters.
   Both census and focal sample data suggested that food availability on trumpeter territories varied widely, sometimes greatly exceeding and sometimes falling short of the amount that we calculated was necessary to meet average daily energy requirements of groups. To determine whether trumpeter territory size was related to food density, we conducted fruit removals. Every day, we removed an amount of fruit from the territory that was equivalent to the amount of fruit ingested daily by the focal group during a control period preceding the removal experiment. We conducted removal experiments during periods when food density on territories appeared to be abundant and also when food abundance appeared to be low. Trumpeter food consumption did not change when fruit was removed during periods of resource abundance; however, when experimental removals were conducted during periods of food scarcity, the total energy value of food consumed decreased significantly. These results suggest that food abundance on trumpeter territories sometimes exceeds and sometimes is close to or below the amount needed to meet energy needs of the groups. Based on our data, we propose that territory size of White-winged Trumpeter groups reflects some minimum size needed to provide the group with a baseline level of food intake during seasonal periods of decreased food abundance.

AB Scottish Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus matus) showed unstable population dynamics, with density-dependent features differing between areas on rich and poor soils. The study was conducted on arctic-alpine land on four submassifs, three of nutrient-poor granite and one of richer schist. Ptarmigan numbers cycled with a period usually of similar to 10 yr, but sometimes 6 yr. Delayed density dependence was detected in populations on granite submassifs, but not on schist, despite significant cyclicity there. Spring densities and the number of young reared per broad were higher on schist than on granite. Population change from one spring to the next was related to intervening breeding success on both granite and schist, but to summer loss only on granite. The same factors that determined variations in clutch size among years also largely affected breeding success. Population change, breeding success, summer loss, and clutch size showed delayed density dependence on granite, but not on schist, where numbers fluctuated more erratically. On granite, but not schist, early plant growth was followed by larger clutches, breeding success was related to June air temperature, and June temperature tended to peak 1-2 yr before ptarmigan peaks. Cyclic June temperature may have entrained the timing of ptarmigan cycles on granite. Results on both schist and granite were inconsistent with expectations from predator-prey hypotheses for cycles. In years of rising numbers, hens laid more eggs and reared more chicks per extra egg laid than in years of decline, and the proportion of surviving young recruited into the spring population was probably greater. Our hypothesis is that Scottish Rock Ptarmigan show unstable dynamics, driven by intrinsic positive feedback between recruitment in one year and the next, regulated by negative feedback between recruitment and density, and modified by the physical factors of weather and soil fertility that affect female nutrition and breeding success.

AB Intraguild predation (IGP), a common interaction in invertebrates and vertebrates, affects the abundance and distribution of many species. Several parameters influence the magnitude and direction of IGP: feeding specificity, size, mobility, and aggressiveness of the protagonists, as well as extraguild prey density. Under laboratory conditions, we studied IGP among three species of aphid predators, Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), Chrysoperla rufilabris (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), and Coleomegilla maculata lengi (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), which commonly attack the potato aphid (extraguild prey) Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Homoptera: Aphididae). We characterized the levels and symmetry of IGP among the various stages of the predators in the absence of extraguild prey. The aphid specialist A. aphidimyza was more vulnerable to IGP than C. rufilabris and C. maculata, two generalist predators. The C. maculata/A. rufilabris interaction was symmetric (mutual IGP), whereas the C. maculata/A. aphidimyza and C. rufilabris/A. aphidimyza interactions were asymmetric, in favor of the coccinellid and the lacewing, respectively. Sessile and low mobility stages of all species were extremely vulnerable to IGP. Generally, the larger sized individual won confrontations. For similar sizes, lacewing larvae were superior to coccinellid larvae.
   We also tested whether IGP decreases when extraguild prey are introduced into the system. Data from five predator combinations revealed three types of responses: (1) an exponential decrease in IGP (lacewing instar I vs. coccinellid instar I); (2) a constant IGP (lacewing instar III vs. coccinellid instar I); (3) a constant IGP at low densities decreasing at high densities (lacewing instar III vs. gall midge old larva). Four theoretical scenarios are derived from these responses. Each is discussed according to the ecological attributes of the protagonists. This study shows that IGP is influenced by factors inherent to the predators and external factors such as extraguild prey density. The results are discussed further in the context of aphid biological control.

AB The effect of parasites on host community structure and biodiversity is an important issue of community ecology. Both verbal and mathematical models suggest that host species with higher fitness costs associated with parasitism should bear a competitive disadvantage in the presence of parasites. However, few rigorous empirical tests exist. This study examined the effects of a tapeworm parasite (Hymenolepis diminuta) on competition between two flour beetle species (Tribolium confusum and T. castaneum). The flour beetles are the intermediate host of this rat tapeworm parasite. Previous studies demonstrated that T. castaneum is usually the superior competitor in competition with T. confusum in parasite-free environments. However, because T. castaneum is more susceptible to parasitism and shows higher fitness costs when infected than T. confusum, we expected that T. castaneum would bear a competitive disadvantage in the presence of the parasite. In contrast, we found that tapeworm infection significantly increased the likelihood of T. castaneum winning the competition, reduced the time needed for T. castaneum to win, and increased T. castaneum population density compared to parasite-free populations. Therefore, our results suggest that the tapeworm infection confers some advantage to T. castaneum and are in contrast to the expectation based on mathematical studies and verbal arguments. Disagreements between experimental results and the hypothesized predictions probably reflect the effect of parasite-induced changes in intraguild predation. Our results suggest that theories on parasite effects of competition need to consider the complex nature of host-parasite associations, including the effect of parasites on host behaviors.

AB To investigate how plant diversity affects ecosystem-level processes such as primary production and nutrient cycling, I established an experimental plant diversity gradient in serpentine grassland using four functional groups of plants: early season annual forbs (E), late season annual forbs (L), perennial bunchgrasses (P), and nitrogen fixers (N). These groups differ in growth form, phenology, and other traits relevant to nutrient cycling (e.g., rooting depth, litter C:N ratio). Two or three species of each type were planted in single-group treatments, and in two-, three-, and four-way combinations, giving a range of richness from zero to nine species. I tested the hypothesis that, because of complementary resource use, increasing functional group diversity will lead to higher net primary production. At the scale of this experiment (alpha-diversity and yearly production), more diverse treatments were not necessarily the most productive. Live plant biomass varied more within than among levels of diversity. In most two-, three-, and four-way mixtures of functional groups, overall productivity did not differ significantly from the average of the yields of component one-group treatments. This pattern apparently resulted from competition: early season annuals and late season annuals reduced the biomass of perennial bunchgrasses (the most productive group in monoculture) below levels expected from monoculture yields.
   Relative Yield Totals (RYT) indicated complementary resource use in the EL and LP two-way and ELPN four-way mixtures. In the EL mixture, complementarity appeared to result from temporal rather than spatial partitioning of resources. Because of shifts in root:shoot ratio in mixtures, however, only the LP treatment had consistently significant RYT >1 when assessing total (roots plus shoots) productivity and nitrogen yield. These results show that (1) composition (the identity of the species present) can be at least as important as richness (the number of species present) in effects on ecosystem processes; (2) competition during critical parts of the growing season may prevent absolute increases in net primary production with increasing diversity, despite complementary resource use at other times of the year; and (3) shifts in belowground allocation in species mixtures can have significant effects on estimates of productivity and resource use as species diversity changes.

AB We experimentally tested whether two similarly sized generalist predators found in different habitats had similar effects on prey community patterns. Notophthalmus viridescens (the red-spotted newt) occurs primarily in temporary ponds, while Enneacanthus obesus (the banded sunfish) is restricted to permanent ponds. Larval anurans are an important prey assemblage found in both kinds of ponds. We stocked both predators in artificial ponds together with six species of larval anurans, forming different species assemblages, to assess whether a similar abundance and biomass of each predator would have comparable impacts on community patterns. The predators differed in their effects on prey species composition but had similar impacts on composite community attributes, including prey species diversity and total prey biomass. Enneacanthus eliminated Pseudacris crucifer, Hyla andersonii, Hyla versicolor, and Scaphiopus holbrookii, creating a community dominated by Bufo woodhousii and Rana sphenocephala. Notophthalmus eliminated Bufo, creating an assemblage dominated by Pseudacris but also containing four additional species. Very few anurans survived in ponds containing both newts and fish. The different consequences of predation by newts and fish reflect different effectiveness of anuran antipredator defenses against these predators. Mechanisms that reduced predation by fish, such as unpalatability, were ineffective against newts. Our findings suggest that a patchy distribution of functionally distinct predators across a landscape of discrete habitats will contribute to predictable patterns of spatial variation in community composition and will create a mosaic of communities dominated by different prey species.

AB We analyzed 43 yr of live-trapping data for eight species of small mammals in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario. Our primary objective was to test whether complex nonlinear models are necessary to describe dynamics of the Algonquin rodent populations. Variation in abundance among species was related to mean abundance by a simple power function with an exponent of 1.77, implying that population variability did not increase with mean density as much as one might expect for strictly statistical reasons. Time-series analyses of annual population densities indicated no significant autocorrelation functions for five species. Southern red-backed voles, red squirrels, and flying squirrels had significant autocorrelations, but only flying squirrels had an autocorrelation function suggestive of cyclic population dynamics. Per capita rates of population growth were density-dependent in all eight species, although in most cases there was substantial deviation around the fitted regression lines. Response surface models with one- and two-year lags significantly improved the statistical fit to data for three species, but only one of these response surface models was sustainable in the face of realistic stochastic variation in per capita growth. These results suggest that simple logistic models are adequate for predicting the long-term dynamics of the Algonquin small-mammal assemblage. All eight species showed evidence of synchronized population fluctuations over time, suggesting trophic linkages due to shared food resources, shared predators, or both.

AB The saguaro population in a 700-ha area at the Desert Laboratory on Tumamoc Hill, Tucson, Arizona, was censused in 1908, one year after livestock were excluded. In 1964, four IO-ha plots were established within the original area to determine the effect of slope aspect on plant growth and demography. The plots were recensused in 1970 and 1993. We developed a model for determining saguaro age,using the growth rates of over 3000 plants from 1964 to 1970. The model was verified with 1993 data. Changes in population size and the estimated age structures were then used to infer regeneration trends.
   Saguaro populations on all slope aspects nearly doubled since 1908. Yet, during the same period, relative abundances of saguaros remained higher on the south and east aspects than on the north and west aspects. Higher recruitment and survival of young plants rather than mortality of older ones are largely responsible for the differences between aspects.
   The estimated age structures show large, multi-decadal fluctuations in saguaro regeneration. Prior to 1908, populations on all slopes experienced an extended period of decline beginning around the late 1860s. The recent surge in recruitment began in the 1920s and peaked in the 1970s. Populations currently are again in decline. Better regeneration generally corresponds with relatively wet conditions, and poorer regeneration with drier conditions. However, extended periods of decline often included episodes of relatively wet conditions (e.g., from the 1860s to the 1920s), indicating that other climatic and biotic factors also determine recruitment success. Establishment may have been suppressed by colder winters, livestock grazing, and rock quarrying.
   This long-term study demonstrates that, despite low regeneration and population decline during much of the last two centuries, saguaros have persisted on Tumamoc Hill because of episodic surges in seedling establishment.

AB The relationship between species richness and biomass is and has been one of the most controversial subjects in ecology. This paper examines these relationships from the perspectives of habitat heterogeneity and environmental gradients measured within and cross five microhabitat types. Species richness, aboveground biomass, and their relationships were compared in two ways: with samples aggregated by microhabitat type, and with analysis of all microhabitat types. Within microhabitat types, in which the environment was relatively homogeneous, we found the species richness-biomass relationship to be positive, negative, or non-existent. The relationship is positive when biomass is low tin open and half-shrub microhabitats) and negative when it exceeds a certain level(e.g., under shrubs). When the sample area encompassed different microhabitat types, a "hump-shaped" relationship was detected. The mechanisms underlying these observed patterns are discussed from the perspectives of environmental gradients and competition.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB In many vertebrates, males are apparently more affected by adverse environmental conditions, particularly during early stages of development, than are females. Three explanations have been proposed for this pattern. First, sexual size dimorphism (SSD) may result in sexes having different nutritional requirements to achieve the same viability, and males are more commonly the larger sex. Second, reduced performance of males could result from possession of an unguarded sex chromosome combined with environmental dependence in expression of deleterious recessives. Third, the observed difference may be a consequence of possession of a male phenotype, for example, due to higher circulating levels of androgens associated with development of male reproductive organs acting antagonistically on other systems. We used experimental manipulations of rearing conditions, coupled with a molecular genetic technique for gender identification, to test these hypotheses in a population of Collared Flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis, a migrant, hole-nesting pas serine bird. Nestlings of that species exhibit sexual size monomorphism, and as with other birds, females are heterogametic. As a consequence, the three hypotheses make different predictions about the way in which gender and the environment will interact. Comparisons of brothers and sisters in a split-brood, partial cross-fostering design revealed no evidence of gender X environment interaction on body size, wing length, body mass, or recruitment to the breeding population in this size monomorphic species. Our results therefore support the first hypothesis, namely, that sex differences in performance in sexually dimorphic species are most likely to be caused by different nutritional requirements. Our experiments allow us to investigate the existence of sex-specific fitness differences across an environmental gradient; such data are important for generating and testing hypotheses relating to adaptive sex allocation. The absence of gender X environment interactions demonstrated here supports recent studies of this species indicating a lack of sex ratio adjustment in response to a related, natural, environmental gradient. The possibility of gender X environment interactions along environmental gradients other than those investigated here should be addressed experimentally.

AB We tested the hypothesis that blood-feeding mites adversely affect House Wren (Troglodytes aedon) reproductive success. We measured the effects of natural mite numbers on nestling mass, nestling survival, and length of the nestling period during the summers of 1990 and 1992, and used path analysis to examine the effects of unmanipulated mite numbers on nestling health. We also investigated whether an experimental reduction in mite numbers affected nestling mass, length of the nestling period, and subsequent reproductive success of female House Wrens.
   Among unmanipulated nests, mite load had no discernible effect on the mass and survival of nestling House Wrens or on length of the nestling period. Similarly, broods with experimentally reduced numbers of mites did not differ significantly from unmanipulated broods in nestling mass, survival, or length of the nestling period. We also detected no effect of experimentally reduced mite numbers on subsequent reproductive success of female House Wrens.
   Transmission rate and virulence in parasites are often positively correlated, and mite transmission rate at the study site is high. Virulence, however, is usually low. We propose that removal of old nests from nesting cavities by male House Wrens and unfavorable microclimatic conditions in the nest combine to reduce the initial size of mite populations. This usually slows the mite population growth sufficiently to permit nestlings to leave the nest before mites reach levels that produce detrimental effects.

AB Current methods for evaluating habitat selection from animal space-use observations ignore possible interactions between time allocation patterns relative to different resources, their relative abundance, and their spatial arrangements. Habitat selection may occur in situations in which animals experience a trade-off, e.g., between time used foraging in areas with abundant forage but poor protective cover, and time used for resting in areas with good protective cover but low forage abundance. We show how functional responses in habitat use (i.e., change in preference with availability of one of two main habitat types) may be tested. Given radio-telemetry data for a sample of individuals, binomial legit models can be used to regress proportionate use of a habitat type p((u)) against the proportion of that habitat available, p((a)),. Given an appropriate fit to the data by a linear predictor on a legit scale, functional response will be indicated by a estimated slope parameter not equal 1, while a slope = 0 will indicate a consistent use as availability changes. Habitat preference is inferred from the legit regression parameters when the fitted value of the proportion of use at a specified proportion of availability, is significantly greater than the proportional availability.

AB Canopy gaps are a fairly well-studied phenomenon in tropical forests, but less well known are their belowground effects on patterns of root length and biomass and the consequences of such changes on regeneration and community structure. I examined canopy gaps and adjacent understory sites on two soil types of contrasting fertility in a lowland rain forest in Costa Rica to determine (1) whether canopy gaps create root gaps beneath the canopy opening, and (2) whether the effects of such root gaps on root ingrowth rates, root competition, and root responses to nutrient heterogeneity are related to soil type. Based on soil coring, canopy gaps had less fine (<2 mm) root length and biomass than comparable closed canopy sites. Reductions in root length and biomass were greater on the infertile (residual) soil type than the fertile (alluvial) type but were unrelated to gap size, age, or percentage canopy openness. Additionally, I measured root competition in a trenching experiment using the pioneer tree Hampea appendiculata as a bioassay species. Light appeared to be the only factor limiting relative growth rate, as seedlings grew faster in the canopy gaps than in the understory, regardless of soil type or trenching treatment (trench lined with root restriction cloth, trench open to colonization by neighboring roots, or no trench). The accumulation rate of live fine roots was unaffected by soil or light conditions. Finally, I altered nutrient heterogeneity of the gap and understory sites through the creation of fertilized microsites. Root proliferation into these microsites was enhanced only in the canopy gaps on the infertile soil. The differences between the two soil types in the amount of root length and biomass and in root proliferation responses suggest that the consequences of canopy gap formation may be dependent on background levels of soil fertility.

AB To quantify C and N mineralization and the response of soil organisms in soil mixtures under controlled conditions, I set up a laboratory soil replacement series with soil from a pure spruce and a pure birch stand. To examine the role of a key species on process rates, the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa was added to half of the microcosms. Carbon mineralization and microbial biomass increased with the proportion of birch soil along the experimental mixtures, while N mineralization decreased. Microbial community structure (estimated by examining the phospholipid fatty acid pattern) changed linearly along the soil series. Carbon mineralization, microbial biomass, and microbial community structure in soil mixtures could therefore be predicted from the patterns in pure birch and spruce soils. However, the mineralization of N was lower in mixtures than predicted from the pure soils. Earthworms increased C and N mineralization, decreased microbial biomass, and modified microbial community structure, but they required at least 25% birch content in the soil mixture to be active throughout the experiment. The results suggest that microbial community structure and respiration are predictable in soil mixtures, but that earthworms exhibit thresholds and may respond in a nonlinear manner. Possible mechanisms behind the observed C and N mineralization pattern were explored with a simple model in which N mineralization was linked to the C how through microbes. The model suggests that nitrogen concentration of assimilated substrate may have been lower in birch soil than in spruce soil, although the opposite was true for bulk soil. Alternatively, the rate of inorganic nitrogen losses, through abiotic fixation to organic matter and/or gaseous losses, may have been higher in birch than in spruce soil.

AB We examined the patterns of foliar chemistry and insect herbivory in white oak (Quercus alba), chestnut oak (e. prinus), and red maple (Acer rubrum) trees occupying an upland oak forest on the Walker Branch Watershed in Tennessee. Different size classes of each species were sampled to evaluate life cycle changes in foliar N and phenolic chemistry and their corresponding influence on insect herbivory. Oak trees had consistently higher foliar N and hydrolyzable tannin concentrations, and they experienced greater herbivore damage than did red maple trees; maple trees had higher condensed tannin levels. Foliar chemistry and herbivore damage were usually quite similar for all size classes. However, condensed tannins, and occasionally total phenolics, were higher in well-insolated mature trees than in shaded understory conspecifics, fitting the pattern expected through plant carbon/nutrient balance relationships.
   Rainfall fluctuations during 1992-1994 significantly influenced plant-herbivore processes. Foliar N and phenolic concentrations were reduced in all species during the much drier summer of 1993, relative to 1992. The summer drought in 1993 was apparently severe enough to restrict carbon allocation to plant phenolics. In contrast, foliar N levels in oaks were somewhat elevated by the end of the wet 1994 growing season. Total phenol and hydrolyzable tannin levels remained quite low in 1994, when carbon may have been preferentially allocated to growth rather than differentiation, as N uptake increased during the wet summer following drought. Nevertheless, carbon allocation to condensed tannins was quite high for all species during the wet summer. Insect herbivore damage was directly correlated with rainfall totals over the 3-yr period. Herbivore damage on oaks was reduced during the 1993 drought, principally because of less impact by leaf skeletonizers. Insect feeding on oaks and maples was elevated during the wet 1994 summer, when strip feeding by lepidoptera larvae was at its highest. Our findings suggest that herbivore damage at Walker Branch appears to be largely dependent on the response of specific insect feeding guilds to moisture-related changes in foliar N and plant phenolics.

AB Boreal forest fire and vegetation history was examined using an 840-yr fossil pollen and charcoal record from a site dominated by Picea glauca in Alberta, Canada. The record tvas created using contiguous 5-yr samples of annually laminated sediments from a 2.7-ha lake (Rainbow Lake A in Wood Buffalo National Park).
   Following a peak in the microscopic charcoal accumulation rate (CHAR), there is a sequence of peaks in sediment thickness and in 14 of the 21 common pollen and spore taxa, The general pollen sequence is an initial peak in herbs, then shrubs, then deciduous trees, and finally conifers and ?Sphagnum. The peak value for each taxon differs following individual fires, suggesting that a site does not undergo the same postfire vegetation sequence following all, fires,
   Based an the CHAR, pollen, and sediment thickness records, at least 12 large, local fires are apparent. The average time interval between the 12 fires is 69 yr. Significant periodicities in CHAR and in II of the pollen laxa range between 95 and 185 yr. These estimates of the mean fire interval are broadly similar to the 71-142 yr fire cycle for Picea glauca forests, estimated by dendrochronological analysis of regional forests.
   The pollen taxa also exhibit long-term changes in relative abundance. An initial dominance by Pic ea cf, glauca is terminated by a fire around AD 1185 and is replaced by Populus dominance between AD 1250 and 1550; the fire is followed by an 800-yr period of increasing abundance of Picea cf, glauca., Herbs and shrubs generally exhibit a peak in abundance between AD 1350 and 1750., These long-term patterns may reflect climatic change, response to fires with different characteristics, or rearrangement of the forest patches around Rainbow Lake A.

AB The foraging ecology of King Penguins (Aptenodytes paragonicus) at Possession Island, Crozet Archipelago, was studied between January and March 1993 and between February and March 1994. Diving activity and position of the birds were determined via externally attached logging units. Feeding behavior was detected using stomach temperature sensors.
   All calculated positions of the birds occurred south of Possession Island. The area most frequented was situated 250 km south of the island (48.5 degrees S), where birds stayed for 40 h during a foraging trip, on average. The overall swim speed differed with time into the foraging trip, being lowest during the central part and highest (10 km/h) during the last night at sea, when birds were returning to the colony. Diving activities showed a clear diurnal pattern, with maximum dive depth being dependent on ambient light levels. During the night, only shallow dives <30 m were made, whereas deep dives occurred only during daylight. Preferred dive depths during deep diving ranged from 100 to 200 m. Maximum dive depth was 323 m, and maximum dive duration was 9.2 min. Vertical velocity (rate of change of depth) and dive duration were significantly correlated with increasing dive depth. Time spent at depth changed with time into the foraging trip, with most time being spent in deep water strata during the central phase, whereas predominately shallow dives were executed at the beginning and at the end of the foraging trips. Feeding success was closely linked to time of day, dive depth, and time into the foraging trip. Overall, >85% of the feeding events occurred during daylight and at twilight. Mean food mass ingested was calculated to be similar to 2350 g/d, with the highest amounts ingested during the central and penultimate days of the foraging trip. Foraging success (grams ingested per unit time underwater) was also highest (>370 g/h) at this time. The relationships between foraging strategy, inter- and intraspecific competition, and King Penguin body mass are discussed.

AB We present field evidence for the induction of overcompensation, or increased fruit and seed yield as a consequence of damage, in the grassland biennial field gentian, Gentianella campestris (Gentianaceae). We compared equally sized clipped and unclipped plants in two populations in central Sweden during three years, 1992-1994, and plants clipped at different occasions, from 20 June to 2 August.
   Clipping once, by removing half of the biomass, significantly increased fruit production without affecting the number of seeds per fruit or seed mass. The degree of compensation was sensitive to the timing of clipping. Damage induced overcompensation only during a restricted inductive time period (ITP) in July. Plants clipped before about 1 July or after about 22 July achieved no overcompensation. The early limit of ITP was presumably determined by the availability of resources that could be mobilized for regrowth after damage. The late limit, on the other hand, depended primarily on the differentiation of meristems close to flowering in early August.
   The effects of clipping varied between years, presumably due to drought in 1994. During 1992-1993, plants consistently overcompensated for clipping on 1-20 July, whereas in 1994 only early clipping from 1 to 12 July induced overcompensation. In 1994, plants clipped in late July compensated less well, due to delayed fruit maturation leading to a high proportion of immature fruits at the end of the season. Because of this between-year variation, we used geometric mean fitness to calculate the expected long-term effects of damage over generations. The analysis suggests that the long-term effects can vary from positive to negative, depending on the frequency of bad fruiting years.
   The time limits of ITP fit well the hypothesis that predictable damage in July may have selected for a capacity of overcompensation in the field gentian. Because the ultimate limits of ITP are set by the length of the vegetation period, we expect overcompensation in this species to be more common in regions with a longer growing season.
