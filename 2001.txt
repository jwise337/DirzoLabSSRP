AB The effects of logging on ecosystem sustainability are controversial. Surprisingly, existing data are inadequate to allow a comprehensive evaluation of logging effects on biodiversity, composition, and productivity since appropriate comparisons of stands of similar ages and differing disturbance histories are rare. We addressed this issue using a study of 2000 plots in 80 southern boreal forest stands in northern Minnesota, USA, wherein we contrasted naturally regenerated aspen (Populus tremuloides), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), and black spruce (Picea mariana) stands established following logging or the dominant natural disturbance, wildfire, for stands of two age classes (25-40 and 70-100 yr old). For young stands, those established postlogging had higher vascular plant diversity than those postwildfire. Otherwise, we found no evidence of differing species diversity (including canopy tree, shrub, herbaceous, and bryophyte species), composition, productivity, or nitrogen cycling, in forest stands of comparable age and forest type that originated after logging compared to after wildfire. These variables, however, differed significantly among forest types, with aboveground net primary productivity and plant species diversity generally higher in aspen than jack pine stands, even when growing on comparable soils, and lowest in black spruce. Although there is evidence that logging has increased the proportional landscape dominance by aspen, a forest type with higher diversity, nutrient cycling, and productivity than other types, our evidence refutes the idea that disturbance by logging has diminished stand-scale productivity or plant diversity in comparison to the common natural disturbance, wildfire.

AB Bias in the adult sex ratio of a population, if not due to a biased primary sex ratio, may be due to differential mortality of males and females, which can occur during any life history stage. Yet, although adult sex-ratio bias is common in dioecious plant species, little is known about the demography of prereproductive individuals. Using a RAPD-PCR (randomly amplified polymorphic DNA) marker that co-segregates with female phenotype, I studied juvenile demography in the saltmarsh grass Distichlis spicata, which exhibits within-population sex-ratio variation (spatial segregation of the sexes) and has genetic sex determination. First. I surveyed populations of D. spicata to ascertain whether any environmental factor co-varies with local sex ratio, and I found that habitats with female majorities are located at significantly lower elevations in the marsh than are habitats with male majorities. In randomly collected seeds, the sex ratio was significantly biased toward females. but male and female seeds did not differ in mass. Using a subsample of these seeds. I conducted greenhouse and field experiments to examine whether differences in seed germination or seedling survival between the sexes explain sex-ratio variation along the micro-elevation gradient in the marsh. In greenhouse treatments designed to mimic field habitats with female majorities, more male seeds germinated than did female seeds. In habitats with female majorities in the field, significantly more female seedlings survived an extreme high tide than did male seedlings (25.17% of females vs. 13.49% of males). These results suggest that, in habitats with female majorities. gender-specific bias in seedling survivorship, rather than seed germination, is a causal factor in the underlying sex-ratio bias. In habitats with male majorities, seed germination and seedling survival did not differ between the sexes. This study is the first to document environment-dependent differential seed germination and seedling mortality between males and females in a dioecious plant species.

AB Changes in environmental conditions often alter the traits of individuals; however, we have a poor understanding of how changes in phenotypically plastic traits early in development may affect traits later in life. Such effects are of particular interest in organisms with complex life cycles in which early and late life stages can have drastically different morphologies and occupy different habitats. In this study, I examined how differences in the mass, morphology. and larval period of wood frog tadpoles (Rana sylvatica) subsequently affected the mass and morphology of metamorphic frogs. I found three major patterns: (1) larval mass and larval period were positively related to metamorphic mass; (2) larval period was positively related to metamorph hindlimb and forelimb length and negatively related to metamorph body width; and (3) larval body length was positively related to metamorph forelimb size. I then used these correlations to interpret the connection between the traits of predator-induced tadpoles and the subsequent traits of metamorphic frogs. Tadpoles reared with caged predators (aeshnid dragonflies) developed relatively deeper tail fins and had shorter bodies, lower mass, and longer developmental times than tadpoles reared without predators. Metamorphs emerging from larval predator environments exhibited no differences in mass but developed relatively large hindlimbs and forelimbs and narrower bodies than metamorphs emerging from predator-free larval environments. These differences arose primarily due to predator-induced changes in larval development time and not due to the predator-induced changes in larval morphology. By focusing on a large number of traits and a wide range of trait values. one can readily gene;ate predictions about how a variety of environments. which alter traits early in development, can, subsequently alter traits later in development.

AB The maintenance of species diversity by treefall gaps is a long-standing paradigm in forest ecology. Gaps are presumed to provide an environment in which tree species of differing competitive abilities partition heterogeneous resources. The empirical evidence to support this paradigm, however, remains scarce, and some recent studies even suggest that gaps do not maintain the diversity of shade-tolerant species. Although there is evidence that gaps maintain the diversity of pioneer trees, most of this evidence comes from studies that did not make comparisons between gaps and intact forest sites (controls). Further, nearly all studies on the maintenance of diversity by gaps have ignored Iianas, an important component of both old-world and neotropical forests. We tested the hypothesis that treefall gaps maintain shade-tolerant tree, pioneer tree, and liana species diversity in an old-growth forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. We compared the density and species richness of these guilds between paired gap and non-gap sites on both a per-area and a per-individual (per capita) basis. We found no difference in shade-tolerant tree density and species richness between the gap and non-gap sites. Both pioneer tree and liana density and species richness, however, were significantly higher in the gap than in the nongap sites on both a per-area and a per-individual basis. These results suggest that gaps maintain liana species diversity and that this effect is not merely a consequence of increased density. Furthermore, our data confirm the long-held belief that gaps maintain pioneer tree species diversity. Because lianas and pioneer trees combined account for similar to 43% of the woody plant species on BCI, and in other forests, our results are likely to be broadly applicable and suggest that gaps play a strong role in the maintenance of woody species diversity.

AB We studied the effects of a seven-year warming experiment on 11 forb species in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado in 1996 and 1997. Previous work on this experiment focused on ecosystem and community responses to warming. Our purpose here is to report on species responses. We found significant positive responses to warming for two species and negative responses for four species in terms of abundance, size, flowering, or frost damage. Because previous results from the warming experiment showed that artificial warming decreases soil moisture and increases nitrogen mineralization, we used nitrogen and water addition experiments on the two dominant forbs to determine whether species responses in the warming experiment could be due to shifts in resource availability. We found that Erigeron speciosus was limited more clearly by water than by nitrogen and Helianthella quinquenervis was limited by both nitrogen and water. These responses are consistent with the hypothesis that a primary effect of warming on plants occurs via changes in soil resource availability, but more complicated factors including competition are likely to be important to warming effects as well. Because previous work on this experiment indicated that annual forb detrital production is a key component of the carbon cycle of this system, we also asked which species responded to warming with changes in aboveground biomass. Over 1996 and 1997, four of nine perennial species had significantly lower biomass in the warmed plots, and in 1997 one species had significantly higher biomass. The biomass differences of Erigeron and Helianthella were almost equal and opposite, but while the decline in Erigeron was statistically significant the increase in Helianthella was smaller and not significant. In one year, a major effect of warming was to protect Helianthella from frost damage, which illustrates the importance of extreme weather events. Our study points to the potential importance of understanding ecosystem responses to climate change in terms of species responses.

AB To evaluate the effects of larval environment on postmetamorphic performance in the spadefoot toad, Spea hammondii, larvae were reared at one of two densities, creating groups of small and large terrestrial juveniles. These terrestrial juveniles were reared, either individually in the laboratory or in groups in outdoor tanks, at high and low food levels until they were 1 yr old. Larger terrestrial juveniles had higher probabilities of survival to 1 yr of age than smaller juveniles. Larval density did not strongly affect the maximum postmetamorphic growth rate of metamorphs. Body mass differences resulting from larval environment were maintained or slightly increased over the first year of terrestrial growth. The only exception occurred among males receiving high food after metamorphosis in both the laboratory and outdoor tanks; here the size differences disappeared. Larval environment did not influence the proportion of males reaching maturity in their first year. No females matured in their first year; this difference in the rate of maturation in males and females is consistent with published field studies. In outdoor tanks, males from the high-density larval treatment were active on the surface more often than those from the low-density larval treatment. These results are in general agreement with previous studies that have suggested that small size at metamorphosis is associated with lower adult fitness, in this case through lower survival and smaller body sizes. However, the results of this study suggest that the extent to which larval environment can influence subsequent terrestrial characteristics, such as growth and behavior, may vary with sex and terrestrial food availability.

AB We developed a conceptual model for evaluating the benefits of wind pollination to mast-flowering species. The benefit that a plant population gains from mast flowering via increased wind pollination efficiency was predicted from how far pollination efficiency at mean seed crop size falls below the maximum. Species were most likely! to benefit from mast seeding if mean reproductive effort in the field gave an intermediate level of pollination efficiency, regardless of the cost of unpollinated female structures. To quantify the benefits of different degrees of mast flowering, a simulation model was used to alter the seed production coefficient of variation (cv) and to calculate its effects on weighted mean pollination efficiency. The model was applied to seven real data sets for five species with pollination benefits from masting that ranged from relatively small (Chionochloa pallens), to moderate (Dacrydium cupressinum, Betula alleghaniensis), to large (Nothofagus solandri, N. menziesii).
   Many studies have reported higher seed production coefficients of variation at higher altitudes and latitudes within a species. Our model showed that higher coefficients of variation are favored by reduced mean seed output per plant at higher altitudes. Data for N. solandri at three altitudes in one site showed much higher pollination benefits from masting at higher altitudes. Reduced plant density (e.g., through fragmentation), which also lowers mean flowering effort per unit area, resulted in large increases in masting benefits in N. solandri, but only small increases in C. pallens. These contrasting results were primarily due to differences between the two species in mean reproductive effort vs. wind pollination efficiency, rather than to differences in the effects of fragmentation and altitude.
   The relative effects of masting on pollination, insect seed predation, and bird seed predation were modeled in B. alleghaniensis. Masting produced a small economy of scale from insect predator satiation, but an almost equivalent diseconomy of scale resulted from increased levels of bird seed predation. Efficiency of wind pollination improved moderately with increasing Cv, providing some overall benefits from masting in this species. Accordingly, we propose that masting can be favored by either one dominant economy of scale (such as wind pollination efficiency in N. solandri or predator satiation in C. pallens), or a balance among several factors (such as pollination, predator satiation, and predator attraction in B. alleghaniensis). We predict that, in the absence of any selective benefits or disadvantages of masting, plants would be expected to have coefficients of variation in the range 0.85-1.35.

AB Nonparametric multivariate analysis of ecological data using permutation tests has two main challenges: (1) to partition the variability in the data according to a complex design or model, as is often required in ecological experiments, and (2) to base the analysis on a multivariate distance measure (such as the semimetric Bray-Curtis measure) that is reasonable for ecological data sets. Previous nonparametric methods have succeeded in one or other of these areas, but not in both. A recent contribution to Ecological Monographs by Legendre and Anderson, called distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA), does achieve both. It does this by calculating principal coordinates and subsequently correcting for negative eigenvalues, if they are present, by adding a constant to squared distances. We show here that such a correction is not necessary. Partitioning can be achieved directly from the distance matrix itself, with no corrections and no eigenanalysis, even if the distance measure used is semimetric. An ecological example is given to show the differences in these statistical methods. Empirical simulations, based on parameters estimated from real ecological species abundance data, showed that db-RDA done on multifactorial designs (using the correction) does not have type I error consistent with the significance level chosen for the analysis (i.e., does not provide an exact test), whereas the direct method described and advocated here does.

AB The nonnative mudsnail Batillaria attramentaria was introduced to the west coast of North America in the early part of this century and has been displacing the native mudsnail Cerithidea californica on a marsh-by-marsh basis. We combined detailed, quantitative field data on this invader and its interactions with the native snail in an individual-based model that allowed us to address both general questions about the mechanism of displacement of native species and more specific concerns about detecting the trajectory and impact of the invasion. In empirically parameterized simulations the native snail was driven extinct within 55-70 yr after introduction of Batillaria, which closely matches direct field estimates. We then tested the relative importance of Batillaria's demonstrated advantages in parasitism resistance (top-down effect), exploitative competition (bottom-up effect), and mortality rate (demographic advantage) in driving its displacement of Cerithidea. With its demographic advantage maintained, but without its advantages in competition and parasitism, Batillaria still drove Cerithidea extinct within 90 yr. Only when Batillaria's mortality rate was set equal to that of Cerithidea could the native snail persist indefinitely, demonstrating this factor's overwhelming influence on the success of this invasion. The difference in mortality between the species was large relative to the other differences, but further simulations showed that the importance of this difference stems not just from its magnitude, but also from the sensitivity of this system to this demographic rate. Identification of the relative importance of mechanisms that contribute to an invader's success is one of the major benefits of such modeling efforts.
   To identify empirically measurable quantities that provide the earliest warning of impact on the native species, we tracked many population- and individual-level responses of Cerithidea to Batillaria's invasion, including population density, biomass, egg production, mean size, proportion of infected individuals, and individual growth rate, as well as availability of shared food resources. We used the empirically observed parameter values and an initial number of Batillaria invaders in these: simulations that guaranteed extinction of Cerithidea within 90 yr. Despite a rapid initial increase in invader populations, all metrics for Cerithidea were slow to exhibit signs of impact. Most took at least 25 yr from invasion to exhibit detectable changes, by which time the nonnative species was established at high densities (> 3000 snails/m(2)). Cerithidea egg production was the fastest, most consistent response metric exhibiting declines within 20-25 yr after invasion in similar to 90% of simulations. Difficulty in finding reliable, early warning metrics has crucial implications for how we should view and conduct monitoring programs and risk assessment analyses.

AB A central hypothesis of biogeography is that consumer-prey interactions are more intense at lower latitudes. leading to increased defenses of prey. Because plants vary in many traits that might affect palatability to herbivores. however. studies of latitudinal variation in single plant traits such as secondary chemistry provide only circumstantial evidence to test this hypothesis. We directly compared the palatability of 10 salt marsh plants from seven northern (Rhode Island and Maine) and eight southern (Georgia and Florida) coastal salt marshes by flying fresh plant material back and forth and allowing 13 species of herbivores direct choices between northern and southern conspecific plants in laboratory assays. In 127 of 149 assays (85%), herbivores showed a significant or marginally significant preference for northern plants. In only one assay did herbivores prefer southern plants. These results occurred regardless of the geographic location of the assay, herbivore species, year, or season of plant collection, although there were hints that latitudinal differences became less pronounced for two plant species late in the growing season. Our results provide the most comprehensive evidence to date for a latitudinal gradient in plant palatability in any community. The proximate plant traits and the ultimate evolutionary factors responsible for this pattern remain to be determined.

AB Patterns of larval parasitism among species in the macrolepidopteran assemblages on two riparian tree species, Acer negundo L. (box elder) and Salix nigra (Marsh) (black willow) were examined. Larvae were collected throughout the growing season for five years and reared for parasitoid emergence. Total parasitism of larvae on box elder was significantly higher than that of larvae on black willow. Comparisons of parasitism levels among lepidopteran families showed that in five of seven families larval parasitism on box elder was significantly higher than on black willow. For species whose larvae were found on both tree species, total parasitism was significantly higher when the larvae were on box elder than when larvae of the same species were on black willow. In comparisons of species found on both tree species, larvae in three of seven families suffered significantly higher levels of parasitism when on box elder than when on black willow. The roles of the functional/numerical responses of parasitoids, common and numerically dominant parasitoid species, and plant volatiles are considered as causal mechanisms underlying differential parasitism but are not supported by the data.

AB Organisms that produce alternative, nondiscrete phenotypes in response to environmental conditions are expected to alter their phenotypes in relation to the degree of environmental change. This idea has been applied to the evolution of antipredator responses by prey, in which it has been hypothesized that prey should respond more strongly to predators that pose greater mortality risk. In a companion paper, I quantified predator-induced behavioral and morphological responses in six species of larval anurans across five different predator environments and found that these responses were prey- and predator-specific. In the present study, I addressed whether the responses were related to the level of predation risk posed by each of the predators. Within each prey species, I found that different predators posed different levels of predation risk; within each predator species, different prey species experienced different levels of risk. The differences in predation risk could be understood mechanistically after I quantified differences among predators in their ability to capture, handle, and consume prey and differences among prey in behavior and morphology. Using multivariate analyses, I found that predation risk had no significant effect on how a given prey responds to predators, although there were significant univariate behavioral effects; higher predation risk was related to greater decreases in activity and greater spatial avoidance. I also examined the relationship between risk and response across the six prey species within a predator treatment and found that higher predation risk across species leads to greater decreases in activity in the presence of Umbra and greater increases in tail depth in the presence of Anax. Thus, while previous studies have found relationships between predation risk and prey response when focusing on relatively few species, few predators, and a single trait, this more powerful test using 30 predator-prey combinations and nine traits suggests that the relationship is not well supported. This finding arises from the fact that larval anurans, as well as many other taxa, exhibit predator- and prey-specific behavioral and morphological changes in response to predator- and prey-specific risk.

AB In tropical forests, lianas (woody vines) are important structural parasites of trees. We assessed the effects of forest fragmentation, treefall disturbance, soils, and stand attributes on liana communities in central Amazonian rain forests. Over 27 500 liana stems (greater than or equal to2 cm diameter at breast height [dbh]) were recorded in 27 1-ha plots in continuous forest and 42 plots in 10 forest fragments ranging from 1 to 100 ha in area. For each plot, an index of forest disturbance was determined from a 20-yr study of tree-community dynamics, and 19 soil-texture and chemistry parameters were derived from soil surface samples (top 20 cm).
   Liana abundance was 187-701 stems/ha, and liana aboveground dry biomass varied from 3.7 to 12.3 Mg/ha. Liana abundance increased significantly near forest edges and was significantly positively associated with forest disturbance and significantly negatively associated with tree biomass. Liana biomass was similarly associated with disturbance and tree biomass but also increased significantly along soil-fertility gradients. Plots near forest edges had a significantly higher proportion of small (2-3 c-m dbh) lianas and relatively fewer large (greater than or equal to4 cm dbh) lianas than did sites in forest interiors.
   Liana communities were further assessed by comparing their species richness, composition, climbing guilds, and frequency of tree infestation in three 10-ha fragments. Within each fragment, data were collected in 24 small (400-m(2)) plots, with half of the plots near edges and half in interiors. Significantly more trees were infested on fragment edges than in interiors. All three major guilds (branch-twiners, mainstem-twiners, tendril-twiners) were significantly more abundant on edges. Species diversity of lianas (as measured by Fisher's diversity index) also was significantly higher on edges, and this was not simply an artifact of increased liana abundance on edges.
   We conclude that many aspects of liana community structure are affected by habitat fragmentation, and we suggest that lianas can have important impacts on forest dynamics and functioning in fragmented rain forests. By creating physical stresses on trees and competing for light and nutrients, heavy liana infestations appear partly responsible for the dramatically elevated rates of tree mortality and damage observed near fragment edges.

AB Biological communities are frequently exposed to environmental changes that cause measurable responses in properties of the community (hereafter called environmental drivers). Predicting how communities respond to changing environmental drivers is a fundamental goal of ecology. Making predictions, however. can be very difficult, particularly when multiple environmental drivers change simultaneously and there are interactions among the drivers. We investigated the effects of the interaction between changes in nutrient loading and changes in colored dissolved organic matter (measured as dissolved organic carbon. DOC) on the dynamics of phytoplankton communities over a 7-yr period. In 1991, Long Lake, a small seepage lake in northern Michigan, was divided vertically, from sediment surface to water surface, with plastic curtains as part of a whole-lake experiment. The accompanying changes in hydrology led to increases in DOC concentration in one of the basins. Nutrients were added to both basins from 1993 to 1997, causing dramatic changes in phytoplankton community composition. We used multivariate autoregressive models to help interpret the patterns of phytoplankton community composition observed during the experiment. DOC and nutrient addition had diverse effects on phytoplankton: some taxonomic and morphological groups were directly affected by the changes in DOC and nutrients. whereas other groups experienced indirect effects via their interactions with groups that were directly affected. Model results suggest that there was an interaction between the effects of DOC and nutrients for many groups of phytoplankton, Such that differences in DOC concentration accounted for differences between basins in response to nutrient addition. The effects of DOC can be explained by changes in physical structure (e.g., thermocline depth and transparency) and water chemistry (e.g., pH) that accompanied changes in DOC concentration. The interaction between DOC and nutrients suggests that predicting community responses to multiple drivers cannot be achieved by simply adding up the effects of single drivers.

AB Within any particular landscape. patch structure and dynamics likely will differ among habitat types because of environmental differences influencing the intensity and outcome of biological interactions. We compared the dynamics of natural and experimentally constructed mussel patches (Mytilus trossulus and M. edulis) in two intertidal habitats, tidepools and emergent rock, over a time series (5, 10, 15 mo) and among seasons (three successive 5-mo intervals). In tidepools, mussels naturally occurred in small patches (median < 25 cm(2)). In contrast, mussels on emergent rock formed extensive beds with decimeter-scale gaps., but these beds start as small patches following disturbance such as ice scour. For our experimental patches (15 cm(2)) in both habitats, we assessed the relative importance of physical (wave disturbance) and biological (predation, growth, recruitment, and immigration) processes in determining patch size and structure. Although individual experimental and natural patches varied greatly in size over time, mean patch area remained relatively constant. In general, mean size of individuals in experimental patches decreased due to the loss of larger mussels while numbers increased due to recruitment. Wave disturbance, which removes and redistributes mussels, appeared to be more important than predation (by the whelk Nucella lapillus) in determining patch structure and dynamics on this shore, although losses due to either process did not differ consistently between habitats over time. Individual growth rates were low (shell length less than or equal to0.4 mm/mo) but greater in tidepools than on emergent rock, whereas recruitment and immigration rates generally did not differ between habitats. Although each process contributed to changes in patch size and structure, collectively they did not result in a marked divergence in mean patch area or biomass between tidepools and emergent rock over the 15-mo experiment. We suggest that the broad patterns of distribution and abundance of mussels develop slowly on this shore largely because of low individual growth rates. Over time scales of years, however, positive relationships between individual growth and recruitment rates and patch size may accelerate the expansion of aggregations on emergent rock. Mussel assemblages at our site differ from those examined in many other studies in terms of the relative importance of wave dislodgment and predation as causes of loss and in the role of growth in offsetting these losses, This study shows how integrative approaches, with monitoring of patches and individuals within patches, can provide detailed mechanistic understanding of patch structure and dynamics.

AB I examined the long-term consequences of a trade-off between predation risk and resource acquisition for the garden skink (Lampropholis guichenoti) by rearing hatchlings to maturity in outdoor enclosures covered with snake predator scent (mimicking high predator densities) or control scent (mimicking low predator densities). Open areas provided optimal foraging and basking sites but were covered with scent, whereas retreat sites provided suboptimal foraging and basking opportunities and were not scented. During the initial six months of the experiment, lizards reared in enclosures covered with scent from a natural predator became active later in the day, showed reduced mobility, and selected "safer" substrate microhabitats than did lizards raised in enclosures covered with control scent. These behavioral shifts reduced opportunities to forage and bask for lizards in the predator-scented enclosures. During the study, however, lizards from predator-scented enclosures became gradually less responsive to snake chemical cues, and after one year there were no differences in the activity patterns and substrate microhabitat use of lizards in both treatments. This pattern of behavior is paralleled by variation in growth rates of lizards. Throughout the study, lizards exposed to predator scent were lighter and shorter than were lizards exposed to control scent. However, this result reflects differential rates of growth by lizards only during the first six months of the experiment. Nevertheless, lizards that grew slowly early in life, as a consequence of predator avoidance, attained smaller body sizes at maturity and produced lighter clutch masses and offspring. Thus, predator avoidance tactics employed early in a lizard's life can impose long-term fitness costs.

AB Anadromous Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) transport marine-derived nitrogen (MDN) to the rivers in which they reproduce. Isotopic analyses indicate that trees and shrubs near spawning streams derive similar to 22-24% of their foliar nitrogen (N) from spawning salmon. As a consequence of this nutrient subsidy, growth rates are significantly increased in Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) near spawning streams. As riparian forests affect the quality of instream habitat through shading, sediment and nutrient filtration, and production of large woody debris (LWD), this fertilization process serves not only to enhance riparian production, but may also act as a positive feedback mechanism by which salmon-borne nutrients improve spawning and rearing habitat for subsequent salmon generations and maintain the long-term productivity of river corridors along the Pacific coast of North America.

AB We used simulation modeling to investigate the relative importance of current environmental conditions and factors affecting establishment of different plant species on the formation of vegetative zonation patterns. We compared the results from a series of six models that incorporated increasing amounts of information about key factors affecting species' ability to adjust to water-level fluctuations. We assessed model accuracy using aerial photographs taken of a 10-yr field experiment. in which 10 wetlands were flooded to 1 in above normal water level for 2 yr, drawn down for or 2 yr, and reflooded for 5 yr to three different water levels (normal, +0.3 in. +0.6 m). We compared each model's ability to predict relative areal cover of five dominant emergent species and to recreate the spatial structure of the landscape as measured by mean area of monospecific stands of vegetation and the degree to which the species were intermixed.
   The simplest model predicted post-treatment species distributions using logistic regressions based on initial species distributions along the water-depth gradient in the experimental wetlands. Subsequent models were based on germination, rhizomatous dispersal, and mortality functions implemented in each cell of a spatial grid. We tested the effect on model accuracy of incrementally adding data on five factors that can alter the composition and distribution of vegetative zones following a shift in environmental conditions: (1) spatial relationships between areas of suitable habitat (landscape geometry), (2) initial spatial distribution of adults, (3) the presence of ruderal species in the seed bank, (4) the distribution of seed densities in the seed bank, and (5) differential seedling survivorship.
   Because replicated, long-term data are generally not available, the evaluation of these models represents the first experimental test, of which we are aware, of the ability of a cellular-automaton-type model to predict changes in plant species' distributions.
   Establishment constraints, such as recruitment from the seed bank, were most important during low-water periods and immediately following a change in water depth. Subsequent to a drop in water level, the most detailed models made the most accurate predictions. The accuracy of all the models converged in 1-2 years after an increase in water level, indicating that current environmental conditions became more important under stable conditions than the effects of historical recruitment events.

AB The effects of the experimental fragmentation of native eucalypt forest on the beetle community were tested, in a controlled. replicated, long-term experiment, Included in our design were three fragment sizes, fragment edge and interior sites. and sites in the surrounding exotic pine plantation matrix. We followed 325 species through 28 sampling periods over seven years, including two years pre-fragmentation. We examined effects of fragmentation on four attributes of community structure: (1) species richness, (2) species composition, (3) relative abundance. and (4) the changes in occurrence of all species individually by the traits of rarity, degree of isolation (dispersal ability), and trophic group. We also considered how changes in these attributes altered community dynamics (turnover).
   We used both community-level and species-level responses to determine the relative importance of processes acting at the within-patch and between-patch scales.
   At the within-patch scale there were two findings. (1) There was no evidence of an increase in the extinction rate on fragments, as was hypothesized. Neither species richness nor the occurrence of rare species declined on fragments compared to continuous forest. (2) Edge effects altered species occurrences and abundances on fragments compared to continuous forest. There was evidence of two edge effects, with different penetration distances. Species richness increased at fragment edges in response to a shallowly penetrating edge effect. Species relative abundance and composition changed on fragments in response to a deeply penetrating edge effect. which also caused increases in the occurrences of detritivores and fungivores.
   At the between-patch scale there were three findings. (1) There was no evidence of a reduction in the colonization rate of fragments. There was no reduction in species richness or in the occurrence of individual species with poor dispersal abilities on fragments compared to continuous forest. (2) The matrix between fragments altered between-patch processes by providing alternative habitat for some species. These species increased in occurrence on fragments compared to continuous forest, supporting the predictions of recent metacommunity theory. However, the matrix did not act as a source of invading species. (3) Turnover was reduced in fragments compared to continuous forest. Thus, the effect of fragmentation was to stabilize community dynamics.

AB Within a plant species, environmental heterogeneity has the potential to influence the distribution of genetic variation among populations through several evolutionary processes, including natural selection, differential gene exchange, and chance associations caused by genetic drift or founder effects. We evaluated the relationship between environmental characteristics and the distribution of genotypes for three common woody species (Quercus alba, Carya tomentosa, and Sassafras albidum) in Missouri Ozark forests. We measured the correlation between multivariate genotypes and forest structure variables, and assessed the influence of physical landscape on multivariate genotypes. For all three species, we found significant relationships between genetic variation and environmental heterogeneity. We discovered that populations in local habitat patches with different forest structures also differed in combinations of multivariate genotypes. In contrast, we did not detect significant differences in multivariate genotypes among soil-type/aspect classes in any of the three study species, suggesting that genotypic differentiation is operating on a finer scale than soil or aspect differences. We conclude that natural selection, possibly interacting with founder events, has influenced the population differentiation of these three long-lived plant species. Such microgeographic variation in response to environmental heterogeneity is expected for a broad range of species, even when extensive gene flow is present.

AB Pathogens have important effects on host growth. behavior, and population dynamics. Nevertheless, the impact of parasitic infection on host populations may be strongly context dependent. For example, the outcome of host-pathogen interactions may be subject to change based on the level of abiotic stress experienced by the host. In northeastern Connecticut. USA, larvae of the gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) co-occur in temporary and permanent ponds with a snail (Pseudosuccinea columella) that is frequently infected with a digenetic trematode (Telorchis sp.) whose free-swimming cercariae subsequently infect H. versicolor tadpoles. Field collections of H. versicolor tadpoles suggest that the prevalence of infection by trematodes can be as high as 71%. We measured survival, mass, and time to metamorphosis of larval gray treefrogs in an artificial pond experiment designed to determine how infection with trematode cercariae and the stress of pond drying interact to influence gray treefrog performance. We exposed gray treefrog tadpoles to infected snails, uninfected snails. or no snails, within artificial ponds that were either permanent or subjected to a 49-d drying regime. The presence of infected P. columella had strong negative effects on the performance of gray treefrog larvae. However. this effect depended on whether ponds were temporary or permanent. When tadpoles were exposed to infected snails in temporary ponds. survivorship to metamorphosis decreased by similar to 30%. and mass at metamorphosis was reduced by 40%. The presence of infected P. columella had no detectable effect on larval performance of gray treefrogs in permanent ponds. Assays of infection level (mean number of cysts per individual) indicate that temporary pond animals were exposed to higher rates of infection. In contrast. uninfected snails had very little effect on H. versicolor in either temporary or permanent pools. There was. however, a small increase in time to metamorphosis for H. versicolor in permanent pools that were exposed to increased densities of uninfected snails. Our results indicate that an endemic parasite can have large effects on the performance of its native host, but that these effects may be strongly context dependent. Given this strong context dependence, an important challenge is to assay these effects within the natural environment.

AB Conspecific brood parasitism occurs in many birds and some insects, fishes, and amphibians. Here, we develop and test a novel molecular technique for ecological analysis, protein fingerprinting (PF), based on isoelectric focusing electrophoresis (IEF) in immobilized pH gradients. It is applied here to albumen from birds' eggs and permits accurate identification of eggs laid by different females. This technique greatly clarifies female alternative reproductive tactics and laying patterns in brood-parasitic Common Goldeneye ducks Bucephala clangula.
   A small, nondestructive sample of albumen is taken through a hole drilled through the eggshell, which is then sealed with superglue, preserving egg hatchability. IEF yields a rich pattern of albumen bands with extensive variation among females. Observation and video recording of egg-laying by 21 color-marked females showed that they had unique band patterns, which were fully repeatable within and between years.
   Brood parasitism occurred in two-thirds (13 of 19) of the video-recorded nests of color-ringed females, with up to five parasitic females per nest. Of 234 eggs, 36% were laid by females other than the incubating host. These results suggest that intraspecific brood parasitism is more common and important than suggested by earlier studies using traditional methods.
   Protein fingerprinting yields individual resolution similar to that of a DNA multilocus fingerprinting probe, and has several advantages. The albumen band pattern represents only the laying female, not her mate(s), making it easy to determine the maternity of eggs, and to identify a parasite that spreads her eggs among a number of nests. Albumen can be sampled as soon as the egg is laid, before predation or other losses occur, maximizing sample size and minimizing bias. Protein fingerprinting is relatively inexpensive and easy. It is also useful for several purposes other than maternity determination, such as relatedness estimation for categories of individuals.

AB The factors that determine the efficiency of energy transfer in aquatic food webs have been investigated for many decades. The plant-animal interface is the most variable and least predictable of all levels in the food web. In order to study determinants of food quality in a large lake and to test the recently proposed central importance of the long-chained eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) at the pelagic producer-grazer interface, we tested the importance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) at the pelagic producer-consumer interface by correlating sestonic food parameters with somatic growth rates of a clone of Daphnia galeata. Daphnia growth rates were obtained from standardized laboratory experiments spanning one season with Daphnia feeding on natural seston from Lake Constance, a large pre-alpine lake. Somatic growth rates were fitted to sestonic parameters by using a saturation function. A moderate amount of variation was explained when the model included the elemental parameters carbon (r(2) = 0.6) and nitrogen (r(2) = 0.71). A tighter fit was obtained when sestonic phosphorus was incorporated (r(2) = 0.86). The nonlinear regression with EPA was relatively weak (r(2) = 0.77), whereas the highest degree of variance was explained by three C-18-PUFAs. The best (r(2) = 0.95), and only significant, correlation of Daphnia's growth was found with the C-18-PUFA alpha -linolenic acid (alpha -LA; C18:3n-3). This correlation was weakest in late August when C:P values increased to 300, suggesting that mineral and PUFA-limitation of Daphnia's growth changed seasonally. Sestonic phosphorus and. some PUFAs showed not only tight correlations with growth, but also with sestonic alpha -LA content. We computed Monte Carlo simulations to test whether the observed effects of alpha -LA on growth could be accounted for by EPA, phosphorus, or one of the two C-18-PUFAs, stearidonic acid (C18:4n-3) and linoleic acid (C18:2n-6). With > 99 % probability, the correlation of growth with alpha -LA could not be explained by any of these parameters.
   In order to test for EPA limitation of Daphnia's growth, in parallel with experiments on pure seston, growth was determined on seston supplemented with chemostat-grown, P-limited Stephanodiscus hantzschii, which is rich in EPA. Although supplementation increased the EPA content 80-800X, no significant changes in the nonlinear regression of the growth rates with alpha -LA were found, indicating that growth of Daphnia on pure seston was not EPA limited. This indicates that the, two fatty acids, EPA and alpha -LA, were not mutually substitutable biochemical resources and points to different physiological functions of these two PUFAs. These results support the PUFA-limitation hypothesis for sestonic C:P < 300 but are contrary to the hypothesis of a general importance of EPA, since no evidence for EPA limitation was found. It is suggested that the resource ratios of EPA and alpha -LA rather than the absolute concentrations determine which of the two resources is limiting growth.

AB To examine the mediation of host-predator interaction by a parasite, we studied the three-level interactions among a host plant, a root hemiparasitic plants and their common predator., a generalist snail herbivore. The host species, Tr folium repens, is able to synthesize cyanogenic glucosides that have a significant role in plant herbivore resistance. Some T. repens populations are polymorphic with respect to cyanogenesis. Our second aim was to examine whether the mediation of the host plant-herbivore interaction by the parasitic plant could affect the maintenance of the cyanogenic polymorphism.
   The parasitic plant (Rhinanthus serotinits) was equally harmful to cyanogenic and acyanogenic hosts and grew equally well on both host types. In a no-choice experiment, both cyanogenesis and root hemiparasitism of the host plant reduced the growth of the herbivore (Arianta arbustorum). The herbivores consumed less leaf area of the parasitized plants than of unparasitized plants. but only when the host plant was acyanogenic. In a multiple-choice experiment, the snails were similarly affected by cyanogenesis but not by parasitic infection of the host. Thus, there was a discrepancy between food choice and performance of the herbivore. Our results suggest that the overall effects of the parasitic plant on the host plant were ameliorated through the indirect effects of the parasitic infection on herbivore performance and food consumption. This indirect effect of the parasitic infection seemed to be more beneficial for the acyanogenic plants: if parasitized, the leaf area of acyanogenic plants consumed by the herbivore was 45% higher than that of cyanogenic plants, whereas in unparasitized plants the corresponding figure was 114%. Thus, parasitism may decrease the advantage cyanogenic plants gain through decreased herbivory. Further, in mainly cyanogenic T. repens populations, cyanogenesis might be a more important feeding deterrent than root parasitism: whereas in mainly acyanogenic populations root parasitism might be relevant to herbivore-T. repens interactions. We are the first to document the effects of a plant parasite on the performance of both the host plant and a host-feeding herbivore. Our results highlight the need to look beyond the direct effect of parasites on their hosts.

AB Modular organisms consist of repeated building blocks. An important consequence of modularity may be reflected in the ability of a colony to continually reallocate priority of resource transport among its units in response to stress. Hermatypic corals, the main organisms constructing tropical reefs, are prone to damage by a multitude of agents. Since colonization of lesions by competitors is a potent threat to colonial organisms, fast recovery is an important component of colony survival. Previous regeneration studies have claimed that the energy requirements of this essential process are fueled only by the polyps directly bordering the injured area. This "localized regeneration hypothesis" rejects the necessity for wide colony integration during regeneration and sees no advantage to large colony size. The objective of the present study was to test an alternative regeneration hypothesis that argues, in contrast, that injury repair (i.e., closure of lesions by newly formed tissues) in corals may require extended colony integration (i.e., internal translocation of resources from sites of acquisition to sites of maximal demand). To test our hypothesis we examined: (1) the relationship between colony size and percentage recovery of lesions differing in size and shape; and (2) the effect of different sized lesions on the fecundity of polyps located at increasing distances from the lesion site. Both experiments were conducted on the common, spherically shaped coral Favia favus in the Red Sea near Eilat, Israel. The relatively small lesions (<1 cm(2)) were the only ones to support the localized regeneration hypothesis, since their recovery was unaffected by colony size. However, the two larger lesion types (approximate sizes of 2 cm(2) and 3 cm(2)) confirmed the importance of large colony size for achieving fast recovery. In the second experiment we found that small lesions, repeated monthly, caused only a localized reduction in fecundity, while larger monthly repeated lesions caused significant reductions in fecundity up to a distance of 15 cm away from their site. Both experiments indicate that regeneration from injury may require an extended magnitude of energy integration throughout the colony, and that the extent of this integration is regulated by the colony in accordance with lesion characteristics. It is also concluded that in long-lived organisms such as corals, there is a priority of energy allocation to recovery rather than to reproduction. Our findings reveal the existence of injury thresholds within a colony that determine energy allocation and intra-colonial translocation of energy products toward regions of maximal demand. We suggest that such injury thresholds may characterize many other coral species and that colony integration during stress is a basic life-preserving ability and one of the most important advantages of clonal and colonial organisms.

AB Although much of life-history theory assumes increased mortality at certain stages (e.g., migration), survival rates are rarely estimated on a seasonal basis within the annual cycle of migratory species. We estimated variations in seasonal survival rates in a long-lived, hunted species in the presence of short-term (between consecutive seasons) and long-term (between years in the same season) dependence in sighting probabilities. We also tested the two contrasting hypotheses that hunting mortality is either compensatory or additive to natural mortality. This study was conducted on adult female Greater Snow Geese (Chen caeruldescens atlantica) from 1990 to 1998, and is based on 3890 neck-banded birds and 13 657 resightings on the northern breeding grounds in summer, and southern staging areas in spring and autumn. Birds were 10-20% more likely to be seen in autumn and spring if they were seen on the previous occasion (summer and autumn, respectively). Birds were 30-40% more likely to be seen in autumn and spring if they were last seen in the same season in the previous year. Differences in behavior according to family status (presence or absence of young) and heterogeneity in site fidelity may explain the dependence in sighting probabilities; failure to account for this may lead to biased survival estimates. Monthly survival rates from spring to summer (3-mo period) and summer to autumn (2.5-mo period) were equal (0.989 +/- 0.003, mean +/- SE) and showed little variation over the years., even though the two lengthy migratory flights (3000 krn each) and breeding occurred during these periods. In contrast, monthly winter survival (from autumn to spring, 6.5 mo) was lower than during the other seasons and varied significantly over the years (range 0.936 +/- 0.021 to 0.993 +/- 0.008). Mean survival of adult females (corrected for neck band loss) was 0.96 from spring to autumn, 0.86 during winter, and 0.83 +/- 0.05 for the whole year. Natural mortality (i.e., excluding hunting) was equal among seasons and did not vary over the years, which suggests that mortality risk is not increased during migration or reproduction. There was a significant inverse relationship between winter survival and the kill rate (b = - 1.21 +/- 0.56), which suggests that hunting mortality was additive to natural mortality. This is probably a general feature of long-lived species because their low and relatively constant natural mortality rate does not allow them to compensate for an additional source of mortality such as hunting. Contrary to life-history theory, we did not find evidence that migration or reproduction entailed a survival cost in this long-distance migrant bird.

AB Declining nest success of forest birds in fragmented habitat has been attributed to increased nest predation. Better understanding of this problem and potential solutions to it require information on why nest predators are attracted to habitat edges. Toward this end we investigated habitat use by black rat snakes (Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta), an important avian-nest predator in eastern deciduous forests. We radio-tracked 52 black rat snakes for periods of 3-41 mo from 1996 to 1999. All black rat snakes exhibited a strong preference for edge habitats. Consistent with edges being used because they facilitate thermoregulation, gravid females associated more strongly with edges than did males and nongravid females, and sites used by snakes when shedding were significantly associated with habitat edges. Gravid females lost an average of > 20% of their body mass, while nongravid females and males did not lose mass, suggesting that edges were not used because they offered high success in foraging. Similarly, an increase in use of edge habitat through the season by all rat snakes was inconsistent with the snakes being attracted principally to hunt: avian prey would have been more abundant in spring when birds were breeding, and the density of small mammals in edges did not vary seasonally. Also, snakes moved longer distances and were found traveling more often when located in forests. Because our results collectively are most consistent with the hypothesis that rat snakes use edges for thermoregulatory reasons, the negative impact of the snakes on nesting birds may be coincidental; the snakes primarily use edges for reasons other than foraging but opportunistically exploit prey they encounter there. Rat snakes appeared to respond to the edge structure rather than to how the edge was created (natural vs. artificial). Thus, fragmentation of forests by humans has created habitat structurally similar to that preferred by rat snakes in their natural habitat, thereby inadvertently increasing contact between the snakes and nesting birds.

AB Identifying factors that influence variation in light availability within forested ecosystems represents an important component in our understanding of the complex determinants of tree seedling regeneration. We assessed the influence of forest structure and canopy tree architecture on spatial heterogeneity of understory light availability in three old-growth and three second-growth forests in lowland Costa Rica. Forest structure and understory light availability were measured within forest types using contiguous 10 x 10 in quadrats along three 130-160 m transects in each stand. Two 20 x 60 m plots in each forest type were sampled more intensively, including vertical profiles of light availability from 1 to 9 in height. Mean diffuse light transmittance increased from 2% at 1 in height to over 10% at 9 in height and did not differ significantly between forest types at any height. However, the relationships among height classes differed between forest types. Second-growth plots showed a negative spatial autocorrelation for light measurements separated by vertical distances over 4 m. Differences in the vertical distribution of light and foliage suggest that old-growth and second-growth stands differ in vertical organization of the vegetation. The most pronounced structural differences between forest types were found in trees between 10 and 25 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh). In second-growth stands, trees in the 10-25 cin dbh size class were more abundant and differed in allometry. They were taller for a given stein diameter and had narrower crowns for a given height than old-growth trees. Within forest types, we did not find strong relationships between measures of forest structure and light availability, although the strength of these relationships differed between forest types. In both old- and second-growth forest, understory light availability at 0.75 in decreased with increased sapling and shrub density, but was not significantly influenced by local tree density or basal area. From 1-m to 9-m heights, tree density was a significant, but weak, predictor of light availability in old-growth plots. In second-growth plots, tree density showed little or no influence on light availability at heights below 9 m. Our findings challenge the view that, within a forest, canopy and subcanopy vegetation directly influence light transmittance near the forest floor. Instead, we argue that spatial patterning of the light environment occurs through complex interactions among canopy, subcanopy, and understory vegetation.

AB Multiple processes typically influence patterns of abundance. Despite this widely accepted view, many studies continue to approach ecological questions from a single-factor, or, at most. a two-factor perspective. Here, I evaluate the consequences of considering, separately and jointly, the effects of three factors (larval settlement, reef resources, and postsettlement losses) on spatial patterns of abundance of a marine reef fish, the six bar wrasse (Thalassoma hardwicke). Using correlational methods commonly employed in single-factor studies. I show that local patterns of abundance of juvenile wrasse could be attributed entirely to either (1) patterns of abundance of settlement habitat, or (2) patterns of larval settlement. This result occurred because habitat and presumed larval delivery covaried in space. I manipulated abundance of settlement habitat in a field experiment to uncouple this covariation and found subsequent settlement to be simultaneously influenced by both factors. However. joint effects of habitat and settlement failed to account for patterns of abundance of juvenile wrasse without also considering a third factor-postsettlement losses-which were density-dependent and substantially modified patterns of settlement. These results illustrate (1) how multifactorial explanations may be falsely refuted when incomplete sets of multiple factors are considered, and (2) how single-factor explanations may misrepresent underlying multifactorial causation of ecological patterns. Uncovering the interactive role of multiple factors in determining ecological patterns of interest requires a shift from single-factor approaches to more pluralistic perspectives.

AB Rates of propagule supply can be important determinants of spatial and temporal patterns in community structure. In the northeast Pacific Ocean. large-scale differences in the structure of intertidal invertebrate communities have been attributed to a latitudinal gradient in recruitment in this region. To determine whether such a gradient exists, recruitment of intertidal barnacles and mussels was monitored at 17 sites across this region in 1996 and 1997. A latitudinal gradient in recruitment was detected in this study. This gradient was approximately a stepcline: annual recruitment, on average, was 1-2 orders of magnitude higher in central and northern Oregon than in central and northern California. In contrast to the regional differences, large-scale gradients in recruitment within California were small; correlations of recruitment with latitude were weak, and in all but one case, statistically insignificant. Nonetheless, trends in the data suggest that recruitment within central and northern California was highest between San Francisco and Monterey Bay, where larvae may be retained more nearshore than to the north or south. If so, apparently conflicting claims about latitudinal gradients in recruitment within California can be reconciled. The large-scale transition in recruitment rates supports the hypothesis that a marked shift in the intensity of upwelling near Cape Blanco in southern Oregon is a major cause of a coincident transition in community structure. Stronger upwelling (and thus offshore flow) to the south has been hypothesized to transport larvae further offshore and thereby reduce larval supply to nearshore benthic communities.
   This study confirms that the predicted differences in recruitment exist, and that these differences are large. Preliminary calculations indicate that regional differences in offshore flow are likely to make a larger contribution to the recruitment transitions than several other plausible causes. In addition, recruitment transitions are larger, more abrupt, and more consistent across species than corresponding shifts in percentage cover, which favor competitive dominants. This supports model predictions that competition for space is more intense where recruitment is high. However, the absence of strong, large-scale recruitment gradients within California suggests that mesoscale processes are relatively more important than latitudinal trends in upwelling as determinants of community structure patterns at smaller scales.

AB Although clonal organisms dominate many habitats, relatively little is known about their demography in comparison to the more familiar unitary species commonly studied by ecologists. While studies of the population dynamics of clonal species are becoming more common, and methods have recently been developed to examine their demography in more detail, there have been few attempts to calculate such parameters as survivorship and expected remaining life-span (ERL) of ramets for these species. I use published stage-class transition probability matrices to compare the demography of clonal and aclonal species. Clonal species tend to have an increase in their ERL as they increase in size. whereas most aclonal species have a peak in ERL at intermediate sizes which decreases for larger individuals. These patterns indicate that, while aclonal species tend to experience senescence, it is less common for clonal species even at the ramet level. Patterns in genet survivorship are less distinct, with type III survivorship predominating for clonal species, but also being common for aclonal species. Many aclonal species have a "mixed" survivorship curve, which starts out as type III. but becomes type I later in life, indicating high juvenile mortality followed by low adult mortality and eventually senescence. In general, type III survivorship was associated with an increasing ERL, type II with a constant ERL. and mixed with a peaked ERL. The only species with a typical type I survivorship curve was aclonal and had a mixed ERL, first decreasing and then reaching a peak before declining again.

AB This study links offspring size and energetic content to offspring performance (measured as growth and survivorship) in the intertidal gastropod Nucella ostrina and examines the effect of hatching size on performance at different times of year and in contrasting environments. The relationships between individual hatchling size and organic content were compared both within and among clutches of N. ostrina. Hatchling size was positively, significantly, and predictively correlated with hatchling organic content both within and among clutches, demonstrating that hatching size could be reliably used as an indicator of maternal investment. The slope of the relationship between hatchling size and organic content varied between clutches, suggesting intrapopulation variation in embryonic growth geometry. In field outplants, hatching size always had a positive and significant effect on growth, and small hatchlings took approximately one month to reach the initial size of their larger siblings. More large hatchlings than small hatchlings were recovered in every experimental outplant. The: effect of hatching size on recovery was not significant in short (9 d) outplants, but recovery of large hatchlings was significantly greater than recovery of small hatchlings in two out of three long-term (36 or 54 d) outplants. Overall recovery was lower in the summer, the long-term outplant in which size did not significantly affect recovery. In experiments testing the relationship between hatching size and survivorship in two environments that differed in degree of sun exposure, size significantly and positively affected recovery in the more shaded habitat (with higher overall recovery) but not in the sun-exposed environment. Thus, larger hatching size in N. ostrina results in (1) increased hatchling growth, (2) considerably shortened time to maturity, and (3) higher survivorship. However, the advantage of large hatching size was decreased under more severe environmental conditions, those which resulted in higher overall hatchling mortality. Contrary to predictions, poor environmental conditions may not be more likely to select for large off spring size in intertidal habitats: during periods of high heat stress, mortality may be largely random with respect to size.

AB Population responses to variable environments can result from individual behavior (i.e., dispersal and habitat selection) or demography (i.e., changes in birth and death rates). Distinguishing behavioral from demographic responses to environmental variability has important implications for interpretation of spatial patterns and projections of population persistence. I studied the behavioral and demographic responses of tungara frogs, Physalaemus pustulosus, to experimental variation in the density of breeding ponds over two years. At natural spatiotemporal scales of variation in pond density, behavioral responses predominated over demographic responses. In the first year of the experiment, when plots varied in pond density, tungara frogs were proportionally more abundant in plots that contained higher densities of ponds. This behavioral response appeared to be due to increased ability to find plots with high pond densities and reduced effects of pond saturation (i.e., availability of unused ponds) within these plots. In the second year of the experiment, when plots had equal pond densities, there was a detectable demographic response to breeding-pond density early in the season, with fewer frogs in plots that had contained no ponds in the previous year. This response was short-lived, however, and by the end of the second year there was no detectable demographic effect. These results demonstrate that behavioral responses may predominate over demographic responses even on relatively large scales. Thus, studies demonstrating changes in patterns of abundance and distribution must be cautious in interpreting these results in the context of metapopulation dynamics without a detailed understanding of species-specific dispersal behavior.

AB Nutritional deficiencies are a very common phenomenon, and consumers generally face food that is not optimally suited for their needs. Especially herbivores are habitually confronted with food of inferior quality, usually a result of too-low nutrient concentrations in plant material. Waterfleas of the genus Daphnia are good model organisms to study the effect of inferior quality food, and how animals deal with this. We tested the effect of algae to which we had given different phosphorus contents on both life history and feeding parameters of Daphnia magna. Phosphorus content of the algae strongly affected both the growth rate and the feeding activity of the daphniids. Feeding activity increased with declining food quality (increase in C:P ratio of the algae), whereas growth rates were maximal at intermediate C:P levels. We conclude that the direct limitation of phosphorus is a very important factor determining food quality for zooplankters. Daphniids counterbalanced lower P content of their food by spending more C (energy) on acquiring this limiting resource. This implies that when Daphnia are given phosphorus-limited food both the addition of phosphorus and the addition of carbon (energy) should increase the growth rate of the animals (co-limitation). The influence of the phosphorus content of the food on the feeding activity of Daphnia offers a mechanistic explanation for the observed homeostasis in daphniids.

AB The optimum of a species on a gradient is an important parameter for ecological interpretation and bioindication. The location of the optimum is easily estimated in the popular Gaussian response model, but it is more difficult to assess the precision of the estimated optima. Methods based on the profile likelihood or quasilikelihood function are presented to find confidence intervals for the optimum parameter of the Gaussian response function using generalized linear models. The following four cases are considered: optimum on one gradient; optimum on one gradient when there are additional stratifying variables; optimum on an interesting gradient at a certain level of a stratifying variable when the optimum is dependent on the latter; and simultaneous confidence region for the joint overall optimum on two gradients. The methods are illustrated with two species of testate amoebae (Protozoa: Rhizopoda) in Finnish mires. The first two cases were also analyzed using Fieller's theorem, although it produced generally wider limits.

AB Gender in flowering plants is governed by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. The perennial aquatic herb Sagittaria latifolia displays remarkable variation within and among populations in gender expression, from monoecious populations composed of plants with differing numbers of female and male flowers to completely dioecious populations with separate female and male plants. Here we examine the role of environmental factors in modifying gender expression in these two sexual systems by investigating the relation between ramet size and flower number in three sex phenotypes (hermaphrodite, female, and male). In particular, we assess the extent to which hermaphroditic plants have the option of altering the number of female and male flowers to accommodate their specific environmental circumstances. We sampled 12 populations from diverse wetland habitats in southern Ontario, Canada, estimated their phenotypic gender, and examined the relations between ramet size and a range of vegetative and floral traits. On average, plants from dioecious and monoecious populations did not differ in leaf length, a correlate of ramet size. However, in monoecious populations with significant numbers of both male and hermaphroditic ramets, hermaphrodites were larger and produced more flowers than males. This contrasting pattern was also observed when plants were grown under glasshouse conditions. In monoecious populations, variation in ramet size did not affect the production of male flowers, whereas female flower production varied positively with plant size. These relations enabled statistical prediction of the dependence of gender on plant size and the frequency distribution of gender within monoecious populations. These relations also imply that the male phenotype can be determined environmentally, whereas the female phenotype cannot. The size dependence of floral sex ratios in monoecious populations provides novel insights into the likely evolutionary pathway by which dioecy has evolved from monoecy in Sagittaria.

AB Savanna trees influence water, light, and nutrient availability under their canopies, but the relative importance of these resources to understory plants is not well understood. In a three-year study in a Texas savanna, trees infected with the disease oak wilt were used in a natural experiment to isolate the effects of light and soil resources, particularly water, in oak-understory interactions. Herbaceous biomass and survival of transplanted Prosopis glandulosa (mesquite) seedlings were monitored in plots under healthy and symptomatic Quercus fusiformis (live oak) trees. and in open sites. Shade cloth maintained similar midday light levels in plots under symptomatic and healthy trees. Plant physiological attributes, soil parameters, and woody plant densities were also compared across habitats. Water availability was significantly lower near healthy trees than near symptomatic trees or in the open. Shade-cloth plots under symptomatic trees had over twice the herbaceous biomass of ambient-light plots under healthy trees. As shade-symptomatic plots had similar light and lower nutrient levels than ambient-healthy plots, greater water availability under symptomatic trees, was probably a major factor increasing herbaceous productivity. Shade also affected herb growth, and its importance varied seasonally and annually with water availability. Woody seedling densities and 1996 mesquite transplant survival were significantly higher under trees than in the open, indicating facilitation of young woody plants by oaks. However, lower water potentials in larger shrubs near healthy trees and similar shrub densities across habitats (in contrast to seedling densities) suggested that oaks may compete with other woody species as the latter plants age. Our data indicate that both facilitation and competition, have important roles in this savanna community, and competition for water may be a key mechanism in oak-understory interactions.

AB We conducted a neighbor removal experiment in natural alpine plant communities of the southwestern Alps to test for the relative importance of competitive and facilitative interactions along elevational and topographical gradients. The experimental sites were chosen to encompass most of the floristic diversity observed along gradients of elevation and topography, which are the two main ecological gradients associated with alpine plant communities in the western Alps. The effects of neighbor removal on the survival, aboveground biomass, and reproduction of five target species were tested at each of six experimental sites. Using biomass data, we calculated relative competitive index (RCI) and log response ratio (LRR) as measures of interaction strength and direction. We found highly significant shifts from strong competitive effects in low and sheltered sites to strong facilitative responses in high and exposed sites. When experimental results were integrated with gradient analyses, we found that the responses of particular alpine plant species to neighbor removal generally depended on the species' position on elevational and topographical gradients. When neighbors were removed from around target species at experimental sites that were lower in elevation than the distributional mean of the target species, biomass generally increased. When neighbors were removed from around target species at experimental sites that were higher in elevation than the distributional mean of the target species, biomass decreased. In other words, facilitation appeared to allow species from lower elevations to move up the gradient, but competition at low elevations appeared to restrict species from higher elevations from moving down the gradient. In high and exposed sites, experimental evidence for facilitation was coupled to small-scale spatial associations among species, but spatial disassociation was not coupled to experimental evidence for competition at any sites. We conclude that the distribution and abundance of many species in high-elevation communities of the western Alps appears to be enhanced by neighbors, and that species continua commonly observed along environmental gradients are the result of both negative and positive plant interactions.

AB Plant formations different from any extant today apparently were widespread in North America and Europe during the last deglaciation. produced by the independent biogeographic responses of plant taxa to climate change. Dissimilarity analyses of modern and fossil pollen samples in eastern North America show that the unique plant associations centered around the Great Lakes at 14 000 calendar years before present (yr BP), with high dissimilarities during 17 000-12 000 yr BP The late-glacial fossil pollen assemblages are characterized by (1) high abundances of boreal conifers such as spruce and larch relative to their Holocene values. (2) high abundances of herbaceous types (sedge, sage, and ragweed), (3) high abundances of broad-leaved deciduous types (ash, hornbeam, poplar, hazel. and willow), and (4) the low abundance or absence of pine, alder, and birch. When the fossil pollen samples are assigned to biomes using the affinity score technique, the late Pleistocene pollen samples are assigned to mixed parkland, a biome that is not extant in North America today. The fastest vegetational changes occurred 13 000-11 000 yr BP, when the late Pleistocene vegetation reorganized into the Holocene biomes, which have persisted to today. Simulations by the Community Climate Model, version I (CCM 1), suggest that late-glacial climates were also unlike modern climates. featuring a "hypercontinental" mixture of colder-than-present winters, warmer-than-present summers, and lower-than-present precipitation. Dissimilarity analyses of the pollen data and CCMI simulations for 21 000. 16 000, 14 000, 11 000, and 6000 yr BP show that (1) the temporal and spatial distribution of high dissimilarities in the vegetation (relative to present) coincide with dissimilarities in simulated climate, (2) the timing and spatial distribution of changes in the vegetation and simulated climate also agree, and (3) the largest climatic and vegetational changes follow the peak period of dissimilarity from present. Taken together, these three lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the no-analogue plant associations were in equilibrium with orbital- and millennial-scale climate change. Nonclimatic factors such as low atmospheric CO2 concentrations and the presence of now-extinct megafauna species may have increased the openness of the Pleistocene vegetation, but by themselves cannot explain the observed mixture of boreal, temperate, and herbaceous taxa in the no-analogue pollen assemblages, nor can they explain the prevalence of no-analogue pollen samples during the late glacial period.

AB Large herbivores are known to respond to spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of forage resources, but how important herbivores are in creating those spatial patterns, how their influence may be scale dependent, and how herbivore-induced patterns affect ecosystem processes remain unclear. We examined the effects of native migratory ungulates on the spatial distribution of soil nitrogen and N-mineralization potential at scales ranging from 0.1-30 m in grasslands of Yellowstone National Park using geostatistical analyses of soils collected inside and outside long-term (36+-yr) exclosures.
   At small spatial scales (0.1-2 m), ungrazed grasslands showed a high degree of patchiness in the distribution of soil N and N-mineralization potential (94% and 77% of sample variation explained by small-scale patchiness, respectively). For both variables, patches occurred at a consistent mean size of similar to 40 cm. In contrast, grazed grassland exhibited minimal spatial structure in the distribution of soil N and N-mineralization rates (< 24% of variation for both variables spatially dependent) and no consistent patch size at a scale of 0.1-2 m. In grazed grassland, most variation was extremely fine grained, occurring across distances < 10 cm. The high degree of fine-grained heterogeneity in grazed grassland was associated with greater plant diversity in small (20 x 20 cm) patches. Recycling of nitrogen through dung and urine is clearly important for maintaining long-term nitrogen balance of the system, but we estimated that only 2.5% of the grazed grassland sampled was recently affected by urine. Results conflict with predictions of increased heterogeneity in grazed communities based primarily on the deposition of dung and urine in discrete patches and suggest that the dominant mechanism(s) by which grazers alter N cycling in this ecosystem operates through the plant community. We hypothesize that grazers promote fine-scale heterogeneity by diversifying plant species effects on soils and/or increasing the spatial variability in plant litter inputs.
   At larger spatial scales (5-30 m), large herbivores altered the distribution of soil N across a topographic gradient. In a grazed community, soil N properties were associated with the topographic gradient and exhibited increasing variance among sampling points separated by increasing distances from 5 to 30 m. Ungrazed grassland exhibited no spatial structure in soil N distribution and no correlation with topography. Collectively, our data show that grazers influence the distribution of soil N properties at every spatial scale from individual plants to landscapes.

AB Fifteen years of N and P fertilizer addition to an Alaskan moist tundra increased aboveground biomass and primary production by 2.5 times. Species composition of the fertilized vegetation also changed dramatically, from a mix of graminoid, evergreen, deciduous, and moss species to strong dominance by a single, deciduous shrub species, Betula nana. Analysis of these simultaneous changes allows insights into the interactions between changes in resource availability and changes in species composition in regulating vegetation biomass, production, and element use.
   By the 15th year (1995), both new leaf production and total leaf mass were lower in fertilized than in control plots, although leaf area in fertilized plots was twice that of controls. This occurred because Betula produced thinner leaves than other species, with a high specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area per unit leaf mass). Woody stem mass also increased dramatically in fertilized plots, with secondary growth accounting for over half of aboveground net primary production, NPP. The large increase in wood production was made possible, in part, by the low cost of production of Betula's thin leaves, allowing greater allocation to secondary growth. Wood also had lower N concentrations than leaves, allowing large accumulations of wood at low N cost. Overall, aboveground N concentration in Betula did not change in fertilized relative to control plots, because its low-N wood mass increased more than its high-N leaf mass (with high SLA). Because Betula was so strongly dominant an the fertilized plots and was better able to dilute its greater N supply with new growth, community production and biomass in fertilized plots were higher, and N concentration was lower, than would have been the case if species composition had not changed.
   Aboveground biomass and leaf area of individual species and functional types were predicted accurately by regression against the number of hits per point-frame pin across the full range of data, including both treatments. Changes in overall canopy structure and leaf display due to fertilization were thus due mainly to changes in species composition, with no detectable effect of treatment on size/structure relationships within species or functional types.

AB Competition is an important interaction in ecology, and many experiments have been done to examine the effects of intraspecific and interspecific competition. Unfortunately, most of these experiments have been done using either substitution or additive experimental designs. Substitution designs, and to a lesser extent additive designs, severely limit the useful inferences that ecologists can draw from the resulting data. Response surface experimental designs, which vary the densities of two competing species independently, offer the advantage of being able to compare the fits of alternative competition models and to estimate model parameters. This kind of experimental design has been relatively little used in ecology to date. I consider the use of response surface designs from two perspectives. The first is the optimal allocation of experimental effort among density treatments, with the goal of distinguishing among alternative models. Second, I compare the ability of six response surface designs to estimate known competition coefficients correctly, using simulated data. Low densities and densities near equilibrium in one generation tend to return similar densities the following generation and thus provide little or no information for comparing alternative population models. Experimental designs that span a wide range of densities, including high densities above carrying capacities, provide more accurate parameter estimates in general, but low densities are helpful for estimating population growth rates. Designs that are not fully factorial are one compromise solution that can yield accurate parameter estimates for models and yet require less experimental effort than full factorial surfaces. In general, response surfaces are a powerful class of experimental design and offer potentially stronger connections between empirical and theoretical approaches than traditional experimental designs.

AB We investigated the role of abiotic factors in controlling patterns of longterm windthrow in the pristine coastal temperate rain forests of southeast Alaska. Our objectives were to test the extent to which long-term patterns of windthrow can be predicted spatially at the landscape scale by using four abiotic factors (slope, elevation, soil stability, and exposure to prevailing storm winds), evaluate landform influence on windthrow, and compare stand age and structural characteristics in areas prone to and protected from windthrow. On Kuiu Island, southeast Alaska, we used field validation photo-interpretation procedures to identify forest patches likely to be of windthrow origin. A spatially explicit logistic model was then built from the windthrow data and other GIS data layers, based on slope, elevation, soil type, and exposure to prevailing storm winds. Landform influence on patterns of windthrow was examined by evaluating correct model classification by landform type. The model was cross-validated by extrapolating the Kuiu model coefficients to nearby Zarembo Island, and comparing model predictions to an independent large-scale windthrow data set. The model correctly classified 72% of both windthrown and non-windthrown forest. Field data collected in areas most and least prone to windthrow on Kuiu suggest that structural and age characteristics, as well as forest development stages, vary with the probability of windthrow across the landscape. We conclude that small-scale (partial-canopy) disturbance processes predominate in areas least prone to windthrow, and that large-scale stand-replacement disturbance processes predominate in areas most prone to windthrow. Our work suggests that a spatially predictable long-term wind-damage gradient exists on Kuiu Island. Before this research, gap-phase disturbances have been emphasized as the dominant disturbance process controlling forest dynamics in North American coastal temperate rain forests. We conclude that there is less naturally occurring old-growth forest regulated by gap-phase succession than previously believed, and that catastrophic windthrow is an important process driving forest development in southeast Alaska. To date, most timber harvest on Kuiu Island has been concentrated in storm-protected areas where gap-phase processes (old-growth forests) predominated future management activities could,ap se processes (old be tailored to consider long-term natural disturbance patterns to better maintain historical ecosystem function.

AB Three common sampling methods for spatial data are simple random sampling (SRS), systematic sampling (Syst), and stratified random sampling (Strat). When values are spatially correlated, SRS usually leads to estimates having higher variances than with the other two methods. However, the SRS-based variance can be "design-based," using hypothetical repetitions of the sampling process: it needs no assumptions about the unobserved values. Syst and Strat methods do need "model-based" assumptions. As a result, variances of estimates based on Syst or Strat are often estimated by the SRS formula, e.g., s(2)/n for the variance of a mean.
   In a previous paper, we showed that these estimates are misleading, and we described another way to obtain improved estimates. It assumes that the pattern being sampled arose from a random process and considers the expected squared error, E([estimate - parameter](2)), that would arise if this process were run repeatedly and sampled at the same places each time. The unconditional variance uses all such hypothetical runs of the process.
   This paper extends the previous one to a conditional variance; it uses only those hypothetical runs whose values at the sampled points are the same as those in the actual sample. We show that the conditional variance is more reliable and that the other two overestimate uncertainty, often greatly. We calculate confidence and prediction intervals of the mean from the unconditional and the conditional variances. Intervals based on the conditional variance are usually shorter, and they better describe the true uncertainty. We illustrate the methods by case studies on three populations: one using data on the spatial population of acorns under an isolated oak, and the other two simulated. We emphasize that, although our approach applies to any two-dimensional sample, model-based inference requires that the sample be sufficiently representative of the population and that the probabilistic spatial model be specified with caution.

AB In this paper, we report on a whole-pool manipulation of leaf litter decomposition in a tropical stream following a hurricane. The study was designed to distinguish how decapod species comprising two functional feeding guilds alter rates and magnitudes of leaf litter processing and nutrient release linking the detrital food web with the overall producer-consumer food web. Streams of the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico, are dominated numerically by two freshwater shrimp species (Atya lanipes and Xiphocaris elongata). To determine how these shrimp affected detrital processing following large leaf inputs associated with a hurricane, we manipulated the presence or absence of two species of shrimp in six fenced pools of a headwater stream with hurricane levels of Cecropia leaf litter over a 23-d period. The experiment was designed to determine how the two different shrimp affected: (1) the rate and amount of size fractionation of leaf material; (2) the localized nutrient concentrations in the pools; and (3) the rate of particulate export from the pools. Both shrimp species influenced detrital processing, but in fundamentally different ways. Xiphocaris shred intact, large leaves and converted them into fine, medium, and coarse particulates. Through this conversion process Xiphocaris increased the concentration and rate of downstream transport of suspended particulate organic matter. Xiphocaris also significantly increased the concentration of both total dissolved nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon, likely by changing the surface area to volume ratio of organic particles. Atya, a scraper/filter feeder, caused a slight increase in rates of leaf breakdown as compared to controls at the end of the experiment but filtered out fine organic particulates, resulting in less downstream export. Both decapod species affected detrital processing, but in fundamentally different ways, illustrating the potential importance guild diversity may have in altering both particulate and nutrient availability to the rest of the food web. In addition, these results suggest that the presence of both feeding guilds can significantly influence ecosystem responses to severe, large-scale disturbance events.

AB The European waterfrog, Rana esculenta, is a hemiclonal hybrid that must coexist with the parental species Rana lessonae in order to reproduce. It is not clear what allows the two morphologically, genetically, and ecologically similar forms to coexist, but differential success of the hybrid and its sexual host among environments suggests that these frogs may differ in their adaptive abilities, and that ecology plays an important role in determining the relative frequencies of the two related species. The objective of this study was to identify factors that may promote coexistence. We investigated the effect of temperature, food level, and food quality on a variety of life history traits in a laboratory experiment. Our results indicated that tadpoles of the two forms respond differently to temperature. Probability of metamorphosis and survival of R. lessonae were higher at 24 degreesC, while the hybrid, R. esculenta, had a better survival rate and a much larger body mass at metamorphosis at 18 degreesC. We then tested the results of our laboratory experiment by assessing the distribution of the hybridogen and the parental species in natural populations as a function of temperature, and found that the relative frequency of R. esculenta tadpoles declined with increasing temperature. We use these results to evaluate the applicability of the generalist and frozen niche variation models that had been proposed earlier as explanations for the coexistence of the sexual parental species, R. lessonae, and the hybridogen, R. esculenta.

AB Regional processes that regulate the dispersal of a pool of species can influence the number and types of species that are able to integrate into local assemblages. The transgression of glacial lakes to marine fjord environments of the South Island fjords of New Zealand was used to examine the influence of this regional process on local species richness of subtidal, suspension-feeding epifaunal invertebrates. Surveys of epifaunal assemblages over 200 km of coastline, including 23 sites in 13 separate fjords, were used to quantify species density (per 0.25 m(2) quadrat), species turnover along a transect (Routledge's beta (I)), and local species richness (S) with Chao 2 estimations. An extension of the curve of sea level rise over the past 18 000 yr was used to estimate the time at which rising sea levels overtopped the entrance sills of individual fjords, indicating the date at which these habitats were available for colonization. Species density was nonsignificantly related to fjord age, whereas Routledge's beta (I) and local species richness (S) with Chao 2 estimations were all significantly related to fjord age, with fjord age explaining 26%, 58%, and 62% of the variation across the region, respectively. These results indicate that regional constraints on the dispersal of a pool of species can have a strong influence on the local species richness, whereas variations at the quadrat level are likely to be explained by processes operating on smaller spatial scales. The regulation of species integration into local environments by regional processes may also affect the outcome of local processes that depend upon the number and type of species coexisting in local assemblages, underscoring the need to consider historical factors in understanding the structure and function of ecological communities.

AB This study examined the effects of long-term insect herbivory on the response of sand dune willow, Salix cordata, to sand accretion. Plants were either exposed to insect herbivory (by a specialist flea beetle, Altica subplicata) or protected from insect herbivory with cages for three years. Plant growth and mortality, as well as sand levels, were then assessed for the next four years, during which time natural sand accretion occurred. The goal was to examine how growth and mortality were affected by past herbivory and sand accretion, and most importantly, whether these two factors interacted to affect plant performance. There was a highly significant positive correlation between mortality rate and amount of sand accretion. Plants with past herbivory had significantly greater mortality rates than plants with no past herbivory, but this difference resulted from a plant size effect. Shorter plants were more susceptible to mortality from sand burial, and plants with past herbivory were significantly shorter than plants without past herbivory.
   Past herbivory stimulated both stem diameter and height growth over the entire study. The stem diameter growth response to sand accretion varied strongly for plants with and without past herbivory, and the nature of the relationships also varied among dunes. On the west dune, where sand accumulated at a much faster rate, there was a negative relationship between sand accumulation and stem diameter growth, but this relationship was only significant for plants with past herbivory. On the east dune, with a slower sand accumulation rate, stem diameter growth was positively related to sand level for plants with past herbivory, but negatively related to sand level for plants with no past herbivory.
   Past herbivory and sand accretion also affected future susceptibility to herbivory. Beetle densities were significantly greater on plants with no past herbivory than on plants experiencing herbivory three years earlier. For plants with no past herbivory, plants experiencing high amounts of sand had greater beetle densities than plants experiencing low amounts of sand. Thus, this study demonstrated long-term effects of herbivory on increasing plant mortality (indirectly via a decrease in plant size), increasing both stem diameter and height growth of surviving plants, and decreasing future susceptibility to herbivory. Past herbivory also strongly altered the stem diameter growth response of plants to another stress, sand accretion.

AB The C-3-C-4 hypothesis states that plants possessing the C-4 photosynthetic pathway are a poorer food resource for herbivores than those possessing the C-3 pathway, and that this difference is reflected in a tendency for herbivores to avoid feeding on C-4 species. We tested this hypothesis by studying host preference of two oligophagous grass miners, Chromatomyia milli and C. nigra (Diptera: Agromyzidae). Multiple-choice experiments between four C-3 and four C-4 grasses, two-choice experiments between combinations of C-3 and C-4 grasses, and no-choice experiments demonstrated a clear feeding and oviposition preference for C-3 grasses by both miners. Feeding and oviposition were very rare to absent on all C-4 grasses.
   Nutritional-quality analyses showed that water, protein, amino acid, and lignin content did not differ between C-3 and C-4 grasses; only the soluble carbohydrate content proved to be significantly lower in C-3 grasses. We postulated and tested a new explanation for C-4 avoidance, the "physical-constraint hypothesis," which states that physical constraints imposed by a smaller interveinal distance in C-3 grasses may cause C-4 avoidance. Interveinal distances of C-3 grasses were significantly smaller than those of C-4 grasses, and their ranges did not overlap. Several observations strongly suggested that interveinal distance influences feeding and oviposition patterns. Firstly, the ovipositor and eggs of both miners were too wide to fit between two adjacent veins of C-4 grasses. Secondly, feeding punctures initiated on C-4 grasses were smaller than on C-3 grasses, and feeding-puncture size was correlated with interveinal distance. Regression analysis showed that feeding and oviposition preference were positively related to interveinal distance but not to carbohydrate content. We conclude that our observations are consistent with the physical-constraint hypothesis rather than the nutritional-quality hypothesis.

AB Improved understanding of tree growth responses to climate is needed to model and predict forest ecosystem responses to current and future climatic variability. We used dendroecological methods to study the effects of climatic variability on radial growth of a subalpine conifer, mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana). Tree-ring chronologies were developed for 31 sites. spanning the latitudinal and elevational ranges of mountain hemlock in the Pacific Northwest. Factor analysis was used to identify common patterns of interannual growth variability among the chronologies, and correlation and regression analyses were used to identify climatic factors associated with that variability.
   Factor analysis identified three common growth patterns, representing groups of sites with different climate-growth relationships. At high-elevation and midrange sites in Washington and northern Oregon. growth was negatively correlated with spring snowpack depth, and positively correlated with growth-year summer temperature and the winter Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (PDO). In southern Oregon, growth was negatively correlated with spring snowpack depth and previous summer temperature, and positively correlated with previous summer precipitation. At the low-elevation sites. growth was mostly insensitive to annual climatic variability but displayed sensitivity to decadal variability in the PDO opposite to that found at high-elevation sites.
   Mountain hemlock growth appears to be limited by late snowmelt. short growing seasons. and coot summer temperatures throughout much of its range in the Pacific Northwest. Earlier snowmelt. higher summer temperatures. and lower summer precipitation in southern Oregon produce conditions under which growth is limited by summer temperature and/or soil water availability.
   Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations could produce warmer temperatures and reduced snowpack depths in the next century. Such changes would likely increase mountain hemlock growth and productivity throughout much of its range in Washington and northern Oregon. Increased summer drought stress and reduced productivity would be likely, however. in mountain hemlock forests of southern Oregon and near the species lower elevation limit at some sites.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi colonize roots of terrestrial plants and have been hypothesized to reduce susceptibility or to improve the vigor of hosts challenged by root pathogens. Meta-analysis was used to test whether a broad pattern exists in which AM fungi not only enhance plant growth but fundamentally alter plant-pathogen interactions. Data were gathered from studies published between 1970 and early 1998. In these studies nonmycorrhizal or mycorrhizal plants were untreated or challenged with root-infecting fungal pathogens or nematodes. Effect sizes for AM fungus treatment, pathogen treatment, and their interaction were calculated based on measures of average plant growth, pathogen growth. or AM colonization as reported by authors. AM fungus had a very large positive effect, and pathogens had a very large negative effect on plant growth, However, the interaction of AM fungi and pathogen depended upon the class of pathogen. AM fungi tended to decrease the harmful effects of fungal pathogens but to exacerbate the harmful effects of nematodes.
   Overall, inoculation with AM fungi had a large negative effect on growth of pathogens, but the outcome for nematodes depended upon mode of feeding. AM fungi harmed sedentary endoparasitic nematodes. AM fungi improved growth of migratory endoparasitic nematodes, but this outcome was not significant in an analysis limited to independent experiments. Reduced growth of pathogens in mycorrhizal plants may indicate increased host resistance. Alternatively, reduced AM colonization in pathogen-treated plants may suggest that root-infecting organisms compete for resources.
   Some experiments that did not meet criteria for meta-analysis were analyzed with chi (2) tests by calculating the proportion of experiments in which authors reported a significant pathogen effect in the absence vs. presence of AM fungi. AM fungi did not alter the effect of fungal pathogens but reduced the proportion of experiments in which nematodes depressed plant growth in a test limited to independent observations. Comparison of frequency distributions of effect sizes suggests that the difference in results for nematodes in the meta-analysis and the chi (2) tests stems from differences in the AM fungus-plant-pathogen systems examined in each approach rather than a statistical artifact.
   AM fungi reduced pathogen growth in similar to 50% of studies included in chi (2) tests, and this effect was similar for fungal vs. nematode pathogens and sedentary vs. migratory nematodes. Fungal pathogens reduced AM fungus growth more frequently than did nematodes. Both AM fungi and pathogens suffered reduced growth in 16% of experiments that assessed reciprocal effects. Reciprocal suppression was more common when the pathogen was a fungus, which may indicate that fungal pathogens are more likely than nematodes to compete with AM fungi.
   Almost all research on the effects of AM fungi on plant-pathogen relations has examined economically important species, in low-phosphorus soil, in greenhouse or microplot culture. Although these analyses revealed general patterns of the effects of AM fungi on plant-pathogen relations. research on a broader range of species over a wider range of environmental conditions is required to determine the domain for which these patterns apply.

AB The effects of ecological history are frequently ignored in attempts to predict community responses to environmental change. In this study, we explored the, possibility that ecological history can cause differences in community responses to perturbation using parallel acidification experiments in three sites with different PH histories in the Northern Highland Lake District of Wisconsin, USA. In Trout Lake, high acid neutralizing capacity had historically buffered changes in pH. In contrast, the two basins of Little Rock Lake (Little Rock-Reference and Little Rock-Treatment) had experienced seasonal fluctuations in pH. Furthermore, the two lake basins were separated with a curtain and Little Rock-Treatment was experimentally acidified in the late 1980s. In each site, we conducted mesocosm experiments to compare zooplankton community dynamics in control (ambient pH) and acidified (pH 4.7) treatments. Zooplankton community responses were strongest in Trout Lake and weakest in Little Rock-Treatment suggesting that ecological history affected responses to acidification. In part, variation in community sensitivity to acidification was driven by differences in species composition. However, the results of a reciprocal transplant experiment indicated that changes in the acid tolerance of populations during past acidification events may make zooplankton communities less sensitive to subsequent pH stress. Our study highlights the role that ecological history may play in community-level responses to environmental change.

AB Much of current habitat-selection theory assumes that individual fitness monotonically declines as a function of density, and that social interactions among settlers are entirely competitive. However, when animals settle at low densities, other fitness distributions (e.g., Allee effects) and positive interactions among settlers (e.g., conspecific cueing) are possible. We developed an individual-based simulation model to explore how habitat selection at low densities is influenced by three factors: (1) the relationship between density and fitness (negative density-dependence vs. Allee distributions), (2) intrinsic habitat quality, and (3) settlement costs. When two habitat patches are identical in quality, Allee and negative density-dependent models differ in two respects: in Allee models, (1) all individuals initially settle in one habitat patch, and (2) some individuals switch habitats as soon as the alternative habitat begins to be colonized. These patterns are accentuated if habitats differ in quality, and in this situation, Allee distributions and differences in habitat quality have comparable effects on settlement patterns. Settlement costs reduce the number of individuals switching habitat patches in Allee models, and if settlement costs decline as a function of density (as in conspecific cueing), settlers aggregate even if fitness declines monotonically with density after settlement is complete. Our results show that many of the patterns currently construed as supporting negative density-dependent habitat-selection models are also predicted by models that incorporate Allee effects or settlement costs and, more generally, suggest new approaches to habitat selection at low population densities.

AB Parasites can have dramatic effects on life-history decisions of hosts such as timing of reproduction, clutch size, and investment in individual offspring, depending on the timing of parasite effects on host fitness. Moreover, parasites may influence the optimum values of important life-history traits such as clutch size and brood size by having different fitness effects for large and for small values. Here, by analyzing data from a Magpie (Pica pica) population sympatric with the Great Spotted Cuckoo (Clamator glandarius), we demonstrated that Magpies laying a large clutch suffer less from parasitism than do those laying a small clutch, because the first have a higher probability of successfully raising some of their own offspring. Therefore, we predicted that (1) Magpie hosts in sympatry with Great Spotted Cuckoos should produce more eggs, and (2) eggs should be smaller than those in areas of allopatry. We also predicted that (3) this change in life history should be directly related to selection pressures by cuckoos, as evidenced from current levels of parasitism and Magpie rejection of cuckoo model eggs. We tested these predictions by comparing the life-history parameters of 15 European host populations that are either sympatric or allopatric with the parasite. In accordance with predictions, we found an increase in clutch size and a decrease in egg volume of Magpies in populations sympatric with the Great Spotted Cuckoo, as compared to allopatric populations, even when statistically controlling for laying date and latitude. By using parasitism rate and experimentally testing the ability of Magpies to recognize and reject mimetic and nonmimetic model eggs, we were able to test prediction 3 in the 15 Magpie populations. Clutch size was positively related to the rejection rate of nonmimetic model eggs, whereas mean egg volume was significantly negatively related to the rejection rate of mimetic model eggs. These findings provide evidence of a strong influence of the parasitic Great Spotted Cuckoo on the life history of its Magpie host.

AB The impact of environmental conditions on the relative importance of competitive and facilitative interactions and their responses to shoot density was studied in four boreal forest bryophytes. Increased density is believed to have both a positive effect, by increasing water retention, and a negative effect, by reducing light availability. Mortality of shoot apices, offshoot production, and rates of biomass increase of both individual shoots and whole colonies were recorded in experimental monospecific, known-density colonies of Dicranum majus, Plagiochila asplenioides, Ptilium crista-castrensis, and Rhyridindelphus loreus under controlled relative humidity (four levels) and irradiance (two levels). A phenomenological model was developed, and predictions were made about the responses to increased density under different humidity and resource (light) levels. Mortality was low, but offshoot production generally decreased with density. The effects of density on growth rates varied among species and environmental conditions. As predicted, in dry environments under the high light level, growth rates of D. majus and R. loreus peaked at an intermediate density at which the positive effects of a close packing of shoots balanced the increased competition for light. In humid or dark environments, the relationships between growth rates and density were mostly monotonic and negative. Growth rates of P. crista-castrensis decreased with density under most environmental conditions, whereas density was not shown to have an effect on growth rates of P. asplenioides. The results show that relatively high light levels, compared to those found in their natural spruce forest habitat, are necessary for aggregation to facilitate growth of these bryophytes. Thus, our results indicate that competition for light, rather than a low water availability, limits the performance of individual shoots in colonies of these bryophytes under a wide range of densities and humidity conditions.

AB The primary source of mineral nutrients for plants is the decomposition of organic matter by soil microbes. Plants are traditionally viewed as largely passive participants in the decomposition process, incapable of directly affecting rates of decomposition significantly and primarily assimilating nutrients unused by the microbial pool. We performed formed a C-13 pulse-chase experiment on a common grazing tolerant grass, Poa pratensis L., of Yellowstone National Park, to follow carbon flow into the soil rhizosphere and microbial biomass and the associated effects on soil N availability and plant N dynamics. Grazing promoted root exudation of carbon, which was quickly assimilated into a burgeoning microbial population in the rhizosphere of clipped plants. Moreover, these facilitating effects of defoliation on rhizospheric processes positively fed back on soil inorganic N pools, plant N uptake, leaf N content, and photosynthesis. Such findings are the first evidence, to our knowledge, that suggest (1) plants are capable of promoting rhizospheric microbial populations to facilitate uptake of a limiting soil resource and (2) that there is a general positive feedback mechanism by which herbivory promotes plant regrowth as well as energy and nutrient flows in grazed landscapes.

AB I examined the degree to which population sizes of North American wintering birds exhibit spatial synchrony (autocorrelation) and local disappearances based on 30 yr of Christmas Bird Counts. The primary goal of these analyses was to determine whether processes expected in metapopulations, including low spatial synchrony, frequent local disappearances, and colonization leading to population rescue, play important roles in species that are not necessarily subdivided into discrete patches. In general, spatial autocorrelation was less than expected based on environmental factors, with only one-third of species significantly spatially autocorrelated between sites up to 100 km apart and only three (1%) spatially autocorrelated on a continental scale. Spatial autocorrelation was significantly lower for primarily aquatic compared to terrestrial species and tended to be higher among small, widely distributed, and relatively abundant species with more northern winter distributions and low relative population variability. Local disappearances (years when no individuals were detected) were also common and tended to last longer in aquatic, migratory species high in the food chain. When controlling for confounding factors, there was a significant positive relationship between spatial synchrony and the length of disappearances among resident species, as expected if population rescue contributes to interspecific variation in these parameters. These results support the hypothesis that processes expected in metapopulations may be important in many resident bird species. They also provide insight as to which species are more vulnerable to global extinction as well as those for which monitoring efforts aimed at detecting large-scale population declines may be performed efficiently by extrapolating from data acquired at relatively few sites.

AB To evaluate the effects of increased air temperature in combination with increased deposition of N and/or S on methane emission. we have raised in situ the temperature and rates of deposition of N and S in a poor fen lawn area of a boreal mixed mire. The experiment was laid out in a factorial design, where the mean daily air temperature 0.3 In above the vegetation surface was increased (by 3.6 degreesC) using greenhouse enclosures. A significant increase in the cover of sedges was observed in the N-supplemented plots after the third year of treatment. All three experimental factors had significant effects on the methane emission. The effects of temperature and N deposition strongly interacted with the sedge cover, which was the single variable explaining most variation in methane emission. Raised temperature affected the emission positively when the sedge cover was high but showed no effect when the sedge cover was low. Nitrogen addition affected methane emission negatively when the sedge cover was high and had a zero or slightly positive effect at low sedge cover. These positive temperature and negative N interaction effects with sedge cover were likely due to changed biomass allocation patterns in the plants. The S additions had negative effects on methane emissions at ambient temperature but no effect at raised temperature. This interaction effect was possibly a result of different retention of S, since the total S concentration was higher in the S addition treatments at normal but not at raised temperature. The results stress the fact that a given variable may affect biogeochemical processes in different directions or to differing degrees depending on other variables. both experimental and natural. Most importantly, the effects of added nitrogen, but also of increased temperature. were critically dependent on the density of sedges.

AB Ecosystem properties of surficial (0-10 cm) soils in remnant herbaceous patches were compared to those of contrasting woody plant patch types (upland discrete cluster, upland grove, and lowland woodland) where shifting land cover is known to have occurred over the past 50-77 yr. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and quantify the biogeochemical consequences and subsequent developmental rates of woody plant formation on sites formerly dominated by grasses.
   Clay and water content of woodland soil patches was higher than that of soils associated with upland discrete cluster and grove patches. Even so, lowland woody patches were generally comparable to upland grove and discrete shrub cluster patches with respect to soil organic carbon (SOC), soil N, the ratio of annual N mineralization: total N, annual litterfall, and root biomass. The fact that finer soil texture, enhanced soil moisture, and the more advanced age of lowland woody patches did not translate into greater accumulations of SOC and N relative to upland grove and discrete cluster patches suggests that C and N losses might be higher in recently developed lowland woodland communities. Fluctuations in monthly root biomass standing crop (0-10 cm) far exceeded annual foliar litterfall in upland and lowland woody patch types. suggesting that belowground inputs of organic matter may drive changes in soil physical and chemical properties that occur subsequent to woody plant establishment.
   The estimated annual mean rates of soil C accretion in the "islands of fertility" that developed subsequent to tree/shrub encroachment were variable and ranged from 8 to 23 g/m(2) (in groves and discrete clusters. respectively); N accretion ranged from 0.9 to 2.0 g/m(2) (in groves and discrete clusters, respectively), even though mean annual N mineralization rates were three- to fivefold greater than those measured in remnant herbaceous patches.
   Woody plant proliferation in grasslands and savannas in recent history has been widely reported around the world. The causes for this shift in vegetation are controversial and center around changes in livestock grazing. fire, climate, and atmospheric CO2. Our data, which are conservative in that they examine only the upper 10 cm of the soil profile. indicate that the rate and extent of soil C and N accumulation associated with this phenomenon can be rapid, substantial, and accompanied by increased N turnover. This geographically extensive vegetation change thus has important implications for understanding how the global carbon and nitrogen cycles may have been altered since Anglo-European settlement of and and semiarid regions.

AB This study examined how long-term insect herbivory, sand accretion, and the interaction of these factors affect patterns of plant succession on sand dunes. Individuals of a common dune species, Salix cordata, were either exposed to insect herbivory (by a specialist flea beetle, Altica subplicata) or protected from insect herbivory with cages from 1990 to 1992. Plant community composition and sand levels were then assessed from 1993 to 1996, during which time natural sand accretion occurred and flea beetles were rare. The goal was to examine how plant species composition and successional patterns were affected by past herbivory on one plant species, sand accretion, and an interaction between past herbivory and sand accretion. Past herbivory on Salix cordata caused a significant decrease in the proportional representation of herbaceous monocots in the plant community, as well as changes in the abundance of four of the 10 most common plant species. Other grasses and Aster/Solidago had greater increases in abundance in plots with past herbivory, Populus tremuloides had lesser decreases in abundance in plots with past herbivory, and Potentilla anserina had greater increases in abundance in plots without past herbivory. Past herbivory did not significantly affect changes in species richness over the study.
   Over the entire study, herbaceous monocots, herbaceous dicots, and horsetails increased in absolute abundance, but woody plant abundance decreased. Sand accretion significantly decreased the changes in abundance of three categories of plants: herbaceous monocots, herbaceous dicots, and woody plants. Only for horsetails was there was a positive relationship between change in abundance and sand accretion. As sand levels increased, the percentage of herbaceous dicots increased, whereas the percentage of herbaceous monocots decreased. There was a greater decrease in species richness with increasing amounts of sand deposition. For eight of the 10 most common species, there was a negative relationship between sand level and change in abundance; only beach grasses responded positively to sand accretion. Plant height was a significant factor in explaining which species increased vs. decreased in abundance; species that increased during the study were significantly taller than species that decreased. Clonal and nonclonal species responded similarly to sand accretion. There were very few interactive effects of past herbivory and sand level. Thus, past herbivory on Salix cordata had direct effects on the future composition of the plant community, via changes in plant abundance, but did not appear to modify the response of the plant community to sand accretion.

AB There is still limited understanding of the processes underlying forest dynamics in the world's tropical rain forests, ecosystems of disproportionate importance in terms of global biogeochemistry and biodiversity. Particularly poorly documented are the nature and time scale of upward height growth during regeneration by the tree species in these communities. In this study, we assessed long-term height growth through ontogeny For a diverse group of canopy and emergent tree species in a lowland neotropical rain forest (the La Selva Biological Station, northeastern Costa Rica). Species were evaluated based on annual height measurements of large samples of individuals in all postseedling size classes, over a 16-yr period (> 11000 increments). The study species were seven nonpioneers (Minquartia guianensis. Lecythis ampla, Hymenolobium mesoamericanum, Simarouba amara, Dipteryx panamensis, Balizia elegans, and Hyeronima alchorneoides) and two pioneers (Cecropia obtusifolia and Cecropia insignis). For each species, inherent height growth capacity was estimated as the mean of the five largest annual height increments (from different individuals) in each juvenile size class (from 50 cm tall to 20 cm in diameter). All species showed marked ontogenetic increases in this measure of height growth potential. At all sizes, there were highly significant differences among species in height growth potential. The two Cecropia species consistently showed the highest observed maximum height increments as smaller juveniles (less than or equal to4 cm in diameter). Among the nonpioneers, Simarouba had the highest growth potential across all juvenile sizes. For all species, mean annual height increments in all juvenile size classes were very much lower than the species' potential growth rates and reflected the impacts of frequent periods of zero growth and major height losses from physical damage. Because of the same factors, maximum net height increments declined over increasing measurement intervals (1-15-yr periods). With only one exception (Simarouba amara saplings less than or equal to1 cm in diameter that survived 10 yr), the annual height growth increments of these species showed no significant temporal autocorrelation. For the seven nonpioneer species, we estimated the minimum time required to grow from 50 cm tall saplings to 10 cm diameter trees, based on their greatest net height increments over increasing intervals. Estimated passage times increased from 7-33 yr, when based on maximum 5-yr height increments, to 37-83 yr, when based on maximum net height growth over 15 yr for the six longest studied (nonpioneer) species. Given the erratic height growth trajectories found for these juvenile trees in this 16-yr study, it is clear that much longer term observation is required. Still unknown are the actual growth trajectories that characterize successful regeneration in each of our focal species, how much time successful trees spend as suppressed juveniles, and the number of times they experience and recover from major physical damage.

AB To determine how grassland, woodland, and bordering forests respond to increased aridity, we used paleoecological methods to examine past responses along a transect of three sites at the eastern boundary of the Northern Plains of North America. Our study region corresponds to the confluence of three air streams that control central North American climates and, hence, should be sensitive to climate change. Sediment cores were analyzed for evidence of Holocene vegetation and fire from tall-grass prairie in eastern North Dakota (Moon Lake), from mixed forest near the prairie border in northwestern Minnesota (Deming Lake), and from mixed forest more remote from prairie in western Wisconsin (Dark Lake). Together with pollen and charcoal analysis, we present a new method for determining delta C-13 of terrestrial (charred) organic matter and, thus, the relative importance of C-3 and C-4 photosynthetic pathways in past vegetation. Paleorecords were supplemented with surface charcoal accumulation and delta C-13 from 21 North American lakes that span boreal, deciduous, pine, and mixed forest to tall- and mixed-grass prairie.
   Surface charcoal and delta C-13 follow vegetation and climate gradients, with high charcoal accumulation and delta C-13 (-20 parts per thousand) in the Plains (Dakotas, Nebraska, and southwest Minnesota) and decreases to the east, west, and north. The delta C-13 pattern is consistent with observed patterns of C-3:C-4 dominance across the region. Sediment, pollen, charcoal, and terrestrial delta C-13 show that vegetation response to climate change varied substantially among tall-grass prairie, bordering woodland, and forest. During maximum aridity (8000-4000 yr BP) prairie vegetation in eastern North Dakota showed a demise of woody vegetation followed by a dfluctuating dominance of grasses (40% C-4) and forbs. Meanwhile, prairie expanded eastward into northwestern Minnesota, where it produced a shifting dominance between mostly C-4 grasses and woody vegetation until more humid conditions and mixed forest developed after 4000 yr BP Mixed forest in southwestern Wisconsin showed little response to mid-Holocene aridity. Elevated delta C-13 values from 5000 to 3000 yr BP suggest that composition of grasses changed (to increased C-4), although pollen data indicate that the total abundance of grasses remained constant. The increase in C-4 grasses at this time is consistent with previous studies suggesting a delayed dry interval in eastern Iowa. Reduced aridity of the last 2000 yr brought increased fire to tall-grass prairie as higher primary productivity led to increased fuel load. Meanwhile, forest expanded in northwestern Minnesota, leading to decreased ignition and fine fuels, in turn resulting in decreased fire at the woodland margin.

AB The consequences of elevated CO2 on plant growth have been well studied on individual plants. The response of a more complex system with several plants interacting is less understood-a situation that limits our capacity to predict the response of natural plant communities. In this study we analyzed the effect of CO2 enrichment on intergenotypic competition in Arabidopsis thaliana. Seeds of five: genotypes collected from different natural populations were used. Each genotype was cultivated in a pure stand and in a mixture with each of the other four genotypes in two CO2 conditions (ambient and elevated). At harvest time, genotype fitness was estimated by the number of fruits and seeds produced per plant. At current levels of CO2, genotypes performed better in a pure stand than in a mixture. Kin selection, associated with the low seed dispersal and autogamous reproductive regime of A. thaliana, is invoked to explain these positive responses among plants of similar genotype. Surprisingly, in a high-CO2 atmosphere (700 muL/L) the reverse situation was observed: plants performed better in mixtures than in pure stands. Positive frequency dependent selection under ambient CO2 concentration became negative under elevated CO2, which could lead more easily to the maintenance of genetic variation. This hypothesis was tested with a simple model of competition. At equilibrium, the simulation did not show coexistence among more genotypes under elevated CO2 than under ambient CO2 concentration. However, this study allows predictions about evolutionary trajectories under high CO2 conditions. In A. thaliana, genotypes that will maintain the most their ability to grow well in pure stand should be selected under increasing CO2.

AB Our understanding of the diversity of mammalian life histories is based almost exclusively on eutherian mammals, in which the slow-fast continuum persists even after controlling for effects of body size and phylogeny. In this paper, we use modern comparative methods to test the extent to which this eutherian-based framework can be extrapolated to metatherian mammals. First, we examine the pattern of covariation among life history traits, and second, we test for correlations between variation in life history and variation in six candidate ecological variables: type of diet, extent of intraspecific competition, risk of juvenile mortality, diurnal pattern of activity, arboreality, and rainfall pattern. Even when controlling for body size and phylogeny, we observe a slow-fast continuum in metatherian mammals. Some parameters involved are different from those identified by studies of eutherians, but the underlying relationships among longevity, fecundity, and age at maturity persist. We also show that overall variation in a key life history variable, reproductive output (measured by annual reproductive rate and litter size), is significantly related to variation in type of diet, with a foliage-rich diet being associated with low fecundity. This is interesting because, although ecological correlations have been found within some eutherian subgroups, modern comparative approaches have failed to reveal robust ecological correlates of overall life history diversity in eutherians.

AB In tallgrass prairie, belowground processes are even more important than in forested systems because aboveground biomass and standing dead litter are periodically removed by frequent fires or grazers. Thus, studies that address factors regulating belowground processes are especially relevant for tallgrass prairie. We predicted that effects of grazing and burning differ belowground and that changes in root productivity caused by burning or grazing provide feedback that affects ecosystem fluxes of C and N. These differences in belowground response should be driven largely by changes in N dynamics and the degree to which burning and grazing affect the pathway and magnitude of N loss and the degree of N limitation in these systems. Fire. the major pathway of N loss in ungrazed tallgrass prairie, should result in reduced net N mineralization and N availability. We expected plants to compensate for increased N limitation by increasing their allocation to roots, as manifested in increased soil respiration and C cycling belowground. In contrast, grazing conserves N in the ecosystem by redistributing the N once contained in grass to labile forms in urine and dung. Thus, we predicted that grazing should increase N cycling rates and N availability to plants. Consequently, grazed plants should be less N limited and should allocate less C to roots and more to shoots. This, in turn, should decrease belowground C cycling, manifested as reduced soil CO2 flux.
   We explored the roles of grazing and burning on root growth in experimental watersheds at Konza Prairie, Kansas, USA. To assess effects of fire on root productivity, we installed root ingrowth cores in two watersheds without grazers that differ in fire frequency: annually vs. infrequently burned (four years since the last fire). To assess effects of grazing, we installed root ingrowth cores in an annually burned watershed grazed by bison and in fenced controls (exclosures). Within bison "grazing lawns," root ingrowth cores were installed in lightly and heavily grazed patches. Concurrently, we measured in situ rates of net N mineralization and soil respiration as indices of soil N and C cycling.
   Annual burning resulted in a 25% increase in root growth compared to the unburned watershed (four years since last fire), as plants compensated for N limitation by increasing allocation to roots. Grazing had the opposite effect: it decreased root growth, especially in heavily grazed patches (similar to 30% less than in fenced controls). Grazing by ungulates increased N cycling and availability. Therefore, grazed plants, instead of being N limited, experienced C limitation as shoots regrew and plants allocated less C to roots. Interestingly, root ingrowth on the long-term unburned watershed was as low as in lightly grazed patches in the grazed watershed. Thus, seemingly disparate treatments such as infrequent burning (characterized by accumulation of detritus aboveground) and grazing (periodic biomass removal) both had higher levels of N availability than annually burned prairie in the absence of grazers. Root growth in unburned and grazed watersheds must be limited by resources other than N (e.g., C in grazing lawns or light in infrequently burned prairie).
   Burning and grazing also altered root tissue chemistry in contrasting ways that further accentuated the root growth differences caused by these treatments. Frequent fires lowered substrate quality of roots (C:N = 60), thus increasing N limitation. In contrast, grazing and infrequent burning improved root tissue quality (C:N = 40), promoting faster cycling of N. These large differences in root growth and tissue chemistry can result in profound ecosystem-level changes. Grazing increased net N mineralization rates from 87% to 617% compared to watersheds without grazers, whereas annual burning decreased it by similar to 50% compared to unburned prairie. Although grazing speeded up N cycling, it reduced soil respiration by 50% compared to fenced controls, presumably because of reduced root mass. On the other hand, annual burning increased soil respiration, presumably because of increased root biomass. Ultimately, differences in the quantity and quality of roots provide feedback to affect C and N cycling and help to maintain and even promote the fundamental differences in N cycling between burning and grazing in tallgrass prairie.

AB Studies from a wide variety of ecosystems indicate that primary producers may protect their environment against degrading processes such as erosion by water current or wind. Theoretical analyses showed that the dynamics of these systems are governed by positive feedback. We investigated the implications of a positive feedback between growth of benthic diatoms and erosion of silt in tidal flat systems. A simple mathematical model shows that alternate stable states may occur in systems with positive feedback between diatom growth and silt accumulation, particularly in sediments with intermediate bottom shear stress. High diatom cover, high silt content, and low levels of erosion characterize one state. The other state is dominated by erosion, and hence both diatom cover and silt content are low. In an experimental study, we tested the critical model assumption that the growth rate of diatoms increases with the silt content of the sediment. Net growth of diatoms was significantly higher on silt than on sandy sediment after nine days of incubation, supporting the premise that diatom-silt interactions are governed by positive feedback. Furthermore, we compared model predictions to data on the physical and biological properties of sediments of a tidal flat. In accordance with our model, the silt content of sediments with intermediate to high bottom shear stress showed a clear and significant bimodal distribution, which may reflect the existence of alternate stable states. At low bottom shear stress, silt content was better explained by a unimodal distribution, as was predicted by our model. Patterns in chlorophyll a content were less clear. Nevertheless, chlorophyll a content was best explained by a bimodal distribution at high bottom shear stress, and in two of the three periods at low bottom shear stress. Our study indicates that the positive feedback between enhanced production of diatoms and decreased erosion of sediment significantly affects the dynamics of intertidal flat systems.

AB Fruits of Viburnum opulus (highbush cranberry. guelder rose) ripen in the fall and remain uneaten throughout the winter months. To investigate the fruiting strategy of this plant, I described the natural history of fruit removal from V. opulus shrubs in central New York and investigated nutritional mechanisms for the phenology of fruit removal by its principal disperser. Viburnum opulus fruit crops were often completely consumed in April and May, almost exclusively by Cedar Waxwings (Bombycilla cedrorum). Sugar solute concentration of V. opulus fruit pulp increased over the winter season through dehydration. When wild Cedar Waxwings were presented with early-season (removed and frozen in December) and remnant late-season (April) fruits, they strongly preferred early-season fruits. This result demonstrated that springtime consumption of V. opulus fruits by Cedar Waxwings is not caused by chemical changes in the fruit pulp during the winter months that enhance fruit palatability.
   Cedar Waxwings often fed intermittently on the male catkins of eastern cottonwoods (Populus deltoides) when eating V. opulus fruits. Feeding experiments with captive waxwings showed that birds lost body mass on either V. opulus fruits or P. deltoides catkins alone, but maintained or gained body mass when offered both foods simultaneously. The combined diet provided Cedar Waxwings with nutritionally sufficient amounts of energy from fruit sugars and protein from pollen. Two chemical characteristics of V. opulus fruits were implicated in creating a short-term demand for supplemental protein: an especially low nitrogen/carbohydrate ratio and secondary compounds. The pulp of V. opulus fruits contains secondary compounds that make this fruit very acidic, presenting consumers with the challenge of maintaining acid/base homeostasis. Elevated nitrogen losses by waxwings eating only V. opulus fruits were consistent with the hypothesis that birds catabolized protein to produce bicarbonate as an acid buffer. Secondary compounds may play a central role in the evolution of plant fruiting syndromes because of their dual effects on microbes, mediating persistence of fruits in the environment, and palatability of fruits to seed dispersers, presumably because they exact a protein cost from consumers.
   These results showed that nutritional interactions of seasonally ephemeral food items can determine temporal patterns of fruit consumption. The well-defended fruits of V. opulus are eaten when more palatable fruits no longer remain and when a complementary protein source becomes available. This fruiting strategy can result in wholesale seed dispersal. The restricted nature of the mutualism between waxwings and V. opulus appears to be a result of the extraordinary persistence of these fruits and the unique dietary habits of waxwings. Viburnum opulus fruits remain uneaten until the spring months, when waxwings are scavenging remnant crops of sugary fruits and most other avian frugivores have switched to animal foods.

Previous field experiments have shown that larvae of Enallagma and Ischnura species are able to coexist in the littoral zones of lakes because they resolve this growth/predation risk trade-off differently: Ischnura species grow more quickly than Enallagma species, but Ischnura, species suffer higher mortality rates than Enallagma. We performed a series of laboratory studies to explore the mechanistic basis for the difference in growth between the genera. When held in complete isolation and with unlimited food, larvae of a number of Enallagma species that coexist with fish accumulated mass at much faster rates than Ischnura species. This difference in isolation was due to the fsh-lake Enallagma simply ingesting more food. In contrast, when held in the presence of other damselflies or a fish predator, Ischnura had significantly higher growth rates than Enallagma species from fish lakes. All species decreased the amount of food they ingested in the presence of the fish predator as compared to when fish were absent, which resulted in decreased growth in the presence of the predator for all species. However, the interspecific differences in growth rate were due primarily to differences in the abilities of the species to convert ingested food into their own biomass; in the presence of fish, comparably sized larvae ingested nearly identical amounts of food, but Ischnura larvae grew faster because they converted significantly more ingested food into their own biomass than did larvae of Enallagma species from fish lakes. This difference in conversion efficiency between the genera was not apparent when larvae were raised in complete isolation. These results indicate that Enallagma and Ischnura species differ in physiological stress responses to the presence of predators, and this difference may facilitate the coexistence of Enallagma and Ischnura species in the field.

AB A central tenet of parental investment theory is that parents should invest more in offspring that are more valuable. Among prairie waterfowl, duckling survival is higher in wetter years. Thus, we tested the prediction that female dabbling ducks should take greater risks protecting their offspring in wetter years. As our measure of risk-taking, we used the distance at which incubating females flushed from nests when approached by an observer. Data were collected for Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Blue-winged Teal (A. discors), and Gadwall (A. strepera) nesting on the same study area in south-central Saskatchewan, Canada, over a 14-yr period during which wetland abundance varied by almost an order of magnitude. Flushing distances of incubating females varied significantly with wetland conditions in all three species, but in a direction opposite to that predicted. Female ducks risked less for their nests in wetter years. These results could not be explained by differences among years in nest initiation dates, renesting potential, clutch size, or age structure of the breeding population. We propose that our counterintuitive results may be a consequence of the way in which wetland abundance affects the cost of reproduction in these ducks. If postbreeding survival of females is higher in wetter years, and increases faster than that of their ducklings as a function of increasing wetland abundance, then the Value of the females to themselves (i.e., future reproduction), relative to the value of their current reproductive attempt, could favor reduced parental investment in wetter years.

AB Movement by stream fish is known to be strongly influenced by abiotic factors such as floods and temperature, but roles of biotic factors, such as predation threat, and interactions of abiotic and biotic factors are less clear. Predation threat is known to fragment populations of killifish, Rivulus hartii, in Trinidad rivers by rendering habitat inhospitable. We asked whether such spatial fragmentation was accompanied by reduced movement by fish in the predator-occupied zone of a river, relative to a zone free of the strong piscivore, Hoplias malabaricus, that causes the fragmentation. We used a 19-mo marking study in a river with a predator barrier, field experiments in the river, and mesocosms to evaluate four hypotheses: (1) the predator reduces prey movement in the river; (2) for the special case of prey leaving refugia, the predator increases movement; (3) movement positively correlates with water level in the predator's presence; and (4) complex physical structure in hazardous habitat promotes prey movement.
   We marked 1467 Rivulus in the natural study areas and had 1015 recaptures. Contrary to Hypothesis 1 but in support of Hypothesis 2, prey showed greater movement along the river in the presence of the predator, regardless of whether the fish resided in a refuge at its previous capture. An experiment with introduced fish confirmed the findings that movement was elevated in the predator's presence. Effects of an abiotic factor (water level, Hypothesis 3) and a phenotypic trait (body size) depended upon whether the predator was present: movement was independent of water level and body size in the absence of the predator, but positively related to both variables in the predator's presence. Emigration from the river to tributaries was also independent of body size in the predator's absence, but positively size-dependent in the predator's presence. Complex physical structure (Hypothesis 4), in the form of cobble added to experimental pools, enhanced the transit of fish through hazardous pools.
   This study shows that spatial fragmentation does not necessarily imply that movement between fragments will be impeded (dynamical fragmentation). Rather, it is possible that movement among spatial fragments may be enhanced by the same factor, predation threat, that produced the spatial fragmentation in the first place. Because of the context-dependent effects of an abiotic factor (water level) and a phenotypic variable (body size) on movement, the study also emphasizes the need to clarify the exact role of predation as an agent promoting or retarding movement, and it suggests a need for incorporating such parameters into models of movement and metapopulation dynamics.

AB Granivorous animals that cache as well as consume seeds may actually serve as mutualists to their plant resources. Seeds of Indian ricegrass (Oryzopsis hymenoides), a perennial bunchgrass in North American deserts, are consumed by various desert granivores and dispersed by seed-caching heteromyid rodents. We used a three-way factorial design at a western Nevada site to selectively exclude or allow access to experimental plots by granivorous rodents and seed harvester ants, and to subsequently follow the fate of radiolabeled Indian ricegrass seeds introduced to the plots. In addition to the presence or absence of rodents or ants, the third experimental treatment factor was to allow "initial caching" of the radiolabeled seeds by single Merriam's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys merriami), which were confined to certain plots for one night. Both rodents and ants larder-hoarded seeds in their burrows, but seedlings rarely established from larders. Only rodents also placed seeds in scatterhoards: shallowly buried surface caches distributed about an animal's home range. Following initial caching by a kangaroo rat, the number of seedlings established from scatterhoards was significantly greater (usually by more than an order of magnitude) than those from seeds unharvested by either type of granivore. With no initial caching, rodents reduced seedling recruitment from unharvested seeds but facilitated compensatory seedling recruitment from scatterhoards. Seeds harvested by ants seldom established seedlings. We used a seed fate model to estimate that, on average, rodents and ants harvested 96% and 7%. respectively, of seeds to which they had exclusive access, and that the probability of seedling establishment for a seed harvested by a rodent was an order of magnitude greater than from a seed harvested by an ant and slightly greater than for an unharvested seed. The predicted rank order of seedling recruitment among nine experimental treatments based on expected effects of rodent seed caching closely matched the observed ranking pattern, indicating that rodents determined seedling recruitment patterns of Indian ricegrass. Because rodents harvested such a large majority of seeds and their caches enhanced seedling establishment., they played a central role in the population dynamics of Indian ricegrass.

AB The microbial benthic community living in streams has a key role in organic-matter processing. The respective role of epilithic biofilms (growing on rocks) and epipsammic biofilms (growing on surficial sandy substrata) in the degradation of organic matter was evaluated in a Mediterranean stream (Riera Major, northeastern Spain). Along with structural variables (algal chlorophyll a, bacterial density), we measured extracellular enzymatic activities (beta -glucosidase, beta -xylosidase, and phosphatase), photosynthetic activity ((HCO3-)-C-14 incorporation) and microbial community respiration (electron-transport-system activity) monthly for one year on different biofilms. Variations of temperature, dissolved oxygen and ammonium influenced the metabolism of sand-colonizing biofilm. However, none of these factors influenced metabolism of the epilithon. which did not follow a clear seasonal pattern. The capacity of microorganisms to degrade polysaccharides differed between the two types of biofilm. Epipsammon had higher beta -glucosidase and beta -xylosidase activities ( 16.4 and 7.4 nmol.cm(-2.)h(-1) in annual average, respectively) than epilithon (6.1 and 3.3 nmol.cm(-2).h(-1) in annual average, respectively), indicating that degradation of cellulosic and hemicellulosic molecules was greater on sand than on tiles. The higher extracellular enzymatic activity in the epipsammon was related, in part, to the accumulation of organic matter in the sediment-suggesting dependence on substrate concentration. Bacterial biomass and cell size were lower on sand, but its biofilm was much more efficient in the utilization of polysaccharidic compounds: the extracellular enzyme activity per cell was up to 60-240 x 10(-10) nmol methylumbelliferyl (MUF) per cell per hour in sand, but only reached maximum values of 4-7 x 10(-10) nmol MUF per cell per hour on rock surrogates. These results emphasize the importance that sand habitats have in processing of organic matter in low-order, forest streams. where biofilms are potentially able to degrade a higher volume of macromolecules (especially polysaccharides) than those in the rocky streambed.

AB Although environmental parental effects, especially maternal effects, are well known in plants we have almost no information about their expression in nature. This study explores the influence of maternal and paternal light and nutrient environments on germination characters under natural conditions in the herbaceous plant Campanula americana. Families were grown in a greenhouse under three levels of light or three levels of nutrients, and crosses were conducted within each environmental gradient to produce seeds with all combinations of maternal and paternal environments. Seeds produced under the controlled environments were planted into the home site of the population and another local site, and germination was monitored over the fall and spring germinating seasons. The paternal light environment influenced percentage germination, demonstrating that the offspring phenotype may depend on the environment a set of pollen donors is grown in. The effect of maternal nutrient level on percentage germination depended on the offspring environment. Percentage germination in response to maternal nutrient and paternal light environments varied among families, suggesting that these parental environmental effects are genetically variable. Both maternal light and nutrient environments influenced season of germination. Germination season determines life history in C americana: fall-germinating individuals are annuals while spring-germinating seeds are biennials. Maternal plants grown under low and high light and low nutrient conditions produced more biennial offspring while the remaining maternal environments had an equal frequency of annual and biennial offspring. In C americana maternal environments influence life history and therefore fitness through their effects on season of germination.

AB Although a great deal of research has focused on the effects of nutrient supply on plant competition, few studies have explored how these processes interact with non-resource factors to determine community-level patterns. This study examined how resource competition interacts with physical stress to structure salt-marsh plant communities across a natural gradient in tidal stress. First, nutrient additions at naturally,occurring species borders at zonal and patch boundaries in two Rhode Island (USA) marshes revealed that competitive outcomes were typically reversed when nutrients were abundant. These results, which are consistent with earlier findings in a third southern New England marsh, suggest that a nutrient-dependent competitive hierarchy is a general characteristic of salt marshes in this region. To test whether these shifts in competitive outcomes occur only at naturally occurring species borders or can lead to more significant shifts in zonation patterns, lower marsh species were transplanted into the matrix of each zonal species at higher tidal elevations, and the outcomes of plant competition in fertilized plots and unfertilized plots were compared. Results of this experiment indicate that nutrient effects on the competitive relations of marsh plants were independent of where the interactions took place along the tidal gradient. The stress-tolerant species were consistently the best competitors in fertilized treatments, showing that an increase in nutrient availability can lead to drastic shifts in the distributions of plants across marshes. Finally, a third experiment examined the interaction between nutrient supply and the aboveground and belowground components of plant competition using a reciprocal transplant design coupled with nutrient-addition and neighbor-removal treatments. Results suggest that. competition is primarily belowground under ambient marsh conditions but is aboveground at high nutrient levels. Thus the mechanism underlying the nutrient-dependent competitive hierarchy, may be driven by a trade-off between belowground and aboveground competitive abilities, although the potential interaction between above- and belowground effects was not examined. Together, the results of these experiments suggest that nutrient supplies may significantly affect the competitive dynamics between salt-marsh perennials and their resultant zonation.. across an environmental gradient in tidal stress. The result that stress tolerators can be dominant competitors is not predicted by any current model of plant competition and must be considered in future empirical and theoretical studies.

AB Understanding the relationship between species richness and productivity is fundamental to the management and preservation of biodiversity. Yet despite years of study and intense theoretical interest, this relationship remains controversial. Here, we, present the results of a literature survey in which we examined the relationship between species richness and productivity in 171 published studies. We extracted the raw data from published tables and graphs and subjected these data to a standardized analysis, using ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression and generalized linear-model (GLIM) regression to test for significant positive, negative, or curvilinear relationships between productivity and species diversity. If the relationship was curvilinear, we tested whether the maximum (or minimum) of the curve occurred within the range of productivity values observed (i.e., was there evidence of a hump?).
   A meta-analysis conducted on the distribution of standardized quadratic regression coefficients showed that the average quadratic coefficient was negative (i.e., the average species richness-productivity relationship was curvilinear and decelerating), and that the distribution of standardized quadratic regression coefficients was significantly heterogeneous.(i.e., the studies did not sample the same underlying species richness-productivity relationship).
   Looking more closely at the patterns of productivity-diversity relationships, we found that, for vascular plants at geographical scales smaller than continents, hump-shaped relationships occurred most frequently (41-45% of all studies). A positive relationship between productivity and species richness was the next most common pattern, and positive and hump-shaped relationships co-dominated at the continental scale. For animals, positive, negative, and hump-shaped patterns were common at most geographical scales, and no one pattern predominated. For both plants and animals, hump-shaped curves were relatively more common in studies that crossed community boundaries compared to studies conducted within a community type, and plant studies that crossed community types tended to span a greater range of productivity compared to studies Within community types. Sample size and plot size did not affect the probability of finding a particular productivity-diversity relationship (e.g., positive, hump-shaped, etc.). However, hump-shaped curves were especially common (65%) in studies of plant diversity that used plant biomass as a measure of productivity, and in studies conducted in aquatic systems.

AB Phenotypic selection on flower size in animal-pollinated plants can only occur when fitness is limited by pollinator visitation and when there is a relationship between flower size and pollinator attraction. The purpose of this study was (a) to examine how abiotic environmental conditions affect pollen limitation on female reproductive success and pollinator flower visitation and (b) to reveal whether phenotypic selection on floral traits in an alpine flowering species varied across an abiotic environmental gradient. In alpine populations of the perennial herb Ranunculus acris, I found that female reproductive success in a low-altitude population was significantly increased by experimental pollen addition, while plants at a higher altitude population did not respond to this treatment, presumably because low temperatures limited their seed production. At the low altitude, pollinators (muscoid flies) preferred to visit relatively large flowers, while no sign of flower discrimination occurred at the high altitude. Phenotypic selection regression analysis found that selection on flower size traits was more intense and frequent at the low-altitude compared to the high-altitude population. This result is consistent with the findings of stronger pollen limitation on seed set and the existence of pollinator discrimination on flower size at the low altitude compared to the high altitude. Pollinator visitation rates to flowers were nearly three times higher at the low altitude, compared to the high altitude. Thus, this study shows that the commonly assumed pathway from low pollinator availability to strong pollen limitation is not always correct but supports the view that selection on floral traits is positively related to the degree of pollen limitation. In R. acris environmental factors interact with pollen availability in determining the reproductive success of plants. and this interrupts the pathway from low pollinator availability via significant pollen limitation to selection on floral traits.

AB Dispersal dimorphisms, in which both flight-capable and flightless adults occur in the same species, are commonplace in insects. Such dimorphisms are seen as reflecting a balance between the benefits and costs of flight and wing reduction or loss. In heterogeneous habitats. theory predicts that fitness trade-offs can favor the evolution of a dispersal dimorphism in which both flight-capable and flightless morphs are retained in the same population, Despite the wealth of theory, however. there has never been an explicit field assessment of how habitat heterogeneity directly influences the reproductive success of the flight-capable and flightless wing forms of an insect species.
   The objective of this research was to investigate how variation in habitat heterogeneity (vegetation structure) and female density influence mate location and thus the potential for reproductive success by the male wing forms of a salt marsh inhabiting insect, the planthopper Prokelisia dolus. By placing unmated females in the field at different densities and in sparse and contiguous vegetation, we were able to compare the ability of male wing forms to locate stationary mates.
   Our data show that both vegetation structure and female density differentially influenced the ability of the male wing forms to locate mates. Flight-capable males located females and acquired matings far more frequently in sparse vegetation, whereas flightless males discovered females more often in contiguous vegetation. Flight-capable males located females more effectively at low female densities, whereas flightless males discovered females more efficiently at higher female densities. Thus, natural variation in vegetation structure and female density are two important factors which combine to influence the mating success of each male wing form. We conclude that habitat heterogeneity in concert with the known reproductive penalties imposed by flight capability (reduced siring ability) interact to favor the persistence of the dispersal polymorphism in males of this planthopper species.

AB Spatial synchrony in abundance among populations at different locations has been studied for many species. Different statistics have been used as measures of synchrony, and various techniques have been employed to test the hypothesis that there is no synchrony. In this paper we first describe and contrast various measures of synchrony and then discuss testing for no synchrony. Tests that ignore the serial correlation are commonly employed but are incorrect if there is serial correlation present, as is often the case with populations followed over time. Alternative approaches and their limitations are presented including tests based on residuals, adjusted degrees of freedom tests, and bootstrap procedures. We recommend tests based on residuals in a model-based setting. We also discuss some of the difficulties of finding model-free approaches and suggest some methods based on confidence intervals for future study.

AB I conducted two experiments in artificial stream channels. manipulating density of competitors, food abundance, and the possibility of emigration, to test whether density-dependence can operate through these factors in populations of a stream-dwelling salmonid fish, juvenile steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). In the absence of emigration, increasing levels of per capita food competition increased mortality, decreased growth, and increased the variance in size distributions of surviving individuals. Smaller fish were more likely to occupy less profitable areas of the stream channel than larger individuals and did so with increasing frequency as food abundance decreased and stocking density increased.
   When I allowed fish to emigrate from the stream channels, food and stocking density again influenced mortality, growth, and size distributions of survivors. Emigration was more likely at increasing levels of per capita competition; emigrants were smaller and in poorer condition than nonemigrants. The ability to emigrate from a population appears to normalize final size distributions and increase mean fish size within the stream channels. Thus, although both food and space are important factors shaping the demography of stream salmonid populations, neither appears to limit salmonid abundance exclusively.

AB The decomposition of plant residues is influenced by their chemical composition, the physical-chemical environment, and the decomposer organisms. Most studies interested in latitudinal gradients of decomposition have focused on substrate quality and climate effects on decomposition, and have excluded explicit recognition of the soil organisms involved in the process. To test whether soil fauna exhibit different effects under diverse climates or substrates, we quantified decomposition rates and N fluxes in control and fauna-excluded treatments with litterbags containing relatively high-quality (Quercus gambelii) and low-quality (Cecropia scheberiana) litter in sites representing large differences in climate as measured by AET (actual evapotranspiration). Two subtropical sites included a wet and a dry forest, and two temperate sites included north- and south-facing subalpine forests. We found that: (1) all three factors (climate, substrate quality, and soil fauna) independently influenced the decomposition rate of plant litter in the tropical and subalpine forests (2) faunal effects on decomposition rates and N mineralization of e. gambelii and C. scheberiana were consistently higher in the tropical wet forest than in the tropical dry and subalpine forests; (3) there was no significant interaction of fauna and litter species on the annual decay rates; and (4) the density (numbers per gram of dry litter) of total fauna was highest in the tropical wet forest, intermediate in the subalpine forests, and lowest in the tropical dry forest. Our results indicate that soil fauna have a disproportionately larger effect on litter decomposition in a tropical wet forest than in a tropical dry or a subalpine forest. The annual decay rates of e. gambelii and C. scheberiana are not influenced differentially by the soil fauna in the tropical and subalpine forests.

AB The trade-offs between nutrient and parasite intake for herbivores foraging in nutrient-poor systems are poorly understood. We tested whether a trade-off exists between the benefit of increased nutrient intake rate through grazing relatively tall swards and risks of parasitism in a grazing situation for sheep. The effect of level of feeding motivation and parasitic status on the grazing behavior of sheep faced with this trade-off was also investigated. Animals were presented with pairs of experimental swards (36 X 21 cm) that varied in height (12 cm = H+; 6 cm = H-) and level of contamination with feces from sheep infected with Ostertagia circumcincta (20 g feces per sward = FS; no feces = F-) and were allowed to graze for short periods. Experiment 1 presented four choices (H+F+ vs. H-F-; H+F+ vs. H-FS; H+F- vs. H-F-; H+F- vs. H-F+) repeated three times to 24 5-mo-old sheep divided into four animal treatment groups resulting from two levels of feeding motivation (high and moderate) and two parasitic states (parasitized and nonparasitized). Experiment 2 presented the above four choices three times each to 24 12-mo-old sheep in four animal treatment groups created from two parasitic states (parasitized and nonparasitized) and two immune states (immune and naive to O. circumcincta). All animals selected 12-cm swards over 6-cm swards in both experiments. In all choices except the trade-off choice, in both experiments, one award held a clear height or feces benefit (absence of feces) that was selected for by all treatments. When presented with the trade-off choice (H+F+ vs. H-F-), animals with a high feeding motivation selected the H+F+ sward more than moderately motivated animals did in Experiment 1. Immune animals selected the H+F+ sward more than naive animals did in Experiment 2. Subclinical parasitism in moderately feeding-motivated animals resulted in increased avoidance of feces and reduced grazing depths, thereby reducing further risk of parasitism in Experiment 1. This effect of parasitism was not repeated in the older animals of Experiment 2, where all animals maintained a high-parasite-risk grazing strategy by selecting the H+F+ award of the trade-off choice. However, parasitized animals in Experiment 2 reduced parasite intake and, therefore, the risks associated with grazing the H-I-FS sward by significantly reducing their grazing depth compared to all other treatment groups. Sheep grazing decisions involving forage intake and feces avoidance were affected by their feeding motivation, immune state, and parasitic state. Strong avoidance of feces-contaminated pasture can be overcome by the attraction of herbivores to tall swards. Trade-off frameworks are able to predict diet selection and grazing behavior, are useful when investigating host-parasite interactions, and may enhance the predictive powers of optimal foraging models.

AB Some herbivorous insect taxa that exhibit otherwise conservative patterns of host association include species or populations with atypical host specificities. These species provide special opportunities to study the evolution of host range. Uroleucon ambrosiae aphids present an example. Most Uroleucon species are monophagous on particular host plants from the Asteraceae, and U. ambrosiae appears to specialize on the giant ragweed, Ambrosia trifida, in eastern North America. In the American Southwest, however, U. ambrosiae uses a variety of asteraceous taxa as hosts. For the present study, we assayed host-associated behaviors of U. ambrosiae from both eastern and southwestern regions of the United States on each of four asteraceous genera. Data from choice and no-choice experiments and electrical penetration graph analyses revealed highly significant differences in the acceptability of the four test plants. Plant taxa were ranked in the same order across multiple behavioral assays by aphids from both regions. However, eastern and southwestern aphids exhibited significantly different patterns of behavior. Ambrosia was the most highly accepted plant by aphids from both regions, but southwestern aphids accepted the other test plants more readily than did eastern aphids, indicating geographic variation in degree of host specificity. This regional differentiation held for aphids reared under controlled conditions for the EPG studies, indicating a genetic basis for population divergence in U. ambrosiae host-use traits. We speculate that the generalism within U, ambrosiae is an evolutionarily derived trait and represents an ecological adaptation to the scattered and unpredictable distribution of the preferred A. trifida host in the arid American Southwest.

AB Many infectious diseases of humans are caused by pathogens that reside in nonhuman animal reservoirs and are transmitted to humans via the bite of an arthropod vector Most vectors feed from a variety of host species that differ dramatically in their reservoir competence; that is, their probability of transmitting the infection from host to vector. We explore a conceptual model of what we termed the "dilution effect," whereby the presence of vertebrate hosts with a low capacity to infect feeding vectors (incompetent reservoirs) dilute the effect of highly competent reservoirs, thus reducing disease risk. Using Lyme disease as an example, we demonstrate the presence and estimate the magnitude of the dilution effect for local sites in eastern New York State. We found that the prevalence of Lyme disease spirochetes, Borrelia burgdorferi, in field-collected Ixodes ticks (37.6% and 70.5% for nymphal and adult stages, respectively) was dramatically lower than expected (similar to 90% and >95% for nymphal and adult stages, respectively) if ticks fed predominantly on highly competent reservoirs, white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus). We inferred the role of additional host species using an empirically based model that incorporated data on tick burdens per host, relative population densities of hosts, and reservoir competence of each host. Assuming an empirically realistic reservoir competence of 5% for non-mouse and non-chipmunk hosts, we determined that alternative hosts must provide 61% and 72% of larval and nymphal meals, respectively. Using computer simulations, we assembled simulated host communities that differed in species richness, evenness, and net interactions between alternative hosts and mice. We found that increasing species richness (but not evenness) reduced disease risk. Effects were most pronounced when the most competent disease reservoirs were community dominants and when alternative hosts had a net negative influence on the dominance of mice as a host for ticks. Our results highlight a critical role of biodiversity and host community ecology in the transmission of vector-borne zoonotic diseases that in turn has important consequences for human health.

AB In 1927, Werner Heisenberg proposed that there are fundamental limitations to the study of subatomic particles, as the act of measuring them affects their behavior. Here we show that experimenter-induced uncertainty also applies in plant ecology, with potentially dramatic consequences for field biologists. We tested whether the simple act of visiting marked plants once per week for eight weeks influenced the intensity of herbivory experienced by six plant species in an old field community. Half of the plants were touched once per week to simulate taking morphological measures, while the other half were left undisturbed (neither Visited nor touched). After eight weeks, visitation resulted in (1) decreased leaf damage by insects on one species, (2) increased leaf damage on a second species, (3) a marginally significant increase in survival for a third species, and (4) no effect on the remaining three species. These results serve as an important reminder that seemingly benign experimental methods may themselves dramatically affect the performance of experimental subjects. Our results raise concern about studies that use repeated visitation of focal plants either to compare rates of herbivory among species or to investigate some factor that can either directly or indirectly be influenced by the rate of herbivory (e.g., seed production, competition, etc.). Since The six species in our study responded differently to visitation, visitation effects must be accounted for in the design of future field experiments.

AB Lianas, woody climbing plants, are a conspicuous component of tropical forest canopies that might affect prevailing conditions in the forest floor and thus impact tree seedling regeneration. The effects of lianas on tree seedling survival, growth, and density were studied in a lowland liana forest in Bolivia. Gravimetric soil water content and canopy openness were measured to evaluate whether these factors changed as a result of liana cutting. I established 24 square plots of 900 m(2) each, and after an initial set of measurements, all lianas were cut in half of them, while the others plots were used as controls. Tree seedling growth and survival of two tree species were evaluated: Clarisia ilicifolia and Astronium fraxinifolium. Eighteen months after liana cutting, seedlings in liana-cut plots grew significantly taller and produced more leaves than did seedlings in control plots, but survival was not affected by treatment. Seedling growth following liana cutting was significantly higher in A. fraxinifolium than in C. ilicifolia seedlings. Densities of tree and liana seedlings did not change after liana cutting. Gravimetric sail water content was apparently not affected by liana-cut treatment. Canopy openness increased significantly in liana-cut plots, but only by 4%, and only after 26 mo. I conclude that lianas hinder the growth of tree species seedlings differentially, which in turn might shift the balance in competitive interactions between seedlings. Thus, at the study site lianas could affect tree regeneration.

AB We analyzed survival of breeding Greater Flamingos, Phoenicopterus ruber roseus, using the capture histories of 2000 breeding birds ringed as chicks and resighted at their natal colony in the Camargue, southern France. As found in previous analyses, recapture probability varied according to year, sex, and age of the bird, and annual survival was strongly affected by winter severity. However, by using a much larger data set than in earlier analyses, we detected previously nonsignificant effects. Indeed, for the first time, sex and age of the bird were found to influence annual survival probability. We tested the hypothesis that the observed sex-related difference, in survival corresponded to asymmetric costs of reproduction. A model including a cost of first observed reproduction on survival in young females only provided the best fit to the data and explained the majority of the sex-related difference in survival of birds <7 yr old. Because a cost of reproduction may be partially masked by birds that have already bred undetected, we estimated the proportion of experienced females among those observed breeding for the first time. This proportion varied with the age of the birds and was used to calculate: the expected cost of early recruitment. Such a cost of early reproduction may have contributed to the evolution of deferred breeding in females. Survival of experienced females was higher than that of males, with the difference being more pronounced in early age classes. Age had a significant positive effect on survival probability of birds.

AB The contemporary literature accepts that disturbance strongly influences patterns of species diversity, and that the relationship is peaked, with a maximum at intermediate levels of disturbance. We tested this hypothesis using a compilation of published species diversity-disturbance relationships that were gleaned from a literature search of papers published from 1985 through 1996 and from references therein. We identified 116 species richness-, 53 diversity-, and 28 evenness-disturbance relationships in the literature, which we grouped according to shape of relationship (nonsignificant, peaked, negative monotonic, positive monotonic, or U-shaped). We tested the relationships between the strength and shapes of these relationships and attributes of the community, disturbance, and sampling and study design. Nonsignificant relationships were the most common, comprising 35% of richness, 28% of diversity, and 50% of evenness studies. Peaked responses were reported in only 16% of richness, 19% of diversity, and 11% of evenness cases. Explained variation in the three measures of diversity was variable among studies but averaged similar to 50%. It was higher when few samples and few disturbance levels were examined and when organisms within the samples were not exhaustively censused, suggesting that procedural artifact contributes to these relationships. Explained variation was also higher in studies in which disturbance was measured as a gradient of time passed since the last disturbance (mean r(2) = 61%), vs. studies of spatial variation in richness (mean r(2) = 42%). Peaked richness relationships had the greatest odds of being observed when sampled area and actual evapotranspiration were small, when disturbances were natural rather than anthropogenic in origin, and when few disturbance levels were examined. Thus, on average, diversity-disturbance relationships do not have consistently high r(2) and are not as consistently peaked as the contemporary consensus would suggest.

AB We investigate biological mechanisms that generate oscillations and chaos in multispecies competition models. For this purpose, we use a competition model concerned with competition for abiotic essential resources. Because phytoplankton and plants consume quite a number of abiotic essential resources, the model is particularly relevant for phytoplankton communities and terrestrial vegetation. We show that the predicted dynamics depend crucially on the relationship between the resource requirements and the resource consumption characteristics of the species. More specifically, the model predicts that competition generates (1) stable coexistence if species consume most of the resources for which they have high requirements, (2) oscillations and chaos if species consume most of the resources for which they have intermediate requirements, and (3) competitive exclusion with a winner that depends on the initial conditions if species consume most of the resources for which they have low requirements. The theoretical predictions are compared with available data on resource utilization patterns of phytoplankton species.

AB We studied the dynamics of a univoltine stream-dwelling caddistly, Brachycentrus americanus, and its microsporidian disease for 15 yr. The pathogen is highly virulent. with infections generally resulting in death during the larval stage. In most years, we sampled Brachycentrus immatures every 1-2 mo to estimate population density and disease prevalence. Brachycentrus population dynamics exhibited strong evidence for direct and delayed (1 generation lag) density dependence and appeared to cycle with a period of similar to4 yr. Pathogen prevalence in Brachycentrus was > 10% in all generations and frequently exceeded 50%. Disease prevalence also exhibited cyclic behavior. with peaks in prevalence following Brachycentrus generations with relatively high population density. There was no evidence for direct density-dependent parasitism. but there was strong evidence for density-dependent infection delayed by one generation. A path analysis model suggested that the disease mediated much of the strong density dependence observed in Brachycentrus. Collectively, these observations suggest that the pathogen is largely responsible for driving observed Brachycentrus dynamics.

AB In this paper we test whether the morphology and life traits of species (in our case ground beetles of the family Carabidae) can be related to the main underlying axes of environmental variability of their habitats. Sites were selected a priori to maximize two gradients: land use as a general measure of disturbance characterized by an index of land management, and habitat adversity or stress as characterized by elevation and vegetation structure. The underlying environmental axes and the relationships of the morphology and life traits of the species with them were investigated using RLQ analysis, a multivariate ordination method able to relate a species trait table to a site characteristics table by way of a species abundance table. The first environmental axis was highly statistically significant and explained most of the variability. It was strongly negatively related to the intensity of land management, and positively related to increasing elevation and a set of variables reflecting vegetation stress. Two predictions were tested and found to be valid in the studied system: in highly managed lowland sites species were smaller, and the frequency of macropterous species (with better dispersal abilities) was higher. Other traits also showed significant relationships with the main environmental axis: in the intensively managed lowland sites species had broader bodies, longer trochanters, and wider femora (characters associated with plant eaters), were paler in color, overwintered only as adults, bred in spring or autumn, and were active in summer. We conclude that the ground beetle assemblages of the studied sites respond in a similar way to the same underlying environmental factors. This allows the precise definition of functional groups, which can be used to characterize functional diversity and its relationships with changes in land management.

AB The perception that primary production in lakes is positively related to phosphorus loading is based almost entirely on studies of phytoplankton. This is partly because benthic and pelagic habitats in lakes are often treated as separate ecosystems, the processes of which can be evaluated independently. However, Light and nutrients often limit primary producers in both benthic and pelagic habitats. We tested the hypothesis that reductions in light associated with increases in phytoplankton could cause compensatory decreases in benthic algal (periphyton) primary production. We monitored production of periphyton on sediments (epipelon), periphyton on wood (epixylon), and phytoplankton in four lakes in upper Michigan, USA, from 1991 to 1995. During the summers of 1993-1995, we stimulated phytoplankton production in three of the lakes by fertilizing with nitrogen and phosphorus (N:P greater than or equal to 25 by atoms) at rates between 0.3 and 2.0 mg P .m(-3).d(-1). The response of periphyton to fertilization was substratum specific: epixylon increased with fertilization, but epipelon decreased. However, when area-specific production was extrapolated to the whole-lake scale, epixylon never constituted >4% of benthic primary production. Thus, the decline in epipelic production dominated the benthic response to fertilization. We also estimated whole-lake (epipelon + phytoplankton) primary production. Epipelic algae constituted 50-80% of whole-lake primary production at ambient nutrient levels. However, only 10-40% of primary production was benthic at the highest fertilization rates. The increase in whole-lake primary production caused by water column fertilization was greatly overestimated when we did not include the compensatory decline in epipelic algae as they were shaded by increases in phytoplankton concentrations.

AB In an old-growth Pilzus-Populus-Acer forest, treefall areas did not diverge from undisturbed control areas over a 12-yr period following windstorm disturbance. Woody plant populations sampled in 1984, 1992, and 1996 changed significantly over time, but changes in treefall areas did not differ from changes in control areas in plant species richness, composition, or vegetation structure. Preexisting tall shrubs and windfirm saplings cast heavy shade even where canopy trees blew down, preventing formation of deep Iightgaps and limiting resource heterogeneity on the forest floor. Thus, in this forest, disturbance by moderate windstorm did not initiate the sort of patch dynamics that enriches diversity by admitting light-demanding species into the understory. The unresponsiveness of the understory, juxtaposed with heavy mortality to shade-intolerant species, suggests that moderate windstorms will neither initiate patch dynamics nor set back succession, but will instead hasten successional takeover by shade-tolerant trees in such forests.

AB Indirect interactions among species may be important for understanding community dynamics because species generally interact with more species indirectly than directly. Although various kinds of indirect effects have been documented, estimates of indirect effects are based on estimates of the direct interactions occurring on a short time scale. In the present study, we report that predicted indirect effects may not represent the actual indirect effects in a rocky intertidal habitat. Gulls feed on green foliose algae during winter, and these foliose algae inhibit crows from foraging on chitons. This is because algal mats cover the chitons during spring. By connecting these direct interactions, gulls are expected to indirectly increase crow foraging. However, gulls indirectly decreased crows foraging because gull feeding increased the number of foliose algal mats during spring. This result indicates that the consequence of a direct effect may occasionally change temporally from negative to positive before an indirect effect appears. Therefore, indirect effects should not be estimated merely by connecting direct effects on a short-term basis.

AB Environmental sex determination may yield biased sex ratios, as is the case in many reptilian species with temperature - dependent sex determination (TSD). Determining TSD thermal ecology is important to understanding sex ratio evolution in those species, as TSD systems may pose a challenge to Fisherian models that predict the production of 1:1 sex ratios through frequency-dependent selection. Unfortunately, the relationship between fluctuating temperatures and sex in nature remains poorly understood. Here I present a novel statistical model of TSD in the endangered Amazonian freshwater turtle, Podocnemis expansa. designed to account for heterogeneous daily fluctuations of natural nest temperatures by comparing laboratory and field data on sex ratios, developmental stages, cumulative temperature units (CTUs), and time spent below the survival threshold (28 degreesC). Experiments encompassed constant, shift-once, and shift-twice temperatures in the laboratory, plus depth and shading treatments in the field. A constant temperature of 32.6 degreesC produced 1: 1 males : females, the highest pivotal temperature ever reported for a turtle species. The thermosensitive period for sex determination (TSP) roughly occurs during developmental stages 17-24 as determined from shift experiments. The CTUs during the TSP plus the number of hours below 28 degreesC prior to the TSP significantly explained sex ratio production in the combined laboratory and field data set (positive and negative effects, respectively). However, the relationship for field nests only was not significant. Higher temperatures had a disproportionately larger effect on female production in the combined field and laboratory data set. Depth and shading had drastic effects on nest temperature, embryonic development, and sex ratio. Seasonal climate changes can override the effect of nest depth via differences in oviposition time. Two of the shaded nests experienced the coldest temperatures of all field nests but yielded the highest female proportion, according to a TSDII pattern (when females are produced at low and high temperatures and males are produced at intermediate temperatures). Thus Podocnemis expansa may be a TSDII species, but this intrinsic system seems to be realized as TSDIa in nature (males produced at low temperatures and females produced at high temperatures), because of the general lethality of cold temperatures which precludes the production of low-temperature females.

AB The combined effects of predators on prey may substantially differ from that of each predator species alone because of alterations in prey behavior. Using enclosures within a pond, we examined experimentally the effects of two piscivorous predators on prey mortality and prey resource levels in two habitats. The two predators use two different foraging modes, which also allowed us to examine the behaviorally induced indirect effects of prey on predator growth and prey food resources.
   Both perch (Perca fluviatilis) and pike (Esox lucius) caused significant mortality of roach (Rutilus rutilus), and the combined predator mortality was higher than predicted from a multiplicative prey consumption model. Growth rates of perch were similar when enclosures contained only perch and when they contained perch combined with pike. The growth rate of pike was higher when they were together with perch compared to when alone. Growth of roach was similar among treatments. The invertebrate food resources of roach increased by a factor 10 in the open water but remained at similar levels throughout the experiment in the vegetation. Biomass of Daphnia longispina, the dominant zooplankton species in the open water, was strongly correlated with mortality of roach, indicating a density-mediated indirect effect of predators on prey resources. There was no indirect effect on D. longispina in the vegetation caused by habitat restriction of roach and only a weak relationship in the open water. There was a strong indirect effect of pike predation on macro invertebrates induced by a habitat shift of roach.
   Our results suggest that there was facilitation between predators caused by conflicting antipredator behavior of roach, which resulted in density-mediated indirect effects on prey resources. The behavioral response of roach to the two predators also induced indirect effects on invertebrate prey.

AB Nitrogen retention and recycling are topics of enduring interest in ecosystem ecology, yet we lack a mechanistic field-tested model of how these processes work in unpolluted, old-growth temperate forests. Forests of the Cordillera Piuchue Ecosystem Study (CPES) in southern Chile provide an opportunity to examine nitrogen cycling and retention in a forest that is virtually free of human disturbance. We applied N-15 pool dilution and pulse-chase tracer techniques as complementary approaches within small plots to understand flows of inorganic nitrogen in the surface soil of an evergreen mixed-angio sperm forest. We also followed separate pulses of (NH4+)-N-15 and (NO3-)-N-15 for two years to gain insights into how short-term mechanisms of inorganic nitrogen cycling translate into long-term patterns of ecosystem nitrogen retention.
   Strong consumption appears to limit losses of NH4+ and NO3- from this forest, and predominantly by the same mechanisms for both forms of nitrogen. As a result, the extent of (NH4-)-N-15 and (NO3-)-N-15 retention were also similar, yet similar to 44-fold higher rates of gross NH4+ production leads to the dominance of NH4+ over NO3- in soil and stream waters. Microbial biomass played a key role in the short-term assimilation of N-15 tracers, but retention was only transient. Turnover of N-15 through microbial biomass was rapid and appeared to be only weakly retained in soil exchangeable pools, fine roots, and soil organic matter, resulting in substantial losses of N-15 from soils within weeks of tracer additions. Assimilation of N-15 into fine roots was a much larger sink (13%) than has been reported for other forested ecosystems (1-3%), and the transport of N-15 from microbial biomass to aboveground sinks in vegetation may explain the observed loss of N-15 from surface soils over time. Losses of N-15 from microbial biomass did not enter the extractable pool of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), suggesting that DON losses do not originate directly from active microbial turnover, and also that microbial activity may not exert as much control over hydrologic losses of DON as compared to losses of NH4+ and NO3- Our results also suggest an additional rapid and extremely transient (1 d) mechanism of NO3- retention via incorporation into extractable-DON.
   The long-term retention of N-15 at the whole-plot level did not differ significantly between (NH4-)-N-15 and 15NO3- treatments, and averaged 65% after two years. The lack of an appreciable change in 15N recovery for similar to1.5 yr following the initial assimilation, redistribution, and loss of N-15 suggests that the majority of N-15 was not recycled over the long term through inorganic. nitrogen pools and microbial biomass via mineralization/immobilization pathways. Instead, long-term retention of inorganic N-15 appeared to be dominated by rapid and possibly direct assimilation into a slow-turnover pool of soil organic matter. Elevated N-15 contents in fine-root and microbial pools for up to two years after N-15 additions, however, also indicated sustained biotic retention of inorganic nitrogen. Our results suggest very similar retention of NH4+ and NO3- that is dominated by rapid assimilation and turnover through microbial biomass in the short term (weeks), and transfer from microbial biomass into nitrogen-conserving plant (and to a lesser extent soil organic matter) pools in the long term (years). These processes result in efficient long-term retention of nitrogen in unpolluted old-growth temperate forests.

AB Current theory on trophic interactions in food webs assumes that ecologically similar species can be treated collectively as a single functional unit such as a guild or trophic level. This theory implies that all species within that unit transmit identical direct and indirect effects throughout the community. We evaluated this assumption by conducting experiments to compare the direct and indirect effects of three top-predator species, belonging to the same hunting spider guild, on the same species of grasshopper and on old-field grasses and herbs. Observations under field conditions revealed that each spider species exhibited different hunting behavior (i.e., sit-and-wait. sit-and-pursue, and active hunting) and occupied different locations within the vegetation canopy. These differences resulted in different direct effects on grasshopper prey. Grasshoppers demonstrated significant behavioral (diet) shifts in the presence of sit-and-wait and sit-and-pursue species but not when faced with actively hunting species. Grasshopper density was significantly reduced by spider species that occupied lower parts of the vegetation canopy (sit-and-pursue and actively hunting species), but it was not significantly reduced by the sit-and-wait spider species that occupied the upper parts of the canopy. These direct effects manifested themselves differently in the plant trophic level. The sit-and-wait spider caused indirect effects on plants by changing grasshopper foraging behavior (a trait-mediated effect). The sit-and-pursue spider caused indirect effects by reducing grasshopper density (density-mediated effects); the effects of changes in grasshopper behavior were thus not reflected in the plant trophic level. The actively hunting spiders had strictly density-mediated indirect effects on plants. The study offers mechanistic insight into how predator species within the same guild can have very different trophic effects in food webs. Thus classical modeling approaches that treat all predator species as a single functional unit may not adequately capture biologically relevant details that influence community dynamics.

AB Three previous studies have disagreed on whether breeding synchrony increases nest success through reduced nest predation in Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) in eastern North America. We used data from an 11-yr study of redwings in eastern Ontario, Canada, to duplicate the analyses of the one study (by D. E Westneat) that did show that nesting synchrony reduced predation. We found no evidence that nest predation and nest success were affected by nesting synchrony. We did find significant effects of female age, clutch size, and clutch initiation date on nest success, but overall, our independent variables explained very little variation in nest success. We hypothesize that the difference between our results and Westneat's may be attributable to differences in the principal nest predators. Mammals appeared to be important nest predators in our study, as is typical for eastern populations of Red-winged Blackbirds. Mammals appeared to be less important nest predators in Westneat's study, probably because that study area was fenced and the grass between ponds was mowed. Red-winged Blackbirds mob avian predators, but have limited ability to defend nests from mammals. Group mobbing of avian predators could result in a positive relationship between nesting synchrony and nest success when birds are the most important nest predators. The greater importance of avian nest predators in western than in eastern populations of Red-winged Blackbirds could account for some differences in social polygyny between those populations. However, our results indicate that nesting decisions by female redwings in eastern populations should not be affected by the nesting activity of other females. Thus, social polygyny in this population does not arise through an advantage of group living.

AB Sheltered rocky bays in the Gulf of Maine support communities usually dominated either by the fucoid rockweed Ascophyllum nodosum or the mussel Mytilus edulis. In order to test whether clearing size determines the subsequent pattern of recruitment by intertidal organisms, we examined four common species in clearings in stands of A. nodosum. Circular experimental clearings of 1, 2, 4, and 8 m in diameter, which mimicked severe ice scour, and uncleared controls were established at 12 sites spread across four bays. Recruitment of A. nodosum and of three species not common in A. nodosum stands (mussels, barnacles, and the rockweed Fucus vesiculosus) varied with clearing size and the patterns did not vary among bays. Recruitment of A. nodosum declined exponentially with clearing size. Fucus and barnacles recruited in greater densities to large clearings (greater than or equal to4 m) compared to small clearings (<4 m). Recruitment of F. vesiculosus was also site specific, reflecting patterns of local abundance, but that of A. nodosum was not. Mussels recruited onto artificial substrates in fewer numbers in large clearings, but in marginally greater numbers to rock underneath these substrates in large clearings. Recruitment densities of mussels and barnacles were strongly site specific. These results suggest that (1) the rate of succession varies site specifically, and (2) the trajectory of succession, either convergence toward or divergence from the surrounding community, is contingent upon the interplay between species interactions and the size of the clearing.

AB A species' thermal and hydric environments may vary significantly throughout its range. However, geographic variation in physiological parameters related to water-saving ability has been largely ignored in mammals, even though there are dramatic differences among the environments in which many species exist. Heteromyid rodents long have been the focus of investigations concerning mammalian adaptations to severely desiccating environments. Representatives of one widely distributed subspecies of Merriam's kangaroo rat, Dipodomys merriami merriami, were collected from three locations that differ in environmental temperatures and aridity. Mass, evaporative water loss, urine osmolality, rate of fractional body-mass loss, fecal water content, and metabolic rate were measured under desiccating conditions. Individuals from the most arid locality were smaller, possessed lower total and mass-specific evaporative water loss (EWL), and lost proportionately less mass under dehydrating conditions than those from less arid locations. These results indicate that EWL, but not kidney function or fecal water loss, is a trait associated with conserving water in this subspecies.

AB Microorganisms can alter the direction and magnitude of plant-herbivore interactions. However, how they affect the susceptibility of the host plant and their impact on the herbivore may vary depending on the scale of the interaction such as among locations, individual plants, and parts of the plant. Positive preference-performance relationships for insects in general, and for sedentary insects such as leafminers in particular, would predict that there would be negative selection pressure against females ovipositing in low-performance sites. Thus, where the presence of microorganisms causes reduced performance, selection would favor oviposition in sites where the microbes are absent. However, this assumes that ovipositing females can detect the microbes and respond by avoidance, or that females can use cues that predict the future presence of microbes and use these predictors to respond by avoidance.
   We used the Cameraria sp. leafminer-Quercus emoryi system and the associated fungal endophyte species that share the leaves of the host to test the hypothesis that leafminer ovipositional preference and therefore distribution are negatively associated with endophyte distribution at scales where endophytes mediate insect antagonism and where endophyte distribution is predictable. We censused fungal endophyte distribution and abundance on >20 trees over three growing seasons at the following scales: among trees, among positions within trees, among leaves, and between and within seasons. In addition, we censused leafminer distribution and abundance and used data on leafminer distributions at different spatial scales collected over the past decade from other studies in this system to determine how they are associated with endophytes. We found that leafminers and fungal endophytes were negatively associated at two spatial scales where endophytes have been shown to affect leafminer performance negatively and where endophyte distribution and abundance were predictable. Endophytes and leafminers were not associated at one spatial scale where endophytes do not affect leafminers, and distribution and abundance was not predictable. Leafminer growth and endophyte infection were positively associated over time as both increase over the season. The results demonstrate that leafminer ovipositional preference may have been selected by avoidance of fungal endophytes and associated endophyte mediated antagonism, but that avoidance is reliant on predictable patterns of infection.

AB Although metapopulation theory is widely used in basic and applied ecology, there are still few empirical studies that explore the relationships between dispersal, patch size, and the persistence of natural populations. Here, we reanalyzed data from a six-year study of a spatially structured field vole (Microtus agrestis) metapopulation in the Tvarminne archipelago, Finland. Our goal was to address several issues relevant to metapopulation studies: (1) the relationships between within-subpopulation dynamics, dispersal behavior, habitat quality, and metapopulation dynamics; (2) the generality of one of the most common conclusions of metapopulation theory-that smaller and less frequently inhabited islands are less important for metapopulation dynamics; and (3) the comparison of different methods for understanding and predicting dynamics in "metapopulation-like" systems. Our results suggest that this vole metapopulation is driven by extinctions and colonizations of island subpopulations. However, contrary to expectation, colonizations by voles from tiny, ephemeral skerry subpopulations were about as important for metapopulation persistence as were colonizations from the more persistent subpopulations on large islands. This pattern resulted from less stable vole densities on smaller islands, combined with increased emigration preceding subpopulation extinctions. Either spatially implicit Levins models or incidence function models provided reasonable predictions of the structure and function of this metapopulation, but parameters fitted to incidence functions varied dramatically among years. Our results suggest that models of real metapopulations need not become highly detail oriented or spatially complicated to provide good predictive power. However, applications of metapopulation theory require careful consideration of how underlying ecological and behavioral mechanisms will shape metapopulation dynamics of particular species and situations.

AB Our objective was to infer the controls of spatial variation in historical fire regimes. We reconstructed a multicentury history of fire frequency, size, season, and severity from fire scars and establishment dates of 1426 trees sampled on grids in four watersheds (similar to 64 plots, over similar to 1620 ha each) representative of the Blue Mountains, Oregon and Washington, USA. The influence of regional climate, a top-down control, was inferred from among-watershed variation in fire regimes, while the influence of local topography, a bottom-up control, was inferred from within-watershed variation. Before about 1900, fire regimes varied among and within watersheds, suggesting that both top-down and bottom-up controls were important. At the regional scale, dry forests (dominated by ponderosa pine), burned twice as frequently and earlier in the growing season in southern watersheds than in northern watersheds, consistent with longer and drier fire seasons to the south. Mesic forests (dominated by subalpine fir or grand fir) probably also burned more frequently to the south. At the local scale, fire frequency varied with different parameters of topography in watersheds with steep terrain, but not in the watershed with gentle terrain. Frequency varied with aspect in watersheds where topographic facets are separated by significant barriers to fire spread, but not in watersheds where such facets interfinger without fire barriers. Frequency varied with elevation where elevation and aspect interact to create gradients in snow-cover duration and also where steep talus interrupts fuel continuity. Frequency did not vary with slope within any watershed. The presence of both regional-scale and local-scale variation in the Blue Mountains suggests that top-down and bottom-up controls were both important and acted simultaneously to influence fire regimes in the past. However, an abrupt decline in fire frequency around 1900 was much greater than any regional or local variation in the previous several centuries and indicates that 20th-century fire regimes in these watersheds were dramatically affected by additional controls such as livestock grazing and fire suppression. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of examining spatial variation in historical fire regimes across scales as a means for inferring their controls.

AB Local guilds define groups of species that share common resources and coexist in space and time. Local guilds have historically been a major focus of community ecology; however, studies of local guilds rarely measure consequences of coexistence for fitness-related traits or test predictions of alternative hypotheses for how species may interact. We studied consequences of coexistence for Orange-crowned Warblers (Vermivora celata) and Virginia's Warblers (V. virginiae), which have overlapping breeding territories in central Arizona. We used reciprocal removal experiments to examine (1) whether coexistence results in ecological consequences with respect to access to nest sites, access to food resources, nest predation, and adult female predation, and (2) whether ecological consequences result in fitness consequences with respect to reproductive success (clutch size, number of young fledged per nest), or adult female survival (within a breeding season). When we removed Virginia's Warblers, Orange-crowned Warblers experienced reduced nest predation rates compared with control plots where Virginia's Warblers were present. When we removed Orange-crowned Warblers, Virginia's Warblers (1) shifted their nest sites to sites indistinguishable from Orange-crowned Warbler nest sites, (2) increased feeding rates during both the incubation and nest:ling periods, and (3) suffered reduced nest predation rates, compared with control plots where Orange-crowned Warblers were present. When the two species coexist, increased nest predation rates for both species appear to result from density-dependent functional shifts in nest predator behavior (short-term apparent competition). Reduced access to preferred nest sites for Virginia's Warblers coexisting with Orange-crowned Warblers appears to result from both Orange-crowned Warbler interference during nest site selection and building periods, and from Orange-crowned Warbler preemption of nest sites preferred by both species. The mechanisms whereby Orange-crowned Warblers may reduce access to food resources for coexisting Virginia's Warblers, however, are not yet fully understood. Both. Orange-crowned and Virginia's Warblers fledged between 78% and 129% more young per nest on plots where the opposite species had been removed, indicating that both species suffer substantial fitness costs of coexistence. Overall, results illustrate that (I) Orange-crowned and Virginia's Warblers do not coexist independently of each other, (2) interactions between the two species are complex and asymmetrical, (3) interactions between the two species result in substantial fitness costs of coexistence for both species, and (4) ecological interactions between the two species extend far beyond competition for food resources which has dominated studies of terrestrial vertebrate communities.

AB Species are commonly segregated along gradients of microclimate and vegetation. I explore the question of whether segregation is the result of microhabitat partitioning (biotic effects) or choice of differing microclimates (abiotic effects). I explored this question for four ground-nesting bird species that an segregated along a microclimate and vegetation gradient in Arizona. Birds shifted position of their nests on the microhabitat and microclimate gradient in response to changing precipitation over nine years. Similarly, annual bird abundance varied with precipitation across 12 yr. Those shifts in abundance and nesting microhabitat with changing precipitation demonstrate the importance of abiotic influences on bird distributions and habitat choice. However, nest-site shifts and microhabitat use also appear to be influenced by interactions among coexisting species. Moreover, shifts in habitat use by all species caused nest predation (i.e., biotic) costs that increased with increasing distance along the microclimate gradient. These results indicate that abiotic and biotic costs can strongly interact to influence microhabitat choice and abundances of coexisting species. Global climate change impacts have been considered largely in terms of simple distributional shifts, but these results indicate that shifts can also increase biotic costs when species move into habitat types for which they are poorly adapted or that create new biotic interactions.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation affect forest birds through direct loss of breeding habitats, detrimental edge effects such as increased nest predation and brood parasitism, and possibly by limiting movements among remaining forest patches. Despite indirect evidence suggesting that landscape-scale bird movements are constrained by open areas, skepticism remains because birds routinely cross inhospitable terrain during migration. Here, we report evidence from 201 independent homing trials showing that landscape composition and configuration influence the movements (1-4 km) of two neotropical migrant (Black-throated Blue Warbler, Dendroica caerulescens and the Ovenbird, Seiurus aurocapillus) and one resident (Black-capped Chickadee, Poecile atricapillus) forest bird species in Quebec, Canada. Trials consisted of translocating territorial, mated males and measuring the time they needed to return to their territories (homing time), as well as the probability with which they returned to their territories within 30 h (homing success). Birds took more time and were less likely to return to their territories as forest cover decreased in the landscape. Once the simple linear variation due to forest cover was removed from landscape configuration variables, their influence on homing time and success was nonexistent or subtle, suggesting that landscape composition has greater predictive value than landscape configuration to infer constraints on forest bird movements. Indeed, and contrary to our expectation, mean nearest-neighbor distance between forest patches had no impact on homing time or success, but its coefficient of variation was positively correlated with homing time and negatively correlated with homing success. On the other hand, homing time and success were not influenced by the number of forest patches or the amount of edge per unit of forest cover. These results were consistent for all three bird species that we studied. Our data support the hypothesis that movements are constrained when forest birds travel in deforested and fragmented landscapes outside migratory periods. Such an impediment is likely to disrupt habitat selection processes. reduce the colonization of isolated forest patches. and ultimately, alter population structure and dynamics.

AB A general prediction for aging placental mammals is that they should show a decline in reproductive value, and reproductive effort is therefore predicted to increase with age. To test this, we monitored known-age radio-collared females of a large ungulate, the moose (Alces alces), in a Swedish population. Female moose showed senescence in reproduction (i.e., litter size) from about 12 yr of age. Further evidence of senescence was a decrease in parental care during summer (expressed as increased offspring mortality) with the mother's age. Moreover, aging females facing a declining reproductive value increased their reproductive effort by giving birth to heavier offspring regardless of litter size. A logistic regression model showed that older moose have to give birth to heavier offspring to achieve the same offspring summer survival as that for offspring of younger mothers. This suggests that females increase their reproductive effort (by increasing offspring mass) as they get older. Furthermore, the rather intense harvest in our population may select for an increased reproductive effort in terms of litter size, which furthermore may select for an earlier onset of senescence in reproductive characters and mortality.

AB A wide variety of organisms inhabit streams, rivers, and estuaries where they are continually subjected to downstream drift. It is well known that when this is the only transport process, extinction is inevitable (the "drift paradox"). Using a series of analytical and numerical models, representing a range of hydrodynamic scenarios, we demonstrate that the action of diffusive dispersal can permit persistence in an advective environment. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon is that diffusive dispersal can allow a proportion of the population to reproduce close to their natal location. For well- and poorly mixed non-tidal systems we establish approximate analytic conditions for diffusion-mediated persistence both throughout the water column and in a benthic boundary layer. Although tidal forcing results in residual landward flow near the base of the water column, we find that this has little effect on persistence, which is respectably approximated by our analytic results. We apply these analytic results to four hydrodynamically disparate systems: a stream (Broadstone Stream [UK]), a river (Christiana Creek [USA]), a shallow estuary (Y than [UK]) and a deep fast-flowing estuary (Saco River [USA]), Using parameters derived from published studies we examine the persistence of a number of real and hypothetical organisms in these systems and identify those for which diffusively mediated persistence is a realistic possibility. We note that such persistence is only likely when advection is low or horizontal dispersal is high.

AB Global surveys have shown that increased precipitation in mesic to wet ecosystems increases soil carbon storage, but it is not clear how changes in water availability act to affect soil carbon since water is generally in excess of plant demand within these humid ecosystems. Differences in precipitation can affect soil carbon storage either by altering the biotic processes involved in carbon cycling or by altering abiotic processes such as carbon adsorption on soil minerals. We compared the relative effect of water on net primary productivity and decomposition, and on soil weathering and mineralogy in controlling soil carbon storage in forests. Patterns of ecosystem carbon cycling and soil carbon storage were measured in Hawaiian montane forest sites similar in temperature regime, parent material, ecosystem age, vegetation, and topographical relief, while mean annual precipitation alone varied from 2200 to > 5000 mm/yr. Soil carbon storage ranged from 30.9 to 62.5 kg/m(2) and increased by a factor of 1.7 with increased precipitation across the gradient. Neither changes in total secondary minerals nor noncrystalline mineral content could explain increased soil carbon as both decreased with increasing precipitation. Aboveground net primary productivity, soil carbon dioxide flux, and plant litter decomposition rates also decreased with increased precipitation. These data suggest that increased soil carbon storage was not stimulated by an increase in net primary productivity, but instead by a decrease in decomposition rates. Decreased decomposition rates corresponded with low soil reduction-oxidation potentials, suggesting that soil oxygen availability was limiting to microbes, While soil oxygen did not appear to affect plant growth directly, the decline in net primary productivity corresponded with decreased nitrogen availability, a consequence of slower decomposition and nutrient release. Thus, in humid environments the most important effect of variation in water on carbon cycling appears to be its control on the diffusion of oxygen into the soil.

AB We incorporate stochastic, density-dependent seasonal recruitment in adult Anopheles mosquito populations in a discrete-event model of Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission and find the probabilities of parasite extinction higher than with perennial transmission. Seasonal fluctuations in vector populations act to synchronize the dynamics of infection and immunity in host populations, leading to fluctuations in parasite prevalence greater than expected solely on the basis, of high- and low-season vector densities. This synchronization also biases frequencies of infection with multiple parasite phenotypes or genotypes.

AB Abundances of 12 laboratory populations of the greenbottle blowfly (Lucilia sericata) were recorded every two days for 776 d, with separate counts for larvae, pupae, and adults. Half of the populations were exposed to sublethal dosages of the toxic compound cadmium acetate; the remaining populations were considered controls. Initial density was low for half of the populations in each group, and high for the other half. In all populations, the adult abundance underwent sustained fluctuations. However, cadmium-exposed populations had smaller mean larval and adult densities, and fluctuations in adult abundance were less regular than for controls. Data from the first and the second half of the experimental period were analyzed separately in order to assess the effects of possible long-term changes in the dynamics on the estimates. Nonparametric (generalized) additive modeling (GAM) was used to investigate time series dynamics and, in particular, to explore the density-independent components and the structure of the density-dependent components of the system. Overall, cadmium populations had larger larva-to-adult survival rate and smaller adult survival rate than control populations, and for the second half of the experimental period the reproductive rate was smaller for cadmium populations than for control populations. Estimation of the density-dependent components suggested that survival from larva to adult depended nonlinearly on larval density and that increased larval density had a positive effect on larval survival at low densities. Furthermore, cadmium generally decreased vital rates. However, the analysis suggested that most of the observed differences in dynamical behavior between control and cadmium populations are related to differences in the density-independent components of the demographic rates, rather than differences in the density-dependent structure.

AB Individuals that live in resource-limited environments are faced with an allocation problem since they generally do not have enough assimilated energy to fuel each of the processes of reproduction, somatic growth, and storage at the physiological maximum rate. Thus, they have to decide on the proportions at which they allocate energy to the various processes. In laboratory experiments and field observations, I found that the common planktonic rotifer Synchaeta pectinata increases the proportion of energy allocated to reproduction (reproductive effort, RE) as food becomes more limited. This change in the allocation scheme along a gradient of food concentrations was inferred from volumetric measurements of egg size and the size of the elliptically shaped ovary. Synchaeta pectinata used the contents of its ovary either for reproduction (increasing the size of the individually and consecutively produced eggs) or for storage (enhancing survival during starvation by resorption of this material). As egg size was relatively constant across food levels, the higher RE at low food concentrations was not due to the fact that Synchaeta channeled a larger absolute quantity of energy into reproduction, but rather that they lowered the threshold size for reproduction of the ovary and hence reproduced earlier. This pattern was also suggested by the results of the field study: when the resource concentrations declined during the study period, the ovary size of field-caught Synchaeta decreased considerably whereas the size of their eggs, collected at the same dates, stayed relatively constant.
   The lower reproductive threshold at low food concentrations resulted in a small ovary size after each egg deposition which implied a twofold cost. First, rotifers with small ovaries were less resistant to starvation because they could resorb only a little material from their ovaries. Second, it took longer for them to produce the next egg since a small ovary took longer to recover in size than a large ovary (for a given food concentration).
   The plasticity in the allocation scheme of Synchaeta pectinata can be interpreted as an adaptive strategy to variable food conditions. By lowering their reproductive threshold when food becomes limited, Synchaeta pectinata increase their chance to produce at least one offspring during their lifetime. In contrast, the higher reproductive threshold under good food conditions results in better maternal condition and, therefore, facilitates future reproduction.

AB Many studies have documented that patterns of species composition change after gap creation, but few have addressed the processes responsible for this change. The idea of competitive reduction, that disturbance removes biomass, reducing competitive intensity and allowing competitively inferior fugitive species to colonize, has been widely accepted but rarely tested. We suggest an alternative hypothesis, competitive change, in which changes associated with disturbance may act to alter the competitive hierarchy, Under these changed conditions, species characteristic of gaps may be competitively superior to species characteristic of undisturbed matrix areas.
   We quantified competitive response ability for survival and relative growth for three target species (Andropogon gerardii, a matrix grass; Coreopsis tripteris, a matrix forb; and Ratibida pinnata, a forb characteristic of gaps) in undisturbed matrix vegetation and in soil mound disturbances in a northern Ohio prairie community. For survival, a weak competitive hierarchy developed following gap creation. In contrast, for relative growth, gap creation shifted a distinct competitive hierarchy to conditions of competitive equivalence. The competitive rankings for survival in gaps were opposite those for growth in matrix conditions, with Andropogon being superior in terms of survival and Coreopsis superior in terms of growth.
   Then, in a factorial design, we teased apart the effects of neighborhood (biomass reduction, size structure, neighbor identity) and abiotic soil changes (mound formation) associated with soil disturbance on these competitive interactions. Abiotic changes associated with mound formation, rather than neighborhood changes, were responsible for the development of the survival hierarchy and the loss of the growth hierarchy following gap creation. When hierarchies formed, matrix species were competitively superior to gap species, supporting the idea of competitive reduction. However, no one matrix species was consistently competitively superior, and under some conditions species were competitive equivalents, partially supporting the idea of competitive change. When disturbance creates conditions of physical stress, as in this case, trade-offs between growth and survival hierarchies may be important determinants of species response.

AB Life history traits in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) vary geographically along a predator assemblage gradient, and held experiments have indicated that the association may be causal; guppies introduced from high predation sites to low predation sites have evolved the phenotype associated with low predation in as few as seven generations. It has long been recognized, however that low predation sites tend to have greater forest canopy cover than high predation sites. Stream differences in canopy cover could translate into stream differences in resource availability, another theoretically potent agent of selection on life history traits. Moreover, new computer simulations indicate that the high predation phenotype would outcompete the low predation phenotype under both mortality regimes. Thus, predation alone may not be sufficient to explain the observed life history patterns,
   Here we show that food availability for guppies decreases as forest canopy cover increases, among six low predation streams in the Northern Range of Trinidad. Streams with less canopy cover received more photosynthetically active light and contained a larger standing crop of algae (the primary food of guppies), as measured by algal pigment, (chlorophylls and carotenoids) on both natural cobble and artificial tile substrates, but did not contain a greater biomass of guppies (per square meter of streambed). Consequently, algae availability for guppies (in micrograms of algal pigments per milligram of guppy) increased with decreasing canopy cover. The biomass of guppies and algae both decreased after a series of floods, with no net effect on algae availability. Field mark-recapture studies revealed that female and juvenile guppies grew faster and that the asymptotic size of mature males was larger, in streams with less canopy cover. Canopy cover explained 84% of the variation among streams in algae availability which, in turn, explained 93% of the variation in guppy growth rates. Laboratory "common garden" experiments indicated that the stream differences in growth and adult male size in the field were largely environmental (nongenetic). These results strongly suggest that stream differences in canopy cover result in consistent stream differences in food availability, independent of predation.
   Our preliminary data indicate that some life history traits (offspring size and litter size) vary genetically along the canopy cover gradient, among low predation streams, in the same direction a's along the predation gradient. Another recent study shows that food availability is higher at high predation sites than at low predation sires, partly as an indirect effect of predators reducing guppy densities. Further research is required to disentangle the direct effects of predation from those of resource availability in the evolution of life histories.

AB The primary objective of this study was to test the: hypothesis that lizards intensify interactions among spider species. The most abundant lizard and web-spider species (Anolis sagrei and Merepeira datona, respectively), were manipulated within field enclosures over a 30-mo period. The design was a 2 x 2 factorial: A. sagrei present and removed, crossed with M. datona present and removed. A. sagrei reduced abundance of Eustala cazieri, the second most abundant web spider, and tended to reduce abundance of all rare spider species combined. M. datona had no significant effect on abundance of E. cazieri or of all rare species combined. In each statistical analysis of abundance, the A. sagrei x M. datona interaction term was not significant, indicating that lizards did not intensify (or reduce) interactions among spider species. Furthermore. data on spider food supply, body length, and web height showed no evidence for two proposed mechanisms in which interactions among spider species are stronger with lizards than without. Thus, this experiment supports the hypothesis that direct predation is the major mechanism by which lizards reduce the abundance and species richness of spiders.

AB Many ecologists have searched for species that contribute strongly to the structure and composition of communities of organisms. It has been speculated that the Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), a generalist brood parasite, is capable of changing songbird communities. Cowbird parasitism may reduce numbers of suitable hosts, i.e., songbirds that accept cowbird eggs and raise cowbird young. In contrast, songbird species that eject cowbird eggs, nest in cavities, feed their nestlings mainly seeds or fruits, or are too big to parasitize, should escape the effects of cowbird parasitism. Thus, cowbirds may change the composition of songbird communities by selectively depressing numbers of suitable host individuals and species. We tested this hypothesis using an existing cowbird removal program in the state of Michigan, USA. This program was designed to protect the endangered Kirtland's Warbler (Dendroica kirtlandii) from cowbird parasitism throughout its 19 200-km(2) breeding range. We compared songbird community composition in stands of young jack pine (Pinus bnnksiana) where cowbirds had been removed for 5-11 yr to communities in Control sites 5-10 km from cowbird traps and >10 km from cowbird traps. We predicted that cowbird Removal sites would support greater songbird richness and evenness and a greater proportion of suitable host vs. unsuitable host individuals relative to Control sites. Results from songbird point counts revealed that species richness and evenness were very similar at cowbird Removal and Control sites and that Removal sites contained only 4.0-8.7% more suitable host individuals than Control sites. Our results suggest that cowbirds do not strongly influence the composition of songbird communities in jack pine forests of Michigan. Several factors may explain a lack of community-wide response to long-term cowbird removal, including the population dynamics of songbirds on a broader scale. We conclude that there is little support for adding cowbirds to the short list of species that can regulate entire communities. Our results have implications for the increasingly widespread use of cowbird removal as a management tool.

AB Migrating animals often divide their journey into alternating phases of migration bouts and stopping over. For investigating many questions of migration ecology it is crucial (1) to estimate the duration of stopover phases, and (2) to test whether animals of different groups differ in their stopover behavior. Using recent advances in capture-recapture statistics, we show how total stopover duration can be estimated from capture-recapture data. The probabilities of immigration are estimated and modeled by recruitment analysis and are converted into the time the animals spent at the stopover place before capture; the probabilities of emigration are estimated and modeled by survival analysis and are converted into the time the animals spent at the stopover place after capture. The sum of the two parts is the total stopover duration. Tests for differences between groups can be addressed by an appropriate model selection procedure. Two examples of migrating passerine birds at a stopover site in Switzerland illustrate this method. Mean total stopover duration was 12.3 d for Reed Warblers and 7.1 d for Reed Buntings. This was considerably higher than values obtained by the minimum stopover duration estimation (6.0 and 4.4 d, respectively). Because of the fundamental weaknesses of the minimum stopover duration estimation, which has been widely used in migration ecology, many findings obtained by this method need to be reconsidered.

AB The common sheep moth, Hemileuca eglanterina (Boisduval), appears to have at least two distinct pheromone types. Male moths from the population in the San Gabriel Mountains of southern California are attracted optimally to a blend of E10,Z12-hexadeca-10,12-dien-1-yl acetate (acetate); E10,Z12-hexadeca-10,12-dien-1-ol (alcohol); and E10,Z12-hexadeca-10,12-dienal (aldehyde), whereas males from the population at Robinson Summit, northwest of Ely, Nevada, are attracted to the two-component blend of alcohol and aldehyde. Populations along the eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada Mountains are composed of individuals of both pheromone types and a type intermediate between the two. Antennae from male moths from the different pheromone types give distinctly different electroantennographic responses when challenged with blends of the pheromone components, with San Gabriel Mountains males showing a large response to acetate and lesser responses to alcohol and aldehyde. In contrast, antennae from Robinson Summit males, which are attracted to lures containing only alcohol and aldehyde, exhibit a large response to alcohol, a smaller response to aldehyde, and minimal or no response to acetate. Male moths from the eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains give antennal responses similar to those of either San Gabriel Mountains or Robinson Summit males. However, eastern Sierra populations also contain an intermediate type that does not occur in areas where the major pheromone types do not occur together. This third type may be a hybrid between the two other pheromone types, and it is attracted in approximately equal numbers to synthetic pheromone lures with and without acetate. The antennae of male moths in all populations tested responded to E10,E12-16:Ac, a major pheromone component of the congener H. nuttalli, which is sympatric with some H. eglanterina populations, and in most H. eglanterina populations tested, the addition of E10,E12-16:Ac antagonized responses to otherwise attractive lure blends. Overall, the existence of different pheromone types in the different H. eglanterina populations may represent a case of reproductive character displacement.

AB Predation among species that compete for resources is widespread. Theory suggests a counterintuitive consequence of such intraguild predation: enrichment of the shared resource, for which the intraguild prey must be the superior competitor, reduces the population size of the intraguild prey and may even cause its extinction. Experiments with bacteria (shared resource) and the ciliates Tetrahymena (intraguild prey) and Blepharisma (intraguild predator) confirmed these expectations. Tetrahymena was the better resource competitor. Grown separately, it persisted at lower levels of enrichment and drove bacterial densities to lower levels than did Blepharisma. When grown together with Blepharisma, Tetrahymena declined in density with increasing enrichment, whereas bacteria and Blepharisma increased. The data thus support the theoretically suggested mechanism as the cause of this pattern: with enrichment, increasing densities of bacteria sustained an increasing predation pressure from Blepharisma on Tetrahymena, which overrode the direct positive effect of bacteria as a food source of Tetrahymena. Generalizing from these results, we speculate that staggered invasions of omnivores followed by extinctions of intermediate prey should contribute to the frequently observed unimodal or neutral responses of species richness and food chain length to increasing productivity.

AB To gain insight into suborganismal mechanisms underlying responses of predators to environmental stress, we examined the effects of temperature and food availability on the physiology and feeding activity of the predatory whelk Nucella ostrina (formerly N. emarginata). Studies were conducted in the mid-low transition zone on rocky reefs at two sites on the Oregon coast: Strawberry Hill (SH) and Boiler Bay (BB). SH is dominated by suspension-feeding invertebrates and their predators, while BB is dominated by macrophytes. In wave-exposed (EX) and wave-protected (PR) habitat,, at each site, we measured air and water temperatures, whelk body temperatures, and indices of physiological condition (malate dehydrogenase [MDH] activities and RNA: DNA ratios) for wild-caught whelks. The influence of food (+/- prey) and thermal conditions (+/- shelter) on prey consumption, physiological performance (oxygen consumption rate), and response to thermal stress (induction of Hsp70-class stress proteins) of whelks was determined in field experiments. Low-tide air temperatures, whelk body temperatures, and biochemical indices of whelk field condition were consistently different between sites (SH > BB) and wave exposures (temperatures: PR > EX, condition: PR < EX). Foraging activity, metabolic rates, and stress protein (Hsp) expression were consistently higher at SH than BB. Respiration rates were lower for all -prey treatments than for +prey treatments however, whelks in -prey +shade treatments had lower Hsp expression and higher respiration rates (an indication of better physiological condition) than whelks in -prey -shade treatments. Most measures of performance suggested that wave-exposed individuals were more physiologically robust than wave-protected individuals. Temporal physiological responses to stress suggested that high levels of heat stress compromise whelk performance later in the summer. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that physiological stress interacts with prey abundance to modify activity of whelks. Detailed studies of the effects of environmental stress on predator-prey interactions are needed to elucidate the relationship between physiological stress and predator-prey interactions. However, present evidence suggests that whelks alter activity (behavioral modification) and physiology (biochemical modification) in ways that lead to differential impacts by these predators on prey populations at different sites.

AB Plants can vary substantially among species in morphological and physiological traits that influence their resistance to herbivores and their quality for herbivore growth and development. Seeds of the desert trees Cercidium floridium and C. microphyllum vary within and among populations in their resistance to, and suitability for, growth and development of larvae of the seed beetle, Stator linibatus. We examined how this variation influences the magnitude of natural selection on the size of eggs laid by beetles and tested whether female beetles can distinguish between seeds of more vs. less suitable trees (within species).),e found that selection favoring large eggs differed substantially between the two tree species (greater on C floridum) and varied substantially among populations of C. floridum and among trees (within populations) of both C. floridum and C. microphyllum. In general, the magnitude of selection favoring large eggs correlated positively with seed coat resistance between tree species, among populations within species, and among trees within populations. Female S. limbatus are capable of distinguishing seeds of the two host species and respond to species differences in selection by laying larger eggs on seeds of C. floridum than on seeds of C. microphyllum. However, despite large variation in seed suitability within populations of trees, females did not preferentially lay eggs on seeds of less resistant trees, nor did they adjust egg size in response to variation in resistance among trees.

AB The internal transformations of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems exert strong controls over nitrogen availability to net primary productivity, nitrate leaching into groundwater, and emissions of nitrogen-based greenhouse gas. Here we report a reductive pathway for nitrogen cycling in upland tropical forest soils that decreases the amount of nitrate susceptible to leaching and denitrification, thus conserving nitrogen in the ecosystem. Using (15)N tracers we measured rates of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) in upland humid tropical forest soils averaging similar to0.6 mug.g(-1).d(-1). Rates of DNRA were three times greater than the combined N(2)O and N(2) fluxes from nitrification and denitrification and accounted for 75% of the turnover of the nitrate pool. To determine the relative importance of ambient C, O(2), and NO(3) concentrations on rates of DNRA, we estimated rates of DNRA in laboratory assays using soils from three tropical forests (cloud forest, palm forest, and wet tropical forest) that differed in ambient C and O(2) concentrations. Rates of DNRA measured in laboratory assays ranged from 0.5 to 9 mug.g(-1).d(-1) in soils from the three different forests and appeared to be primarily limited by the availability of NO(3), as opposed to C or O(2). Tests of sterile soils indicated that the dominant reductive pathway for both NO(2) and NO(3) was biotic and not abiotic. Because NH(4) is the form of N generally favored for assimilation by plants and microbes, and NO(3) is easily lost from the ecosystem, the rapid and direct transformation of NO(3) to NH(4) via DNRA has the potential to play an important role in ecosystem N conservation.

AB Herbivores and pollinators can simultaneously exert selective pressures on plant traits via direct and indirect effects. Net selection on plant traits, such as defensive chemistry, may be difficult to predict from studying either of these interactions in isolation. In this study, alkaloids were manipulated experimentally in the hemiparasitic annual plant Castilleja indivisa (Scrophulariaceae; Indian paintbrush) by growing these parasites with bitter (high-alkaloid) or sweet (low-alkaloid) near-isogenic lines of the host Lupinus albus (Fabaceae) in the field. To evaluate the effect of herbivores. half of the Indian paintbrush plants were randomly assigned to a reduced-herbivory treatment using insecticide, and the other half to a natural-herbivory treatment. Floral traits. bud and fruit herbivory, pollination, alkaloids, and plant performance were measured. These variables were used in a path analysis to dissect the direct and indirect effects of herbivory and pollination on lifetime seed set, and the direct and indirect effects of alkaloids on seed set via herbivory and pollination.
   Bud herbivory and fruit herbivory directly decreased seed production, whereas pollination had a direct positive effect. In addition, bud herbivory had negative indirect effects on seed set by reducing the number of open flowers, which reduced pollinator visits. Alkaloids directly reduced bud herbivory but did not significantly affect pollination or fruit herbivory directly. However, because bud herbivory indirectly reduced seed set by reducing pollinator visits to flowers. alkaloids also had additional indirect benefits for plants by increasing pollination. Overall. the net benefit of alkaloid uptake was due to both reduction in herbivory and an increase in pollinator visits to flowers. This study demonstrates the importance of considering multiple interactions simultaneously when attempting to understand the mechanisms underlying correlations between plant traits and fitness.

AB Long-distance migration in fishes is one of the more spectacular examples of ontogenetic niche switching, yet details are often obscured because of the difficulty in making direct observations on individual migrants. Juvenile emigration and ultimate recruitment to the spawning population were studied retrospectively in American shad (Alosa sapidissima), to look for patterns of size-biased survivorship as a consequence of migration. Adults were collected on or near the spawning grounds in the Hudson River, New York, USA, in spring 1995. Their early life histories were reconstructed by measuring strontium and calcium concentrations in the inner portions of their otoliths, which were deposited when the fish were young-of-the-year (YOY). Sudden elevations of the Sr:Ca ratio were interpreted as seaward migration events, and the physical location of these elevations on the otolith could be related to the age and size at which the fish first emigrated from fresh water. Recruited adults showed distributions of first emigration that were bimodol with respect to size and age, and these patterns were repeated in three of four year classes analyzed. In 1989 and 1990, years when YOY data were available, size distributions of apparently emigrating YOY do not agree with the distributions displayed in the otoliths of returning adults from the same year classes, suggesting that differential mortality had occurred, which was dependent on the timing of emigration. Detailed analysis was possible for the 1990 year class, which showed strong evidence in both sexes of at least two major recruitment bottlenecks-one affecting larvae hatched early, and the second affecting emigrating juveniles hatched from late cohorts. Potential causes of differential mortality on emigrating juveniles include the presence of large predators outside of the Hudson, as well as the presence of hypoxic waters into which the fish may have entered. This study indicates that long-distance migration of juveniles can be a strong factor that restructures the demography of a year class of fish.

AB Fine roots are responsible for a substantial fraction of terrestrial net primary productivity, and a better understanding of fine root production and turnover is crucial to improving global carbon and nutrient cycling models. In most studies, roots less than 1 or 2 mm in diameter ("fine roots") have been treated as structurally and physiologically identical individuals. We used minirhizotron data from 16-yr-old apple (Malus domestica) trees to investigate differences in life span and life history among fine roots whose diameters differed by tenths of a millimeter. We also introduced the use of Cox proportional hazards regression models to assess the effects of multiple covariates on root mortality.
   Overwinter survivorship differed markedly among diameter classes in both years: 3-12% for roots <0.3 mm in diameter, 30% for roots 0.3-0.5 mm in diameter, and 55-60% for roots 0.5-1.1 mm in diameter. Diameter was also shown to be negatively related to the risk of root mortality using a proportional hazards regression (P < 0.0001 in 1994-1995, P < 0.030 in 1995-1996). Smaller diameter fine roots were more likely to be found in densely proliferated patches, while the majority of larger diameter fine roots were found alone or with a single neighboring root. Number of neighbors was shown to be positively correlated (P < 0.0001) with the risk of root mortality in 1994-1995. Pigmentation had a marginally significant (P < 0.053 in 1994-1995, P < 0.078 in 1995-1996) negative effect on the risk of root mortality. Tetrazolium staining of brown fine roots harvested in March of 1996 indicated that 90% were viable. The majority of roots which survived from October to May in both years were >0.5 mm in diameter and brown, and these roots gave rise to new white laterals during the spring root flush. Based on the considerable differences in morphology and life history within the class of roots <1 mm in diameter, we advocate the use of a functional definition for the fine root whenever possible.

AB We present a temporally and spatially explicit mechanistic model of tree seed dispersal by wind, incorporating full stochasticity based on natural variation. The model simulates the dispersal of each individual seed by integrating the temporal effects of climatic conditions on the rate of seed release, and the spatial effects of wind direction and horizontal and vertical velocities, the terminal velocity of seeds (i.e., the constant descent velocity in calm air), and the height of seed release, partitioned into tree height and the distribution of seeds with tree height. The model was tested for two Pinus halepensis stands within the Mediterranean region of Israel, in which seed dispersal has been extensively monitored by seed traps. The predicted dispersal curve verified expectations of a positively skewed leptokurtic distribution and of peak location at some distance from a point source and at zero distance from an area source. Long-distance dispersal events occurred with very low frequency, but given the large seed crop in P. halepensis, even a small fraction should result in a considerable number of seeds dispersed far from their source. The model reliably simulates the observed dispersal pattern in a spatial resolution of 1 m(2) (R(2) between 60% and 90%), as revealed from comparisons of the predicted and observed proportions of seed dispersed to seed traps. A sensitivity analysis using Latin hypercube sampling along with stepwise multiple rank regression showed that the effects of the horizontal and vertical wind velocities on the dispersal distance override those of the biotic factors. This suggests that the synchronization of seed release with favorable winds is the most effective plant-controlled mechanism to increase the distance of dispersal in wind-dispersed species such as P. halepensis.

AB The introduced C-4 bunchgrass; Schizachyrium condensatum, is abundant in unburned, seasonally dry woodlands on the island of Hawaii, where it promotes the spread of fire. After fire, it is partially replaced by Melinis minutiflora, another invasive C-4 grass. Seed bank surveys in unburned woodland showed that Melinis seed is present in locations without adult plants. Using a combination of germination tests and seedling outplant experiments, we tested the hypothesis that Melinis was unable to invade the unburned woodland because of nutrient and/or light limitation. We found that Melinis germination and seedling growth are depressed by the low light levels common under Schizachyrium in unburned woodland. Outplanted Melinis seedlings grew rapidly to flowering and persisted for several years in unburned woodland without nutrient additions, but only if Schizachyrium individuals were removed. Nutrients alone did not facilitate Melinis establishment.
   Competition between Melinis and Schizachyrium naturally occurs when individuals of both species emerge from the seed bank simultaneously, or when seedlings of one species emerge in sites already dominated by individuals of the other species. When both species are grown from seed, we found that Melinis consistently outcompetes Schizachyrium, regardless of light or nutrient treatments. When seeds of Melinis were added to pots with well-established Schizachyrium (and vice versa), Melinis eventually invaded and overgrew adult Schizachyrium under high, but not low, nutrients. By contrast, Schizachyrium could not invade established Melinis pots regardless of nutrient level. A field experiment demonstrated that Schizachyrium individuals are suppressed by Melinis in burned sites through competition for both light and nutrients.
   Overall, Melinis is a dominant competitor over Schizachyrium once it becomes established, whether in a pot or in the field. We believe that the dominance of Schizachyrium, rather than Melinis, in the unburned woodland is the result of asymmetric competition due to the prior establishment of Schizachyrium in these sites. If Schizachyrium were not present, the unburned woodland could support dense stands of Melinis. Fire disrupts the priority effect of Schizachyrium and allows the dominant competitor (Melinis) to enter the system where it eventually replaces Schizachyrium through resource competition.

AB Several models have been suggested to explain variation in parasite richness among populations. Most of these models are based on epidemiological factors (population size, number of host species), biological factors (patch quality, interspecific competition) and the spatial and temporal structure of the host metapopulation. We studied the parasites of 137 rock pool populations of the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna to determine the factors that account for total parasite richness, richness of endoparasites and epibionts, and the presence/absence patterns of individual parasite species. The rock pools of 86 of these populations have been studied since 1982, and it is known how long these pools have been continuously inhabited by Daphnia. By far the best predictor of total parasite richness was host population age, which explained similar to 50% of the variance. While endoparasite richness increased linearly with age over 16 yr, epibiont richness saturated similar to3 yr after pool colonization, which may be explained by the higher dispersal rate of epibionts. After we corrected for host population age, endoparasite richness was positively correlated with the water volume of the rock pool (an estimator for host population size), and epibiont richness was correlated with water conductivity. Pools with lower water conductivity (less influenced by the brackish water of the Baltic Sea) had more epibiont species. The local network size of the host metapopulation (local pool density and number of pools per island) hardly influenced parasite richness. There was also no strong indication of spatial effects (isolation by distance and island effects) on the parasite community. The factors that were correlated with species richness were, however, not the same as those related to the presence of single parasite species. At least for certain epibionts, it appears that presence/absence patterns were influenced by interspecific competition. In conclusion, our analysis shows that predictions derived from epidemiological and temporal models, but not from spatial models, can explain parasite richness patterns, despite apparent conflicting patterns found for individual, parasite species. Our analysis extends the scope of these models, which were previously supported mainly with helminths, to bacteria and protozoa.

AB Differences in root foraging behavior between species have been well documented, but the effects of these differences on belowground competitive ability are only beginning to be studied. Here we report the results of a competition experiment in homogeneous and heterogeneous soils between two species that differ in their ability to acquire nutrients from patchy environments. The perennial grasses Festuca rubra and Anthoxanthum odoratum have comparable growth rates, but results of previous studies with isolated plants designated the latter species as the more effective forager, probably due to its higher physiological plasticity (stronger increase in nutrient uptake rates per unit root mass in enriched nutrient patches). We introduced nutrient soil heterogeneity at two spatial scales. In a fine-grained heterogeneous treatment, the nutrient-rich patches were smaller and more concentrated than in a coarse-grained heterogeneous (checkerboard) treatment. Overall, the level of nutrient availability in these heterogeneous treatments was similar to a third treatment with homogeneous soils. The species were grown in monocultures and mixtures in a standard replacement design during two growing seasons.
   In the homogeneous treatment, the relative competitive ability of F. rubra was higher than of A. odoratum, but F. rubra's advantage declined in the heterogeneous environments, and the relative competitive abilities became the same. Both species produced higher root densities in the richer patches of the fine-grained heterogeneous treatment, but not significantly so in the coarse-grained heterogeneous treatment, and these responses were the same for both species. The root activity of the species was assessed by determining the amount of strontium captured by a species at the end of the experiment, after injecting SrCl2 in the nutrient-rich patches and in equivalent locations in the homogeneous treatment. F. rubra acquired significantly more Sr in the mixtures in the homogeneous treatments, but in the coarse- and fine-grained heterogeneous treatment the nutrient acquisition abilities of the species were equal. These results suggest that a more effective root foraging behavior confers a higher competitive ability in heterogeneous environments. Moreover, the results on root-proliferation and nutrient-acquisition ability suggest that a higher physiological (rather than morphological) plasticity is critical in obtaining a long-term competitive advantage. Analyses of shoot size inequalities suggest that competitive interactions were size-symmetric in homogeneous soil and size-asymmetric in the heterogeneous treatments. However, in the long term, competition becomes more size-symmetric in the heterogeneous soils, consistent with the increasing importance of physiological plasticity.

AB We studied the effect of solar radiation on the winter biology of Short-toed Treecreepers Certhia brachydactyla inhabiting a montane forest in Spain. We hypothesized that, in temperate latitudes of cold winter climate, with low cloudiness and under windless conditions, birds should select sunlit sites (i.e., forest sectors or trunk patches with high levels of exposure to sunlight) to reduce the metabolic cost of thermoregulation. At a within-habitat scale, a hypothesis of "only metabolic benefits" predicts that birds should select sunlit patches at shade temperatures (T-shade) below the birds' lower critical temperature (T-lc). They should shift to a random use of sunlit and shaded patches at temperatures above T-lc. Alternatively, there could be added costs (e.g., travel costs, predation risk) in using sunlit patches. If higher visibility leads to diminished crypsis at sunlit patches ("trade-off with predation risk" hypothesis), birds should select only shaded patches at T-shade values above T-lc, (tu enhance crypsis). They should increasingly select sunlit patches as T-shade decreases below T-lc.
   Treecreepers were selective in their use of jun-shade parches, across different spatial scales. At the among-plots scale, treecreeper abundance was positively related to the availability of sunlit trunks, after we controlled for the effects of tree density, prey availability, and altitude. At the within-plot scale (i.e., selection of foraging patches on thrunks and thick branches), Ivlev's electivity for sunlit patches decreased lineal ly as T-shade increased. Birds preferred to forage on sun-exposed surfaces (electivity >0) when T-shade was lower than similar to4 degreesC, but they tended to forage on shaded surfaces (electivity < 0) when T-shade was higher than similar to9 degreesC. The selection of sunlit trunk patches at low temperatures was not a by-product of higher food availability, because numbers of prey were much less predictable than temperature as a function of trunk exposure (sun vs. shade), and the negative relationship between use of sunlit parches and temperature remained significant when we controlled for the effects of prey availability. Thus, the selection of sunlit patches at low temperatures can be interpreted as a behavioral thermoregulation strategy allowing birds to save energy. However, the Ivlev's electivity for sunlit patches became negative at temperatures a ell below T-lc, and no sunlit patches were used when T-shade approximate to T-lc, which led us to reject the "only metabolic benefits" hypothesis.
   Photometric measurements of treecreeper taxidermic mounts realistically positioned on trunk surfaces, and detection times by simulated (human) predators, suggest that treecreepers were more detectable under direct solar radiation than in deep shade. Crypsis diminished in sunlit patches because of a higher image contrast and an increased difference in perceivable coloration between bird and background, relative to shaded patches. Average detection times were significantly lower for sunlit mounts. Moreover, focal birds scanned more frequently in sunlit than in shaded patches. Thus, the observed temperature-dependent variation in the selection of sunlit substrata is consistent with the "trade-off with predation risk" hypothesis predicting that prey should avoid parches where they are more detectable to potential predators. We interpret the distribution and behavior of treecreepers as indicative of a trade-off between the energy savings (through higher operative temperature and reduced metabolic costs) and the increased risk of predation (through higher visibility and diminished crypsis) afforded by sunlit foraging patches.

AB Matrix population models have become standard tools for the demographic analysis of age- or stage-structured populations. Although age-classified (Leslie) matrix models make maximum use of age-specific demographic data, age at first reproduction, which has been suggested to be an important life-history variable, does not appear as an explicit parameter in these models. Consequently, the sensitivity of population growth rate to changes in age at first reproduction cannot be calculated using standard techniques. Age-specific demographic data to parameterize age-structured models are difficult to collect, and models that can be parameterized with partial demographic data ("partial life-cycle models") have been developed. Partial life-cycle models are based on life-history stages, and these models can also be used to calculate sensitivity of population growth rate to changes in various life-history variables, including ages at first and last reproduction. Here, we present a partial life-cycle model appropriate for situations where demographic data are collected immediately after the birth pulse (post-breeding census). We present methods of parameterizing the partial life-cycle model, and derive formulas for calculating the sensitivity of the population growth rate to changes in model parameters, including ages at first and last reproduction. We analyzed life-table data for several species of mammals using the partial life-cycle model and found that results of our partial life-cycle model compare favorably with those obtained from the corresponding age-classified models.

AB We determined the influence of nutrient availability on the mechanisms used by plants to acquire nitrogen and phosphorus from the soil. Extracellular acid phosphatase production, mycorrhizal colonization, and N and P uptake capacities were measured in control, N-, and P-fertilized forests in three sites that varied in nutrient status from N limited to relatively fertile to P limited. Nitrogen fertilization increased extracellular phosphatase activity in all sites. Phosphorus additions consistently reduced phosphatase activity, mycorrhizal colonization, and P uptake capacity across sites. Our results indicate that these plants efficiently allocate resources to nutrient acquisition as suggested by an economic model. Investment in acquisition of a nutrient was greatest when that nutrient was limiting to growth, and plants appeared to allocate excess N to construction of extracellular phosphatases to acquire P This increase in phosphatase production with N fertilization implies that even P-limited systems might respond to N deposition with greater productivity.

AB Riparian ecotones at lakeshore edges are prominent features on the heterogeneous boreal forest landscape. We introduce a new method (the critical values approach): which incorporates inherent variability in interior forest, to quantify distance of edge influence at lakeshore forest edges. We use this method to examine the variation in forest structure and composition along the lakeshore forest edge-to-interior gradient in the mixed-wood boreal forest. Our objectives were: (1) to quantify distance of edge influence for forest structure and composition at lakeshore forest edges; and (2) to investigate spatial pattern in vegetation along the edge-to-interior gradient. Trees, coarse woody material, saplings, shrubs, and herbs were sampled in plots at varying distances along 200-m transects established perpendicular to lakeshore forest edges. Distance of edge influence was determined by comparing mean values at different positions along the transect to critical values established from a randomization test of interior forest data. The spatial pattern of four selected species along the edge-to-interior gradient was assessed using split moving window analysis and wavelet analysis. The results suggest that a distinct lakeshore forest edge community exists. This community was similar to 40 m wide and was characterized by greater structural diversity, larger amounts of coarse woody material, and more saplings and mid-canopy trees than interior forest. Distance of edge influence for understory composition was generally greater than for forest structure. Patterns of response for different species along the edge-to-interior gradient were related to shade tolerance. Lakeshore forest edges are distinct landscape elements, but their prominence depends on the reference forest, species, and scale.

AB Two broad classes of arthropod natural enemies attack insect herbivores: specialists and generalists. The tight dynamical linkage of specialist natural enemies and their prey may make the specialists able to respond numerically to, and perhaps suppress, herbivore outbreaks. Because generalist predators may attack not only herbivores, but also the herbivores' specialist natural enemies, generalist predators may disrupt control of herbivore populations rather than contribute to it.
   We examined interactions between pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum), a specialist parasitoid wasp (Aphidius ervi) that attacks the aphids, and a common generalist predator, carabid beetles (primarily Pterostichus melanarius). In two held experiments in alfalfa, we manipulated carabid densities to measure their direct (through predation) and indirect (through intraguild predation on A. ervi) impact on aphid population dynamics. The first experiment was initiated when plants were short (following cutting), and carabid predation of aphids led to an immediate reduction in aphid densities. This reduction was short-lived, however, because carabids reduced parasitism, leading to higher aphid population growth rates. Therefore, although the immediate direct effect of carabids was a reduction in aphid densities, this was offset in the longer term by the indirect effect of carabids disrupting the control of aphids by parasitoids. The second experiment was initiated after plants had regrown following cutting. When plants were tall, carabids had no direct impact on aphid densities. Nonetheless, the slow indirect effect of carabids on aphid densities through reduction in parasitism still occurred, leading to higher aphid population growth rates in the presence of carabids. Additional laboratory experiments demonstrated that carabids are able to climb into plants and prey upon the immobile parasitoid pupae ("mummies"), whereas antipredator behaviors of the aphids protect them from predation by carabids when plants are tall.
   Overall, carabid predation caused an immediate but ephemeral decrease in aphid density. In contrast, the indirect positive effect on aphid density caused by reducing parasitism developed later but persisted longer Thus the generalist carabid primarily acted as an intraguild predator, interrupting aphid population control by the specialist parasitoid.

AB Grime's model of plant species richness was used as a basis for examining how local and regional processes interact in the regulation of the species richness of vascular plants growing on individual Carer stricta (tussock sedge) tussocks in New Hampshire, USA. We first used a correlational study of 71 tussocks in five marshes to examine the relationships between species richness and standing crop + leaf litter biomass. We found humped (unimodal) relationships with a wide variation in peak species richness per tussock among sites. Then, using a factorial design involving 167 tussocks in three marshes, we performed Carer stricta standing crop removals, leaf litter removals, and seed additions to examine how these factors interacted to influence species richness. The results of both studies supported Grime's model, which implies that the magnitude of local competitive effects on plant species richness is dependent on regional propagule availability.

AB Although it is often assumed that root dynamics are similar to leaf dynamics in relation to nutrient availability, this hypothesis is rarely tested. Using sequential soil coring and a decomposition experiment, patterns of fine-root (<2 mm diameter) biomass, belowground net primary productivity, and root turnover rates were examined over a l-yr period in three sites along a forest chronosequence in the Hawaiian Islands. These sites form a natural fertility gradient but have similar species composition, climate, and geology. The youngest site (300 yr old) was low in N availability, the oldest site (4.1 X 10(6) yr old) was low in P availability, and the intermediate-aged site (20 000 yr old) was higher in both N and P. The youngest and oldest sites also contained long-term fertilization plots that were fertilized with N or P, or were unfertilized (control).
   Along the natural fertility gradient, the oldest site generally differed from the other two sites; this site had the greatest standing stock of live root mass, the greatest root length density, the lowest belowground net primary productivity (BNPP), and the slowest root turnover rate. The 300-yr-old and 20 000-yr-old sites were similar in all of these variables, except that root turnover was slightly faster at the 300-yr-old site. The response of fine roots to fertilization was consistent with the response along the natural fertility gradient. Despite N limitation to aboveground growth at the 300-yr-old site, fertilization had small effects on root variables, with the only significant effects being a small increase in the standing stock of live root biomass in N-fertilized plots and an increase in root tissue P concentrations in P-fertilized plots. In contrast, fertilization at the 4.1 x 10(6) yr-old site altered root dynamics more than fertilization at the 300-yr-old site. In the P-fertilized plots, P concentrations increased, BNPP tended to be greater, and root turnover rates increased. These results suggest that root dynamics differ dramatically between ecosystems low in N and ecosystems low in P, even though each system is regarded as "infertile." N availability had a smaller effect on root dynamics than did P availability, suggesting that the simple dichotomy between fertile and infertile sites that is often evoked to explain plant characteristics may be unjustified.

AB Mathematical models are used to explore the evolutionary and demographic consequences of size-selective harvesting and natural selection in populations with discrete, nonoverlapping generations. We specify the harvesting intensity and size selectivity in terms of both the phenotypic criterion for harvesting and the demographic goal of harvesting. The phenotypic criterion is defined by a threshold that specifies the minimum size of individuals harvested, while the demographic goal defines the desired catch or escapement from the harvest. Models use either a constant phenotypic threshold, or a variable phenotypic threshold that moves each year to remain a fixed distance from the mean size prior to harvest. Demographic goals are defined as a desired yield or escapement, measured in abundance or biomass. We find that all combinations of phenotypic criteria and demographic goals can produce evolutionary changes in equilibrium mean size and abundance when harvesting is size selective. Reductions in mean size are more severe under harvesting scenarios for which it is not possible to fully satisfy the demographic goals of harvesting at equilibrium. Models with a variable phenotypic threshold always produce a characteristic equilibrium for mean size and abundance for a given set of harvesting and natural selection parameters, regardless of the initial population characteristics. For some combinations of parameters, constant-threshold models produce alternative equilibria for the mean size and abundance. Our results suggest that the evolutionary effects of selective harvesting warrant consideration in long-term conservation and management planning.

AB Introduced species represent major threats to native and natural biodiversity. On the other hand, biologists may increase the understanding of ecological interactions by following communities during establishment of exotic species. Accordingly, feeding ecology and habitat use were studied in native whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) and recently invading vendace (C. albula) in two lake localities situated 50 km apart within the subarctic Pasvik River system, northern Norway and Russia. Whitefish originally dominated the native fish communities of both lakes. The recent invasion and successive downstream expansion of vendace allowed comparisons between two sites: one in which the influence of the new potential competitor on the native fish species was weak, and one in which the influence was strong. In the downstream lake vendace was recorded for the first time at the time of the study, and only in small numbers, whereas in the upstream lake vendace had established a high population density and was the dominant fish species in the pelagic zone. No vertical segregation in pelagic habitat use was found between the two fish species in either lake. In the downstream lake both whitefish and vendace fed exclusively on zooplankton and had almost identical diets. In the upstream lake. in contrast, whitefish fed predominantly on zoobenthos and surface insects, while vendace fed mainly on zooplankton. Thus. the strong presence of vendace as a specialized planktivore reduced the availability of zooplankton as prey for the more generalist whitefish. The food segregation between the two fish species in the upstream lake was apparently interactive and caused by a strong asymmetrical competition for zooplankton, vendace being the superior species. The ecological consequences (including reduced zooplankton size and species diversity, alteration of the pelagic food web, and eutrofication as a possible cascading effect on the primary production) of the vendace invasion in the Pasvik watercourse are considerable, even after a few years. and are likely to proceed and intensify in the future.

AB Methods used to estimate home ranges from point locations are based either on densities of locations or on link distances between locations. The density-based methods estimate ellipses and contours. The other class minimizes sums of link distances, along edges of polygons or to range centers or between locations. We propose a new linkage method, using nearest-neighbor distances first to exclude outlying locations and then to define a multinuclear outlier-exclusive range core (OEC) by cluster analysis. The assumption behind exclusion of outliers. that movements inside and outside range cores involve different activities, was supported by data from radio-tagged Common Buzzards (Buteo buteo). We compared the new method with other techniques by using location data from each of 28 goshawks, 114 buzzards, 138 gray squirrels, and 14 red squirrels. Range structure statistics from OECs showed marked differences between species in numbers and extent of core nuclei. Range analysis displays illustrated relationships of range area with age categories, food supply. population density, and body mass within species. The OECS gave highly significant results in three of five within-species tests, perhaps because animal movements in these cases were affected by coarse-grained habitat boundaries. When movements were likely to have been influenced by diffuse social interactions and foraging for scattered prey, the most significant results were from density-based estimators, especially kernel contours that had been optimized by least-squares cross validation. We recommend use of both density and linkage estimators of home range until a basis for a priori choices has been established.

AB Availability of food may play a number of different dynamical roles in rodent-vegetation systems. Consideration of a suite of rodent-vegetation models, ranging from very simple ones to a model of medium complexity tailored to a specific system (brown lemmings ar point Barrow, Alaska, USA), suggested several general principles. If vegetation grows logistically following an herbivory event (a standard assumption of previously advanced models for herbivore-plant interactions), then almost any biologically reasonable combinations of parameters characterizing rodent-vegetation systems would result in population cycles. We argue, however, that the assumption of logistic growth of the food supply may be appropriate for only a few species, such as moss-eating lemmings. The dynamics of food supply for many arvicoline (microtine) rodents may be better described by a "linear initial regrowth" model, which exhibits globally stable dynamics. If this is so, quantitative interactions with food supply are unlikely to explain multiannual population cycles for most boreal or temperate voles. The role of food in population dynamics, however, is not limited to its potential to generate cycles. A tritrophic model including vegetation, rodents, and their specialist predators suggests that food limitation may provide direct density dependence needed for sustained oscillations in this system (which is usually modeled by a phenomenological logistic term in the prey equation).
   We relate the general theory that we developed to one specific system where we have enough data to arrive at reasonable estimates for most of the parameters-brown lemmings at Point Barrow. The Barrow model exhibits oscillations of the approximately correct period and amplitude, thus giving some theoretical support to the food hypothesis. Nevertheless, we suggest that this result should be treated cautiously because key events explaining the population cycle in the model occur during winter, but winter biology of lemmings is still poorly understood.

AB We examined how autotomy-induced shifts in behavior of a diurnal lizard (Lampropholis guichenoti) and two natural snake predators influence the outcome of predatory interactions. During staged encounters in seminatural enclosures, we estimated the consumption order of lizards with recently autotomised tails ("tailless") and intact tails ("tailed"). Tail loss increased a lizard's chances of being consumed first by a diurnal snake (Demansia psammophis). but not by a nocturnal species (Rhinoplocephalus nigrescens). We presented snakes with an inert tailed lizard vs, tailless lizard, scoring which was consumed first. Neither predator actively selected tailless prey. We quantified variation in the behavior of tailed and tailless lizards that determines the outcome of predator-prey interactions. Tailless lizards were not easier to detect visually or via chemoreception than were tailed lizards. Instead, the higher consumption rate of tailless lizards by the diurnal snake probably reflects reduced locomotor performance, and their tendency to flee sooner from approaching predators (thereby eliciting attack by this snake). In contrast, rail presence or absence did not determine a lizard's chances of detection by the nocturnal snake. Thus, tail loss can induce shifts in behavior of lizards, affecting their later chances of being consumed by some predators. but not by others.

AB Laboratory studies are increasingly indicating that the quality of nutrient-limited algae is suboptimal for zooplankton production. However, little is known about how quality is affected by nutrient limitation of phytoplankton in more natural situations. To test for phosphorus (P) limitation of zooplankton growth under realistic food conditions, we performed a set of 5-d experiments using Daphnia dentifera and suspended particulate matter (seston) from three lakes at the Experimental Lakes Area (Ontario, Canada). Neonate Daphnia fed for 6 h per day on freshly collected seston enriched or unenriched with PO, and spent the rest of the day feeding on unaltered natural seston. PO, enrichment did not affect food abundance or concentrations and composition of essential fatty acids but dramatically lowered seston C:P ratio and significantly stimulated Daphnia growth. These results demonstrate that, even with field-collected seston, the effects of algal phosphorus limitation can extend to herbivores through reduced food quality.

AB Increases in tree biomass may be an important sink for CO2 as the atmospheric concentration continues to increase. Tree growth in temperate forests is often limited by the availability of soil nutrients. To assess whether soil nutrient limitation will constrain forest productivity under high atmospheric CO2, we studied the changes in forest litter production and nutrient cycling in a maturing southern U.S, loblolly pine-hardwood forest during two years of free-air CO2 enrichment. The objective of this paper is to present data on the chemistry of green leaves and leaf litter, nutrient-retranslocation efficiency, aboveground litter production, whole-system nutrient-use efficiency, decomposition, and N availability in response to forest growth under elevated CO2.
   The chemical composition of green leaves and leaf litter was largely unaffected by elevated CO2. Green-leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations were not significantly lower under elevated CO2. N and P retranslocation from green leaves did not increase under elevated CO2; therefore, leaf litter N and P concentrations were not significantly lower under elevated CO2. The concentrations of carbon, lignin, and total nonstructural carbohydrates in litter were not significantly different under elevated CO2.
   Total aboveground litterfall increased significantly with CO2 fumigation, The increase in litterfall was due to significant increases in loblolly pine leaf litter and bark production. The mass of leaves from deciduous species did not increase with CO2 fumigation, Whole-system nutrient-use efficiency (aboveground litterfall/nutrient content of litterfall) did not increase as a consequence of forest growth under elevated CO2, but N and P fluxes from vegetation to the forest floor increased significantly. During the second year of CO2 fumigation, the flux of N and P to the forest floor in litterfall increased by 20% and 34%, respectively.
   The rate of mass loss during one year of decomposition was unaffected by "litter type" (whether the litter was produced under ambient or elevated CO,), nor by the "site" of decomposition (whether the litter was decomposed in the ambient or elevated CO, plots). N was immobilized in litter during decomposition, whereas P was mineralized.
   There was no consistent effect of litter type or site on nutrient dynamics in decomposing litter. There was no significant effect of elevated CO2 on the pool size of inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-) in the top 7.5 cm of mineral soil. The rate of net N mineralization and nitrification in mineral soil was not significantly different between treatment and control plots.
   Identifying the source of the nutrients lost in litterfall is critical to the long-term potential growth Stimulation of forests under elevated CO2. If the nutrients lost from biomass come from storage (e.g., the movement of nutrients from wood to leaves), then the increase in litter production should decrease over time as slowly replenished nutrient reserves are exhausted. If the nutrients lost in plant litter are replaced by uptake from soils, then it is possible (1) that trees acquire soil nutrients at a rate commensurate with growth stimulated by elevated CO2; and (2) that forest productivity will be stimulated by elevated CO2 in the long term.

AB The separation between staminate and pistillate phases in protandrous, long-lived hermaphroditic flowers results :in a seasonal shift in sex ratio from a pure male to a pure female flower population. In theory, temporal sex ratio associated with dichogamy may affect pollination, promoting the evolution of sexual specialization in plants when pollinator visitation does not limit seed output. Alstroemeria aurea, a perennial herb native to the temperate forests of southern South America, bears strongly protandrous flowers. Over a three-year period, I assessed the influence of seasonal changes in flower sex ratio and pollinator abundance on the pollination dynamics of this plant species.
   Workers of Bombus dahlbomii accounted for >90% of all visits to A. aurea flowers and were the most efficient pollinators on a per-visit basis. As the season progressed, pollen loads carried by bumble bees decreased by almost one order of magnitude, and the amount of pollen deposited per visit decreased as well from >40 to <4 pollen grains from the beginning to the end of the flowering season. As flowering patches became more female, the number of male-phase flowers visited uninterruptedly during each bumble bee foraging bout decreased, while the number of sequential visits to female-phase Aowers increased. A laboratory experiment of manipulating dried bumble bees showed that the number of male- and female-phase flowers visited in uninterrupted sequence strongly influences the amount of pollen deposited on a flower's stigma. Pollen deposition in this experiment closely mimicked the relationship between sex ratio and the observed seasonal decline in per-visit pollen deposition in the field.
   Because overall rate of bumble bee visitation increased monotonically over the flowering season, total pollen receipt per flower also increased during the first half of the season. Nevertheless, pollen deposition decreased during the second half of the season when visitation rates saturated pollen removal, and low pollen availability associated with an increasingly female-biased sex ratio apparently became the limiting factor in pollen transfer.
   Despite pronounced seasonal changes in pollinator and pollination levels, comparisons of seed output between open- and hand-pollinated flowers showed no evidence that seed production was ever limited by total pollen receipt. Because flower sex ratio influenced pollinator visitation and pollination patterns, and pollinator availability did not limit seed output, protandry should favor the evolution of female and male specialists flowering at the tails of the flowering season. Neither unisexuality nor any other form of sexual polymorphism is found in A. aurea, however. Likewise, I found no evidence that plants might be compensating for a seasonal shift in sex ratio through differential allocation into pollen and ovule production within flowers or to relative duration of male and female sexual phases. These results suggest that a seasonal shift in operational sex ratio within a dichogamous species can profoundly affect pollination without necessarily driving the evolution of floral polymorphism.

AB Current theories differ in their predictions concerning the effects of interspecific interactions on species growth and distribution along environmental gradients. In this study, we examined the influence of competition on species composition across a salinity gradient. This work involved three common fresh and brackish marsh species. The three species, Spartina patens, Sagittaria lancifolia, and Panicum hernitomon, differ in salt tolerances but are commonly found in overlapping zones across coastal marsh gradients in the southeastern United States. Plants were grown in a greenhouse under four salinity treatments (0, 2, 4, and 8 g/kg), in monocultures and in three-species mixtures. Data from the monocultures and mixtures were used to examine the importance of competition in regulating community composition and species' growth. Results for individual species were significantly different when grown in monoculture vs, the three-species mixture. While with increasing salinity community dominance shifted toward the most salt-tolerant species, Spartina parens, competition was found to alter community composition equally over all salinities. However, the responses of individual species demonstrated a very different pattern; the relative importance of competition in influencing individual growth differed substantially depending on the salinity tolerances of species. These results support the contention that, as abiotic stress increases, competition becomes less of a limiting factor in regulating the abundance of a species. However, the role of competition at the community level is the sum of the individual species' responses and may or may not vary with the level of abiotic stress.

AB Stoloniferous rosette plants may show horizontal and vertical foraging responses, such as changes in branching frequency, stolon internode length, leaf length, and height growth of stolons. To study whether such plastic foraging responses constitute an adaptation to heterogeneity in competition, we studied genetic variation in and fitness consequences of plastic foraging responses in the stoloniferous lake-shore plant Ranunculus reptans. Because plastic foraging responses are likely to have been more strongly selected for in heterogeneous environments, we used 15 genotypes from competitive, heterogeneous microhabitats and 15 from competition-free, homogeneous microhabitats from Lake Constance (central Europe).
   We planted vegetatively propagated rosettes of the 30 genotypes (totaling 236 rosettes) into a greenhouse environment with spatially heterogeneous competition. Four replicates of each genotype were planted into the competition-free halves of experimental trays, and four other replicates into the halves with the naturally co-occurring grass Agrostis stolonifera.
   We found significant variation among genotypes in vertical and horizontal foraging responses. In line with the hypothesis of adaptive plasticity, genotypes from the competitive heterogeneous microhabitats more strongly increased the vertical angle of the first stolon internode (126%) and the specific stolon length (166%) in response to competition than genotypes from the competition-free homogeneous microhabitats. Moreover, we found that genotypes that were more plastic in the vertical angle of the first stolon internode, stolon height, and specific internode length produced more rosettes and flowers than less plastic genotypes (all selection gradients for plasticity > 0.316).
   Our findings strongly suggest that plastic foraging responses constitute an adaptation to environmental heterogeneity, at least in the stoloniferous R. reptans.

AB Theory suggests that a population in a patchy environment will persist longer than in a homogeneous environment. Persistence of the population is necessary for the evolution of resistance, which here occurs under strong selection pressure from heavy metal pollution. Here we investigate the factors promoting persistence and check the theoretical expectation that, given persistence. evolution will occur fastest under high selection pressure and small metapopulation size. We report a replicated study of the metapopulation dynamics of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster undergoing evolutionary change over 12 generations in patchy environments. Environments were composed of two types of patch: polluted and unpolluted, the former being contaminated with cadmium. Metapopulation performance was examined in relation to patch connectivity and in relation to the ratio of polluted to unpolluted patches. The ancestral population contained a small proportion of genes that allowed improved performance on the polluted patches containing cadmium.
   An initial experiment showed that metapopulation connectivity was essential for metapopulation persistence in polluted patches; without it, extinct patches could not be recolonized. By the twelfth generation the resistant allele had spread in all of the metapopulations, so that all evolved resistance to cadmium. This evolution of resistance substantially increased carrying capacity in polluted patches, and these carrying capacities were in fact indistinguishable from those of unpolluted patches, so that eventual metapopulation sizes did not differ between treatments. Contrary to expectation, evolution took longer in metapopulations living in environments containing more polluted patches, as measured by time taken to achieve full patch occupancy.
   A metapopulation structure of connected patches was essential for the evolution of resistance, and systems with a high proportion of polluted patches evolved slower than systems containing less polluted patches. With increasing landscape fragmentation, the longterm survival of localized and endangered species may depend on our understanding of metapopulation evolution and dynamics in patchy environments.

AB The population ecology of clonal plants depends on the number and distribution of ramets formed during growth. Variation in clonal reproduction has previously been explained by variation in effects of abiotic resource heterogeneity and by plant genotypic variation. Different co-occurring species of the mutualistic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been shown to differentially alter growth traits of Prunella vulgaris, which we hypothesize would lead to changes in clonal reproduction. Two experiments were carried out to test whether different co-occurring mycorrhizal fungi significantly influence clonal reproduction of P. vulgaris, whether this effect also occurs when P. vulgaris is growing in an artificial plant community, and how the effects compare with plant genotype effects on clonal growth of P. vulgaris.
   In the first experiment, the number of ramets of P. vulgaris, growing in a plant community of simulated calcareous grassland, was significantly affected by inoculation with different mycorrhizal fungi. The number of ramets produced by P. vulgaris differed by a factor of up to 1.8 with different mycorrhizal fungi. The fungal effects on the number of new ramets were independent of their effects on the biomass of P. vulgaris.
   In a second experiment, 17 different genotypes of P. vulgaris were inoculated with different mycorrhizal fungi. There were significant main effects of genotypes and mycorrhizal fungi on clonal reproduction of P. vulgaris. The effect of different mycorrhizal fungi contributed more than the effect of plant genotype to variation in size and ramet production. However, mean stolon length and spacer length, which determine the spatial arrangement of ramets, were only significantly affected by plant genotype. There were no mycorrhizal fungal X plant genotype interactions on clonal growth of P. vulgaris indicating that there is no obvious evidence that selection pressures would favor further coevolution between P. vulgaris and mycorrhizal fungal species.
   In natural communities plants can be colonized by several different AMF at the same time. The effect of the mixed AMF treatment on the growth and clonal reproduction of P. vulgaris could not be predicted from the responses of the plants to the single AMF To what extent, however, the patterns of colonization by different AMF differ among plants in a natural community is unknown.
   Since the effects of AMF on growth and clonal reproduction occur on a population of P. vulgaris in a microcosm plant community and because the effects are also as great as those caused by plant genotypic variation, we conclude that the effects are strong enough to potentially affect population size and variation of clonal plants in communities.

AB In a Neotropical pasture, I predicted that two characteristics of trees, type of fruit produced and amount of shade cast, would affect recruitment and growth of woody plants underneath them. I also predicted that woody plants that persisted in active pasture would affect the species assemblages under trees after pasture abandonment. To investigate these hypotheses, I examined the assemblages of recruits under several types of trees in active pasture and also under similar trees that were fenced off (enclosed) to simulate abandoned pasture. The trees were Ficus spp. (fleshy fruits, deep shade), Pentaclethra macroloba (dry fruits, deep shade), Cecropia. spp. (fleshy fruits, sparse shade), and Cordia alliodora (dry fruits, sparse shade). Recruitment into "open" pasture plots (i.e., without trees) was also examined. In active pasture, the species assemblage of woody recruits depended on the tree under which they grew. The assemblage under Ficus was dense and diverse, under Cecropia and Cordia. it was moderately dense and diverse, in open pasture it was sparse and species-poor, and under Pentaclethra it was dominated by its own seedlings. These patterns were found in the enclosed pasture as well, apparently because woody plants that had survived in the active pasture continued to grow after "abandonment." However, after enclosure, many new plants also became established, such that the enclosed pasture plots had almost twice as many woody plants and species as the active pasture plots. Growth of woody plants was most rapid under trees with the least shade (Cecropia, Cordia) and in open pasture. In contrast, growth of recruits was slower under the much shadier Ficus, and thus, in the initial stages of succession, Ficus appeared not to be as important a "recruitment focus" for woody plants. Growth of recruits under the equally shady Pentaclethra was also slow, but Pentaclethra seedlings readily established just outside the canopies of parent trees, where they grew quickly and created dense, monospecific stands, The results of this study suggest that patterns of early succession to forest after pasture abandonment will depend on the kinds of trees found in the pasture. Persistent woody recruits under trees in active pasture constitute sources of advanced regeneration that will substantially affect forest succession after pasture abandonment.

AB A tridimensional allometric model of self-thinning was tested in a tunicate population of Pyura praeputialis in the Antofagasta Bay. northern Chile. The theory tested follows the bidimensional allometric theory of Osawa and Allen for the self-thinning rule proposed for plants. except that in addition to mean individual mass we included three new concepts: the number of layers (an equivalent of the leaf area index, [LAI] used in plants). the effective unit area, and the density per unit effective area. We assumed constant tunicate mass per effective unit area and allometry for mean dimensions of the population. The tridimensional model can be reduced to a bidimensional one if density is expressed as the density per unit effective area, which corresponds to the number of individuals relative to the effective area occupied by individuals when they conform a monolayer. The model allows for random sampling and rules out the selection for samples or stands at maximum crowding. The self-thinning of P. praeputialis through a tridimensional model showed an exponent of -1.518 (95% CI, -1.635 to -1.401) for mean tunicate visceral mass, and an exponent of -1.489 (95% CI, -1.588 to -1.390) for the corrected bidimensional model. The two exponents were identical to those predicted from tridimensional allometric theory. The results of this new approach increase the variance explained in comparison to that of classical bidimensional models.

AB Stream landscapes are highly variable in space and time and, like terrestrial landscapes, the resources they contain are patchily distributed. Organisms may disperse among patches to fulfill life-history requirements, but biotic and abiotic factors may limit patch or locality occupancy. Thus, the dynamics of immigration and extinction determine, in part, the local structure of assemblages. We sampled fishes and stream habitat at 12 localities for two years (96 samples) to examine the deterministic nature of immigration and extinction processes in stream fish assemblages. Mean immigration rates for assemblages were highest at large stream localities. where the pool of potential immigrants was largest. Mean extinction rates were highest where variability in the flow regime was high, though local refugia appeared to modify the extinction process at one locality. Significant nested subset patterns in species composition occurred over time for 7 of the 12 localities. The strength of the nesting was associated with mean immigration and extinction rates. Higher extinction rates corresponded to stronger nestedness, whereas higher immigration rates were associated with weaker nestedness. Across all species, both immigration and extinction rates were strongly associated with mean abundance. Species with high local abundances had higher immigration rates and lower extinction rates than did species with low local abundances. There were no significant associations between trophic guild or body size and immigration and extinction rate. This work supports the hypothesis that immigration and extinction rates for assemblages are predictable along environmental gradients, and that species are less prone to local extinction and more prone to colonize areas when they maintain high local abundances. The extinction process in local assemblages can be a highly ordered event leading to strong nested subset patterns. but immigration appears to be more stochastic.

AB We investigated the selective advantage of continuous variation of awn length in the clonal grass Hyparrhenia diplandra (Poaceae) in a West African tropical savanna (Ivory Coast) that burns every year. This species is apomictic, so all seeds produced by one mother plant have the same genotype H. diplandra produces diaspores with a hygroscopic awn whose length varies within and among plants. In other grass species awns play a significant role in secondary dispersal on the ground and in seed burial. Using an ex perimental approach, we quantified (1) the environmental and genetic components of awn length variation, (2) the influence of awn length variation on seed burial depth, (3) the effect of awn length on seed germination and seedling survival rates in burned and unburned plots, and (4) the potential role of fire intensity in selecting diaspores with different awn lengths.
   Awn length varied from 35 to 70 mm and was highly heritable (h(2) = 0.63). Variation within individuals was not related to flowering phenology or flower position on the inflorescence. Awn length was significantly and positively correlated with seed burial depth. The range of depths from where buried seeds were recovered varied between 0 and 7.4 cm; this represents the layer where high soil temperature was recorded during fires in both field and experimental conditions. Thus, short-awned seeds were more likely to be affected by soil temperature elevation during a fire than were long-awned seeds. During two consecutive years, a significant relationship between mean seedling survival and moan awn length was only found in 3 ha of naturally burned plots. No such significant relationship existed in experimentally unburned plots in 1997 or 1998. In burned plots, the relationship between mean awn length and mean proportion of surviving seedlings was negative in 1997, while in 1998 the same relationship was positive. In natural conditions, fire intensity was significantly different between years, and variation in fin intensity could be related to between-year differences in climatic conditions and the amount of biomass that was available for burning. Furthermore, seed germination probability increased when seed burial depth increased and when elevation of the soil temperature was moderate (< 100 degreesC).
   We suggest that, depending on fire intensity, different awn lengths are selected because of different soil temperatures, with very intense fires selecting for long-awned diaspores. Since fire intensity is unpredictable from year to year, this maintains the continuous variation of awn length within populations. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity select fur different clones that have contrasting awn morphologies.

AB Although theory predicts that large-scale factors will constrain small-scale interactions, the potential for small-scale events to impact large-scale patch structure is less clear. We examined experimentally the effects of urine deposition, a highly localized event, on small- and large-scale vegetation structure and spatial variation in tallgrass prairie. The response by vegetation to urine deposition may be mediated by grazing. Thus, we also determined the probability of urine patches serving as foci for grazing events by bison. Likelihood of bison grazing was much higher on vs. off urine patches, and grazed areas initiated on urine patches expanded well beyond the area of urine deposition. Abundance of four common graminoid species, and of all graminoids combined, increased on urine patches in ungrazed prairie. while the abundance of Andropogon gerardii and total graminoids decreased on urine patches in grazed prairie. The abundance of Aster ericoides, and all forbs combined, increased on urine patches in ungrazed, but not in grazed, prairie. Species richness and Shannon-Weiner diversity increased on urine patches in ungrazed prairie but were not affected by urine treatment in grazed prairie. Total spatial variance of graminoids increased relative to controls in response to urine treatment, grazing, and the combination of these treatments. For forbs, total variance increased marginally compared to controls only in response to urine treatment in ungrazed prairie. In combination, urine patches plus gracing produced unique large-scale patch structure compared to urine patches in ungrazed prairie. The most important impact of urine patches on community structure resulted from preferential grazing of urine patches by bison, which increases both the size and severity of the grazed area. Urine patches are thus an trample of a small-scale perturbation that generates larger-scale patch structure in tallgrass prairie.

AB Hypotheses about the origin of vegetation pattern formation in semi-arid areas around the world almost all include a common feature of semi-arid areas: the presence of a positive feedback between plant density and water infiltration. We investigate whether this positive feedback and the spatial redistribution of runoff water are sufficient to explain vegetation pattern formation. For this purpose, we analyze a spatially explicit model consisting of partial differential equations using a method for demonstrating pattern formation (Turing analysis). Our analysis reveals that pattern formation can occur in semi-arid areas given only the positive feedback between plant density and local water infiltration coupled with the spatial redistribution of runoff water. Thus, slope and underlying heterogeneity are not essential conditions. Other factors in the model, such as herbivory, plant dispersal, rainfall, and drought tolerance of plants, appear to determine under what conditions pattern formation is likely but are not the primary factors that generate the patterns. The model is in agreement with field observations and indicates the conditions for which vegetation pattern formation can be expected in arid and semi-arid grazing systems.

AB The evolution and maintenance of combined vs. separate sexes in flowering, plants is influenced by both ecological and genetic factors; variation in resources, particularly moisture availability, is thought to play a role in selection for gender dimorphism in some groups. We investigated the density, distribution, biomass allocation, and physiology of sympatric monomorphic (cosexual) and dimorphic (female and male) populations If Wurmbea dioica in relation to soil moisture on the Darling Escarpment in southwestern Australia. Populations with monomorphic vs. dimorphic sexual systems segregated into wet vs. dry microsites, respectively, and biomass allocation patterns and physiological traits reflected differences in water availability, despite similarities in total ramet biomass between the sexual systems. Unisexuals flowered earlier at lower density, and they allocated significantly more biomass below ground to roots and corms than did cosexuals, which allocated more biomass above ground to leaves, stems, and flowers. Females, males, and cosexuals produced similar numbers of flowers per ramet, but unisexuals. produced more ramets than cosexuals, increasing the total number of flowers per genet. Contrary to expectation, cosexuals had significantly higher (more positive) leaf carbon isotope ratios and lower leaf nitrogen content than unisexuals, suggesting that cosexuals are more water-use efficient and have lower rates of photosynthesis per unit leaf mass despite their occurrence in wetter microsites. Cosexuals appear to adjust their stomatal behavior to minimize water loss through transpiration while maintaining high investment in leaves and reproductive structures. Unisexuals apparently maximize the acquisition and storage of both water and nitrogen through increased allocation to roots and corms and enhance the uptake of CO, by keeping stomata more open. These findings indicate that the two sexual systems have different morphological and physiological features associated with local-scale variation in water availability.

AB Modern ecology often emphasizes the distinction between traditional theories of stable, environmentally structured communities and a new paradigm of disturbance-driven, nonequilibrium dynamics. However, multiple hypotheses for observed vegetation patterns have seldom been explicitly tested. We used multivariate statistics and variation partitioning methods to assess the relative influences of environmental factors and disturbance history on riparian and hillslope Forests. Our study area was the Cummins Creek Wilderness, located in the Oregon Coast Range. Most of the wilderness burned at least once between the mid-19th and early 20th centuries, creating a mosaic of younger forests with a few old-growth parches. Species composition on hillslopes varied primarily along a climatic gradient from moist maritime environments to drier inland climates but was relatively insensitive to forest age structure. The abundance of Tsuga heterophylla. a fire-sensitive, late-successional tree species, decreased with distance from old-growth patches, suggesting possible seed-source limitations following the historical fires. In contrast to species composition, hillslope forest structure was primarily related to fire history but was largely independent of environmental gradients. Old-growth structure characteristics such as large dominant trees, large snags, high down-wood volumes. and high tree size diversity increased with stand age and with the presence of remnant trees that survived the fires. Riparian forests had high shrub cover, abundant hardwoods, and high down-wood volumes, while the conifer-dominated hillslopes had high overstory density and basal area. Maritime climates and their associated plant species extended further inland in riparian areas than on hillslopes. Advance regeneration densities were higher in riparian forests within 5 km of the coast than in any other portion of the study area. Riparian forest structure and composition were related to both environmental and disturbance variables, with stream gradient and size integrating much of the fine-scale variability in disturbance regimes. No single theoretical framework was sufficient to explain the vegetation patterns observed in these forested watersheds. Our findings suggest a conceptual model of forest landscapes in which the relative influences of environment and disturbance on vegetation patterns are contingent on the facet of vegetation considered (composition vs, structure) and the portion of the landscape examined (hillslope vs. riparian).

AB The chances of prey to survive and leave Viable offspring may be determined by many environmental constraints, of which food conditions may be of key importance. When food is not limited, the high reproductive effort of a well-fed prey individual displaying various defensive responses may assure successful reproduction, whereas low food supplies may prevent it by limiting energy gains and expenditures on defense and procreation. Under low chances for survival of active forms in a local environment, production of diapausing forms of enhanced resistance to unfavorable conditions or dispersion to more favorable places may assure persistence.
   The laboratory batch-cultured experiments detailed here sought to test whether food concentration may influence probability of producing resting eggs by Daphnia when under chemically simulated fish predation pressure. In "fish-free" conditions, no production of resting eggs was observed with either the tested low (0.4 mg C/L) or high (1.6 mg C/L) food concentrations, whereas in "fish" treatments, resting eggs were produced by various proportions of females according to food concentration. With the limited food (0.4 mg C/L) there was production of ephippial (dormant) eggs in the early broods of almost all females in the "fish" treatment. Where food concentrations were higher, proportions of ephippial females were progressively lower, with females postponing the formation of resting eggs until later broods. At the highest food concentration (1.6 mg Cn), only about 17% of females produced ephippia when exposed to fish cues. These results are considered to indicate an adaptive response of prey individuals to a simulated danger of predation in various food conditions, determining relative gains of producing active vs, dormant offspring. It seems that D. magna may "assess" their chances of survival and successful reproduction in accordance with the anticipated danger of predation and food conditions, and enter diapause when the expected gains from diapause exceed those of active life. A graphical model explaining observed production of active vs, dormant offspring by D. magna under predation pressure at Various food concentration is proposed.

AB Population regulation of Merlins (Falco columbarius) was studied during 16 years in a small area supporting up to 11 breeding pairs, and during seven years in an expanded area where breeding numbers varied between 28 and 38 pairs. During the study period, the previously regular 4-yr cyclicity in rodent abundance disappeared, for unknown reasons. The functional form of density dependence agreed with a version of the Picker equation, which showed that there was direct density dependence in the number of Merlin pairs attempting to breed. Moreover, in seasons with high small-rodent density, local population density of Merlins increased, and breeding territories were established in areas that, in other years, did not sustain breeders. Overwinter loss of males was directly related to breeding population size in the preceding year, as well as to small-rodent density. In contrast, overwinter loss of females appeared to be independent of breeding population size and food abundance in the preceding year.

AB Interactions between plants and soil affect plant-plant interactions and community composition. Festuca arundinacea (tall fescue) is often infected with the mutualistic fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum. Infected (E+) F. arundinacea has been reported to inhibit soil pathogens; nematodes, and mycorrhizal fungi, and to have greater mineral uptake from the soil relative to uninfected (E-) F. arundinacea. In addition, endophyte presence may indirectly influence the soil by altering the plant-plant interactions and the composition of communities. Recent studies have shown that local plant species diversity was reduced in experimental field plots with E+ F. arundinacea compared to plots with E- plants. Endophyte-induced changes, direct or indirect, in biotic or abiotic soil properties could therefore affect subsequent plant growth. We investigated soil-mediated effects of E+ F. arundinacea on ES and E- F. arundinacea. Trifolium repens, and Plantago lanceolata by growing each in soil collected from the aforementioned field plots seeded with either E+ or E- F. arundinacea. Infection status of F. arundinacea plots had no direct effect on any measured characteristic of plants grown in soil from those plots. However, responses of experimental plants suggest that, by inducing changes in plant community composition, E+ F. arundinacea may indirectly affect the soil. Most notable was an increase in E+ F. arundinacea total biomass when grown in soil previously dominated by Pea pratensis and other grass species compared to biomass when grown in soil previously dominated by E+ F. arundinacea, indicative of an indirect negative feedback on E+ F. arundinacea growth. In addition, Plantago and Trifolium root biomass was significantly higher when grown in soil that previously supported a high proportion of P. pratensis relative to other plant species. Such plant-soil dynamics may have important community-level implications in areas dominated by F. arundinacea.

AB Preferences for foraging in particular tree species have been well documented in a variety of bird species, but underlying reasons remain little investigated. Understanding the causal bases for such patterns of habitat use can help to elucidate mechanisms of habitat selection and, therefore, community organization and structure. I experimentally tested the hypothesis that fine-scale foliage structure of two deciduous tree species influences the foraging behavior of three small, insectivorous bird species. On sugar maple (Acer saccharum), with its orbicular leaves elevated above the branch, Black-throated Blue Warblers (Dendroica caerulescens) and American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) captured prey predominantly from lower leaf surfaces, whereas Black-throated Green Warblers (Dendroica virens) captured prey predominantly from upper leaf surfaces. In contrast, on yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), with its oblong-ovate leaves held within the plane of the supporting branch, all three bird species captured prey disproportionately from upper leaf surfaces. Overall, aerial maneuvers were used more frequently to capture prey from upper than from lower leaf surfaces on sugar maple, but the opposite occurred on yellow birch, where non-aerial maneuvers were used more frequently to capture prey from upper than from lower leaf surfaces. Those results indicate that the leaf surface from which prey are more easily captured (with less energetically costly non-aerial maneuvers) differs between those tree species. Experimental manipulation of leaf dispersion and distance to prey demonstrated that leaf dispersion is the chief determinant of prey capture location (upper vs. lower leaf surfaces), and that distance to prey is the chief determinant of prey capture maneuver (aerial vs. non-aerial). When foraging on artificial branches in which vertical distance between branches was systematically increased experimentally, Black-throated Green Warblers captured a significantly smaller proportion of prey from lower surfaces of leaves on the upper branch than did Black-throated Blue Warblers. Taken together, these results indicate that different tree species, as well as different locations within tree species, present insectivorous birds with distinct foraging environments and, therefore, constitute distinct foraging microhabitats. Furthermore, even closely related bird species that are generally similar morphologically respond in behaviorally unique ways to differences in foliage structure. For those reasons, forest management practices that enhance tree species diversity could concomitantly enhance foraging opportunities (niche diversity) for forest insectivores and may thus help to promote high bird species diversity and maintain abundant populations.

AB Little is known of the separate effects of habitat fragmentation and degradation, which are typically confounded by habitat loss. We examined the separate effects of habitat availability, fragmentation, and degradation on the species richness and abundances of commensal species occupying coral colonies on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Species richness, total abundance, and the abundances of the two most common commensals, a crab (Trapezia cymodoce) and a shrimp (Palaemonella sp.), increased with coral colony volume. However, relationships between coral colony volume and abundances of these two species differed. The minimum size of coral colonies inhabited by the shrimps was considerably smaller than that inhabited by the crabs. Furthermore, while abundances of these shrimps increased with colony volume, the crabs tended to occupy their hosts as male: female pairs. We manipulated two aspects of the habitat provided by these corals to their commensals. We fragmented habitats while controlling for habitat loss, and we degraded habitats by killing corals without affecting the physical structure of the habitat. Habitat degradation caused rapid declines in species richness, total abundance, and the abundances of the crab and shrimp species. While these declines were rapid they were not instantanceous, suggesting that some secondary degradation of these habitats caused these declines. Habitat fragmentation, on the other hand, had no effect on species richness, total abundance, or the abundance of the shrimp species. In contrast, abundances of trapezid crabs increased in response to fragmentation, most likely as a result of the liberation of space from territory holders that was then colonized by additional individuals. The patch sizes used in this study were considerably smaller than those used in many terrestrial fragmentation studies. Also, marine populations tend to be more open than terrestrial ones and composed of species with greater dispersal capabilities. Therefore, the application of these results to practical conservation problems will require extreme caution. Nevertheless, disentangling the effects of habitat fragmentation and degradation from habitat loss made effects of fragmentation per se visible. Because these results are novel, such effects of habitat fragmentation could be more widespread than is currently appreciated, and relevant to the development of new management tools for biological conservation.

The results suggest that observation error can lead to a high rate of spurious detection of delayed density dependence.

AB Incidental predation occurs when secondary prey items are encountered and subsequently consumed, not through directed search for such prey, but through their consequential encounter by a predator engaged in search for primary prey. We developed a mathematical model that examines the relationships between the abundance of primary prey, patch exploitation (i.e., quitting harvest rates), and the rate of incidental predation on secondary prey items. The model's predictions are dependent upon the spatial scale over which a forager integrates foraging costs and thus determines its quitting harvest rate (QHR). At local (i.e., foraging) spatial scales, we predicted that incidental predation should increase with local food abundance. Also at the foraging scale, local food abundance should not influence QHRs, but local predation risk (from higher trophic levels) should increase QHRs. Therefore, we predicted that incidental predation rates should be negatively correlated with QHRs. Over large (i.e., landscape) spatial scales, greater food abundance and predation risk increase QHRs, and we predicted that predation rates should vary inversely with QHR through two complementary mechanisms: foragers use a greater proportion of space and spend more time foraging as quitting harvest rates decrease.
   We experimentally tested the qualitative predictions of the theory in the field using artificial Veery (Catharus fuscescens) nests depredated by white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, across three spatial scales. We used the technique of giving-up densities to measure QHRs and to determine the scale at which mice integrate different foraging costs. In accord with our predictions, nest predation was positively influenced by the local abundance of food at the foraging scale, and local predation risk to mice and perhaps interference competition from chipmunks resulted in higher giving-up densities and lower nest predation. At the landscape scale, there was an inverse relationship between giving-up densities and nest predation, which was probably the result of large-scale differences in resource abundance between plots. Our study demonstrates how linking theoretical development to the use of empirical behavioral indicators can help determine the relevant ecological scales and processes necessary for understanding predator-prey interactions.

AB The bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) is a widespread invasive species that may displace several species of native ranid frogs throughout its introduced range. Although this pattern is well known. the underlying mechanism of displacement remains unclear. Previous work has suggested that interactions with bullfrogs may contribute to the population decline of native red-legged frogs (Rana aurora) in Oregon, USA. Interactions between these species appear to be strongly context dependent and potentially influenced by habitat modification. To gain a more detailed understanding of this displacement, we studied the effects of food-resource distribution, a factor that can be influenced by human habitat alteration, on competitive interactions between larval red-legged frogs and larval bullfrogs.
   The presence of bullfrog larvae had strong negative effects on the performance of red-legged frog larvae. However, this effect was dependent on whether food resources were clumped or scattered. Survivorship to metamorphosis and mass at metamorphosis were reduced when red-legged frog tadpoles were exposed to bullfrogs in clumped-resource ponds. In contrast, the presence of bullfrogs had a negligible effect on larval performance of red-legged frogs in scattered-resource ponds.
   Behavioral observations indicate that a passive interference mechanism is likely to be responsible for the outcome of interactions between bullfrogs and red-legged frogs. Our results suggest that clumped resources can intensify interspecific competition, and this may influence the success of exotics when human-induced habitat alteration affects resource distribution, Understanding the context-dependent nature of interactions will be necessary if we are to predict invasion success and control the impact of exotics on natives.

AB The three Negev Desert gerbils, Gerbillus pyramidum (greater Egyptian sand gerbil), Gerbillus allenbyi (Allenby's gerbil), and Gerbillus dasyurus (Wagner's gerbil), show strong patterns of habitat selection along a gradient, from sandy to loessal to rocky habitats, respectively. Within a habitat, a gerbil must be able to harvest seeds and escape predators. To test fur the habitat-specific processes governing habitat partitioning by gerbil species, we investigated the roles of escape substrate and foraging substrate in affecting patch use. In an aviary, we manipulated predatory risk using artificial illumination and the presence of Barn Owls (Tyto alba). We manipulated escape substrate and foraging substrate by creating habitat and food patches of sand, rock (a mix of sand and small rocks), and loess substrate. In response to owls, all three gerbil species foraged less and increased their giving-up densities (GUDs) in food patches. In response to foraging substrate, all three species had their lowest GUDs on sand, and their highest GUDs on loess. Gerbillus dasyurus responded less intensively to owls when loess comprised the foraging substrate. Also, each species depended more on its "home" foraging substrate than did the others for the total amount of seeds harvested. Gerbillus pyramidum in particular harvested a greater proportion from sand than did G. dasyurus. Escape substrate had no direct effects on patch use. However, G. dasyurus exhibited a foraging substrate x escape substrate interaction, as the rocky escape substrate enhanced its use of the rocky foraging substrate. Our experiments show that foraging substrate contributes to habitat use by G. allenbyi and G. pyramidum, and that both foraging substrate and escape substrate contribute to habitat use by G. dasyurus.

AB We tested whether the spatial variation in resource depletion by Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus) foraging on belowground tubers of sage pondweed (Potnmogeton pectinatus) was caused by differences in net energy intake rates. The variation in giving up densities within the confines of one lake was nearly eightfold, the giving-up density being positively related to water depth and, to a lesser extent, the silt content of the sediment. The swans' preference (measured as cumulative foraging pressure) was negatively related to these variables. We adjusted a model developed for diving birds to predict changes in the time allocation of foraging swans with changes in power requirements and harvest rate. First, we compared the behavior of free-living swans foraging in shallow and deep water where they feed by head-dipping and up-ending, respectively. Up-ending swans had 1.3-2.1 times longer feeding times than,head-dipping swans. This was contrary to our expectation, since the model predicted a decrease in feeding time with an increase in feeding power. However up-ending swans also had 1.9 times longer trampling times than head-dipping swans. The model predicted a strong positive correlation between trampling time and feeding time, and the longer trampling times may thus have masked any effect of an increase in feeding power. Heart rate measurements showed that trampling was the most energetically costly part of foraging. However, because the feeding time and trampling time changed concurrently, the rate of energy expenditure was only slightly higher in deep water (1.03-1.06 times). This is a conservative estimate since it does not take into account that the feeding costs of up-ending are possibly higher than that of head-dipping. Second, we compared captive swans foraging on sandy and clayey sediments. We found that the harvest rate on clayey sediment was only 0.6 times that on sandy sediment and that the power requirements for foraging were 1.2-1.4 times greater. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the hypothesis that the large spatial variation in giving-up densities was caused by differences in net rates of energy intake. This potentially has important implications for the prey dynamics, because plant regrowth has been shown to be related to the same habitat factors (water depth and sediment type.)

AB Mixed tree-grass vegetation is important globally at ecotones between grasslands and forests. To address uncertainties vis-g-vis productivity and nitrogen (N) cycling in such systems we studied 20 mature oak savanna stands, ranging from 90% woody dominated to 80% herbaceous dominated, growing on comparable soils in a 32-yr-old fire frequency experiment in Minnesota, USA. Fire frequencies rang ed from almost annual burning to complete fire protection. Across all stands, aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) ranged from 2 to 12 Mg(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1), decreased with fire frequency (r(2) = 0.59), increased with woody canopy dominance (r(2) = 0.83), and increased with soil net N mineralization rates (r(2) = 0.79), which varied from 25 to 150 kg(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1). ANPP was positively related to total biomass (r(2) = 0.95), total canopy leaf N content (r(2) = 0.88), leaf area index (LAI; r(2) = 0.87), annual litterfall N cycling (r(2) = 0.70), foliage N concentration (r(2) = 0.62), and fine root N concentration (r(2) = 0.35), all of which also increased with increasing tree canopy cover. ANPP, soil N mineralization, and estimated root turnover rates increased with woody canopy cover even for stands with similar fire frequency. ANPP and N mineralization both decreased with fire frequency for stands having a comparable percentage of woody canopy cover. Fine root standing biomass increased with increasing grass dominance. However, fine root turnover rate estimated with a nitrogen budget technique decreased proportionally more with increasing grass dominance, and hence fine root productivity decreased along the same gradient.
   Via several direct and indirect and mutually reinforcing (feedback) effects, the combination of low fire frequency and high tree dominance leads to high rates of N cycling, LAI, and productivity; while the opposite, high fire frequency and high grass dominance, leads to low rates of N cycling, LAI, and productivity. Carbon and N cycling were tightly coupled across the fire frequency and vegetation type gradients.

AB Interspecific differences in tree performance due to variation in resource availability are expected to influence the structure and dynamics of tropical forest communities. Patterns of mortality and growth over 32 mo in 11 species of Macaranga were analyzed to investigate factors influencing tree spatial distributions and the dynamics of early successional communities. Tree performance was assessed in relation to variation in light levels, soil texture, and tree ontogeny. Rates of mortality and growth varied by over an order of magnitude among species. Species common in high-light microsites had higher mortality and growth rates. Higher low-light mortality for these species reflected lower shade tolerances, supporting the view that shade tolerance involves a trade-off between high-light growth and low-light mortality.
   Logistic and multiple regressions were used to test for independent effects of tree size and microenvironment on performance in the 11 species. Mortality and growth were significantly related to tree size in nine and eight species, respectively. Higher mortality and lower growth rates for juvenile trees were common. Despite positive correlations between light availability and tree size, mortality rates increased in three species, and growth rates decreased in four species at larger tree sizes. This pattern was particularly strong in smaller statured shade-intolerant species and may reflect changes in biomass allocation following reproductive onset. Declines in growth at larger tree sizes for only some species resulted in changes in species' performance rankings through succession.
   Low-light mortality rates were strongly correlated with species' distributions in the forest with respect to light levels, whereas biases in distributions with respect to soil texture were not supported by differential mortality. For all trees pooled and in several species, growth showed a threshold response to light levels, being light-limited in low light but not in high light. Across all light levels, soil texture significantly influenced growth in six species. Five species and all trees pooled had significantly lower growth on the more nutrient-poor and potentially drought-prone sandy soils. The dynamics of Macaranga-dominated early successional communities are strongly influenced by soil resource and light availability, coupled with species-specific ontogenetic trajectories of performance.

AB We used a modeling approach to determine the conditions under which fragmentation of breeding habitat can cause landscape-scale population declines in songbirds. The simulated species resided in a system of forest patches (a landscape) and could potentially disperse among patches between breeding seasons. The model combined: (I) the frequency distribution of patch sizes in the landscape, (2) the distribution of individuals across the range of patches in the landscape, and (3) the fecundity of individuals as a function of patch size in the landscape. Simulated landscapes varied in patch size distribution while holding total forest area constant. Three distribution patterns were modeled: the classic "area-sensitive" pattern in which density increased as patch size increased, an area-insensitive pattern in which density was independent of patch size, and an "inverse-area-sensitive" pattern in which density increased as patch size decreased. We used this model to examine population growth under various landscape, distribution, fecundity, and survival scenarios.
   In the "fragmentation hypothesis" simulations, in which fecundity decreased as patch size decreased within the landscape, population growth rates were highly sensitive to distribution patterns and to landscape composition. When landscapes consisted of both large and small patches for breeding, populations were either above or below replacement, depending on how individuals were distributed among patches: Classic area-sensitive distributions produced growth rates above replacement levels, whereas inverse-area-sensitive distributions produced growth rates below replacement levels. The results of the model suggest that reduced fecundity associated with habitat fragmentation could lead to population declines when (1) landscapes are highly fragmented, or (2) landscapes offer both large and small patches for breeding, but distribution patterns place a high proportion of the breeding population on small patches that are less favorable for breeding.

AB In a landscape context, nesting avian predators cause variation in predation risk with respect to the distance to their nests, which may have both direct (predation) and indirect (predation risk) effects on the prey community. We studied the community assembly and spatial distribution of a breeding forest bird community in a structurally complex forest landscape surrounding forest-hunting Sparrowhawk (Accipirer nisus) nests. Birds were censused on transect arrays within 1-ha study plots divided into four subplots. We determined whether the distribution of species within study plots was clumped, random, or uniform. Because predation risk is higher nearer a hawk's nest than farther away, we predicted that species would show a more clumped distribution within study plots near the Sparrowhawks' nests than farther away. We also expected densities and community patterns to vary with respect to predation risk. The results suggest that predation and/or its risk has a complex and local effect on the prey community. The predation risk negatively affected the number of species and densities of birds only in the first year (1996) of study. The relationship between the density of large birds (greater than or equal to 20 g, preferred prey) and predation risk was also negative in 1996, but not in 1997, whereas the density of small birds (<20 g) was not affected by predation risk in either year. There was no relationship between predation risk and clumping for all species together. When we analyzed separately plots that contained large and small birds or large birds alone, however, increasing predation risk positively affected the index of dispersion, but only in thicket (one of the forest types), which is probably the preferred hunting habitat for Sparrowhawk. These results are well in line with studies made on predator-prey interactions in farmlands. In those studies, however, the effects of predators on prey communities were much stronger and extended farther in the landscape from the nest of predators than in this forest study. A possible reason for this difference is higher habitat structural complexity in forests, which may mitigate the effect of predators.

AB Energy balance is relevant to diverse issues in ecology, physiology, and evolution. To determine whether lizards are generally in positive energy balance, we synthesized a massive data set on the proportion of individual lizards (N = 18 223) with empty stomachs (127 species), representing nine families distributed on four continents, primarily in temperate zone deserts but also in the neotropics. The average percentage of individuals with empty stomachs is low (13.2%) across all species, even among desert lizards, suggesting that most lizards are in positive energy balance. Nevertheless, species vary substantially in this regard (among all species, 0% to 66% of individuals have empty stomachs). Several patterns are detectable among species with unusually high frequencies of empty stomachs. In particular, nocturnal lizards "run on empty" more often on average than do diurnal species (24.1% vs. 10.5%); and this pattern holds even for nocturnal vs. diurnal geckos (21.2% vs. 7.2%, respectively). Several (but not all) top predators have a higher frequency of empty stomachs than do species that feed at lower trophic levels. Diet breadth and body size appear unrelated to frequency of empty stomachs. Widely foraging species sometimes have a high frequency of empty stomachs relative to sit-and-wait species, but patterns vary among continents and appear to be confounded by phylogeny and trophic level. Ant-eating specialists have uniformly low frequencies of empty stomachs. Diurnal termite specialists also have low frequencies of empty stomachs, but nocturnal ones have high frequencies. Lizards from certain families (Gekkonidae [including Pygopodidae],Gymnophthlamidae, and Varanidae) are more likely to have empty stomachs than an those of other families (Agamidae, Iguanidae, Lacertidae, Scincidae, and Teiidae).

AB We investigated the long-term effects of shifting cultivation on soil phosphorus pools to understand the effects of repeated intense disturbance on nutrient cycling in rain forests and to assess the sustainability of a widespread tropical agricultural system. We studied 24 sites that formed a gradient of cultivation history near a village in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, where long-fallow shifting cultivation has been practiced for at least 200 yr. The sites, including primary forest, had undergone 0-10 prior cycles (each similar to 20 yr) of cultivation and forest regrowth. The number of swidden-fallow cycles experienced at a given site was determined through interviews. Using sequential chemical extraction of surface soils, we inferred changes in the distribution and availability of soil phosphorus during 200 yr of shifting cultivation. We examined the relative importance of fire vs. secondary forest biota in mediating the changes observed by heating soils in the laboratory to simulate the conditions of a slash fire and assessing data on root presence by depth.
   Over the first four cycles (similar to 80 yr), total phosphorus in the top 30 cm of soil increased by a mean of 73 kg(.)ha(-1)-cycle(-1) (3.7 kg(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1)), much of it in the organic NaOH-extractable and the inorganic, concentrated HCl-extractable, fractions. Accounting for differences in original site fertility, total P did not change significantly over 2-10 cycles (similar to 200 yr), but the distribution shifted from both available and highly recalcitrant inorganic forms to available organic and occluded inorganic forms. NaOH-P-i decreased from 28% to 13%, and residual P decreased from 30% to 10% of total P. In contrast, NaOH-P-o increased from 13% to 26%, and cHCI-P-i increased from 15% to 40%.
   The significant increase in soil organic phosphorus in combination with greater concentrations of fine roots deep in the soil profile suggest that deep-rooting fallow vegetation, rather than fire, is responsible for increasing, and maintaining, total phosphorus. The magnitude of changes induced by the fire are not great enough to account for the increases observed over several cycles, especially considering coincidental losses. Despite losses of nonoccluded P-i, we believe the availability of phosphorus may have been enhanced over 200 yr due to an increase in the stable organic phosphorus fraction. Long-fallow shifting cultivation, as practiced in West Kalimantan, can continue to support rural populations for some time.

AB Earlier studies of habitat-specific subpopulations of mixed clonal and sexual freshwater snails of the species Potamopyrgus antipodarum have revealed clinal variation by depth in several life-history traits, risk of parasite infection, mixed population structure, and the genetic structure of the clonal population. Clinal variation is pronounced in life-history traits: snails are larger and start reproduction later in the deeper habitats. The proportion of clonal individuals increases with depth, and many clones are habitat-specific. While these patterns are well documented, it is not known which processes have led to the observed genetic divergence in the clonal population. In this study, we experimentally investigated the contribution of phenotypic plasticity to habitat-specific life-history trait variation using reciprocal transplant experiments with adult and juvenile snails. Assessment of phenotypic plasticity is important because canalized habitat-specific life-history trait variation is one of the alternative explanations for habitat-specific genetic divergence seen in the clonal population. However, if life-history trait variation is largely due to adaptive phenotypic plasticity, canalized optimization of life-history traits is unlikely to explain the divergence observed in the clonal structure. We found significant habitat-induced variation fur growth rate, proportion of brooding females, brood size, number of surviving offspring, and juvenile survival, indicating that much of the life-history variation must be considered the result of phenotypic plasticity. Based on these results, it seems that life-history trait divergence is unlikely to explain habitat-specific clonal structure. In contrast, we found genetically based differences in resistance to parasite infections, snails of the deeper Isoetes habitat were more susceptible to infection than snails of the shallow shorebank habitat. To our surprise, we found only a few habitat-by-origin interactions that could directly contribute to the maintenance of the observed habitat-specific clonal structure. One potentially important interaction, however, was that in the deeper Isoetes habitat, reproductive output of snails transplanted from the shallow habitat was lower than that of resident snails. In addition, we also found that survival of clonal snails may be poorer in unfamiliar habitat's than that of sexual P. antipodarum, potentially promoting the maintenance of habitat-specific clonal assemblages. Thus, higher parasite resistance of shallow-water snails in both habitats and lower reproductive output of shallow-water snails in the deep habitat are likely to contribute to the maintenance of the habitat-specific clonal structure in P. antipodarum populations, whereas most of the observed variation in life-history traits seems to be due to phenotypic plasticity, which is likely to be adaptive.

AB The effects of prey heterogeneity and consumer identity on the strength of predator limitation of prey biomass were explored experimentally under controlled laboratory conditions. In this study, I utilized a model aquatic community composed of zooplankton as top predators, algae as prey, and nutrients as basal resources. To examine the effects of prey heterogeneity, I created a food chain initially composed of a single edible prey and a food web initially composed of a diverse assemblage of algae. These two prey treatments were then fully crossed with two predator treatments (a large-bodied zooplankter, Daphnia pulex, and a small-bodied species, Ceriodaphnia quadrangula), and two levels of productivity. Prey heterogeneity had clear effects on the ability of predators to limit overall prey biomass. In food chains, predators had strong negative effects on algae, and algal biomass exhibited a narrow response to enrichment. In contrast, predator limitation was weak in food webs with the consequence that predator and prey biomass both showed positive increases with productivity. The prey community in food webs also exhibited a striking increase in the relative abundance of lar-e inedible algae with enrichment, in keeping with model predictions. These results indicate that prey heterogeneity can have substantial effects on predator-prey dynamics and trophic structure and can serve to shift systems from strong top-down control to ones in which prey are colimited by predators and resources. Comparisons between top predators showed that Daphnia, compared to Ceriodaphnia, more strongly limited the biomass of large algae in food webs at high productivity and total algal biomass in all nutrient-enriched treatments (both chains and webs). Thus, consumer identity and ecological context (productivity and heterogeneity of prey communities) may mediate the strength of zooplankton-algae. interactions and the efficacy of trophic cascades.

AB We investigated the effects of interspecific competition on abundance, habitat partitioning, and coexistence of six closely related species of gobies (genus Gobiodon) that inhabit a range of coral species at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. After documenting the extent of overlap in habitat use among pairs of species in the field, we used a combination of field and laboratory experiments to investigate the relationship between these patterns and the occurrence of interspecific competition. Experiments in aquaria tested the ability of five of the species to compete against Gobiodon histrio, the apparent competitive dominant, including the effects of body size and prior residency. A manipulative field experiment, in which abundance of G. histrio was reduced, tested whether competition with this species limits the abundance of the other five species.
   Two species competed for space with G. histrio in the field, yet overlap in habitat use with G. histrio was high for one of these species (G. axillaris) and low for the other (G. brochus). In aquaria, G. axillaris and G. histrio preferred the same species of coral and had equivalent, size-based, competitive abilities. The coexistence of G. axillaris and G. histrio at the scale of tens of meters on the reef can thus be explained by a competitive lottery model. However, differential distributions of these two species across the reef flat and reef crest suggest that resource partitioning or habitat selection at larger spatial scales may also be important to their coexistence. In aquaria, G. brochus was an inferior competitor to G. histrio and could only gain access to the preferred species of coral through an advantage in body size or prior residency. Low overlap in habitat use between G. brochus and G. histrio in the field appears to result from niche shifts by the subordinate competitor only.
   The field experiment indicated that the other three species did not compete for space with G. histrio. Experiments in aquaria demonstrated that G. rivulatus and G. histrio exhibited low overlap in habitat use and did not compete, because they preferred different species of coral. In contrast. G. unicolor and G. histrio exhibited high overlap in habitat use but did not compete, because they were able to cohabit the same coral colonies without affecting each other. In aquaria, G. quinquestrigatus and G. histrio preferred the same coral species' however, in a field recolonization experiment, coral colonies previously occupied by G. quinquestrigatus were rarely recolonized by G. histrio, indicating that these species coexist because they use different types of coral colonies in the field. The study demonstrates that there is no single relationship between overlap in resource use and the occurrence of interspecific competition and that species within a guild can coexist by a diversity of mechanisms.

AB We examined whether intraguild predation (IGP) weakens the ability of two taxa of generalist predators, carabid beetles and lycosid spiders, to control herbivore densities in gardens of cucumber and squash. We also measured fruit production to determine whether IGP weakens the ability of the predators to impact plants indirectly through trophic cascades. These predators did impact herbivore densities, but their impact on different herbivores varied dramatically. As the herbivore community changed through the season, so too did the predators' indirect effect on fruit production.
   In spring cucumber gardens, lycosids caused fruit production to increase by reducing densities of striped cucumber beetles, which are important early-season herbivores. Carabids also weakly reduced cucumber beetle densities, and the entire carabid-lycosid guild enhanced cucumber yield. However, the carabid-lycosid guild's impact changed dramatically later in the season. In summer squash gardens, carabids increased fruit production by reducing densities of the squash bug, the major late-season herbivore. In marked contrast, lycosid spiders strongly reduced squash yield, possibly by IGP on important hemipteran predators of the squash bug. The late-season effects of carabids and lycosids counteracted one another, so that the complete carabid beetle-lycosid spider guild had no impact on squash fruit production. Thus, the complex trophic connections between generalist predators and the rest of the community made the predators' impact relatively fluid, changing even within a single season. Results of pairing predators with herbivores or other predators in laboratory microcosms supported hypothesized trophic interactions in both spring and summer food webs.

AB Ecological theory has long supported the idea that species coexistence in a homogeneous habitat is promoted by spatial structure, but empirical evidence for this hypothesis has lagged behind theory. Here we describe a Neotropical ant-plant symbiosis that is ideally suited for testing spatial models of coexistence. Two genera of ants, Allomerus cf. demerarae and three species of Azteca are specialized to live on a single species of ant-plant, Cordia nodosa, in a Western Amazonian tropical rain forest. Empirically, using census data from widely separated localities, we show that the relative colonization abilities of the two ant genera are a function of plant density. A parameterized model shows that this pattern alone is sufficiently robust to explain coexistence in;the system. Census and experimental data suggest that Azteca queens are better long-distance flyers, but that Allomerus colonies are more fecund. Thus, Azteca can dominate in areas where host-plant densities are low land parent colony-sapling distances are long), and Allomerus can dominate in areas where host-plant densities are high. Existing spatial heterogeneity in host-plant densities therefore can allow regional coexistence, and intersite dispersal can produce local mixing. In conclusion, a dispersal-fecundity trade-off appears to allow the two genera to treat spatial heterogeneity in patch density as a niche axis. This study further suggests that a spatially structured approach is essential in understanding the persistence of some mutualisms in the presence of parasites.

AB A link between stream geomorphology and lotic ecosystems was demonstrated by quantitatively examining the precise locations of salmonid redds with respect to the planform geometry of streams using a differential global positioning system. A total stream distance of 59 km was surveyed in 17 streams, in which a total of 309 redds of Sakhalin taimen (Hucho perryi) were recorded. The average size (+/- SD) of these redds was 227 +/- 60 cm in length and 122 +/- 42 cm in width. A meta-analysis of these data showed that channel sinuosity was significantly greater at sites where Sakhalin taimen redds were constructed than,the average stream sinuosity. This salmonid preference for highly sinuous reaches was detected when the sinuosity index was calculated at 50-m increments and became insignificant at greater distance increments. This habitat-sinuosity relationship will be more pronounced in streams with only moderately sinuous channels, less abundant large woody debris, and higher spawner densities.

AB Among plants, differences in competition intensity and in the ranking of competitive ability for traits such as germination, growth, and survival may suggest that the importance of competition for population success varies with the trait measured. If a species is a good competitor when measured by one component of fitness (e.g., seedling growth), but a poor competitor when measured by a different component of fitness (e.g., seedling survival), understanding the relative importance of each component of fitness for persistence in the community is critical to understanding how communities are structured. Using a held and a garden experiment in southeastern Michigan, we generated competitive response hierarchies among 4-8 old-field perennials for five components of fitness (germination, seedling growth, seedling survival, adult growth, and adult survival). We examined how the overall response to neighbors changes among components of fitness, the concordance of hierarchies within and among components of fitness, and the correlations between competitive hierarchies and natural abundance. We found little to no overall effect of neighbors on germination and seedling survival, indicating a high tolerance (= strong response competitive ability) of species for neighbors as measured by these components of fitness. We found a strong effect of neighbors on seedling growth, and on adult survival and growth, indicating poorer response competitive ability overall for these components. Although rankings of competitive ability were concordant among species across all components of fitness, certain demographic parameters were more consistent in their rankings than others. Specifically, competitive response hierarchies based on size were strongly concordant, while those based on survival were not. This suggests that future studies may effectively estimate response competitive ability for growth with a single estimate, but that estimates of response competitive ability for survival at both the seedling and adult stages may be required. Finally, competitive response rankings based on germination and seedling growth were most strongly correlated with abundance, suggesting that these components of fitness more strongly influence success in the community than do seedling survival and adult growth and survival.

AB Thermal constraint on energy assimilation is an important source of life history variation in geographically widespread ectotherms such as the eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus). Fence lizards in southern populations grow faster and produce more offspring per year than do those in northern populations. Biophysical models indicate that this difference in production is the result of thermal constraints on energy assimilation, but they do not exclude intraspecific variation in behavior or physiology. I quantified both thermoregulatory behavior and the thermal sensitivity of metabolizable energy intake (MEI) in lizards from New Jersey (NJ) and South Carolina (SC) populations of Sceloporus undulatus. In the laboratory, I conducted feeding trials to estimate MEI at body temperatures experienced by field-active lizards (20 degrees, 30 degrees, 33 degrees. and 36 degreesC). I also measured preferred body temperature (T-p) of lizards in a thermal gradient. In the field, I estimated the accuracy of thermoregulation by lizards. Both NJ and SC lizards exhibited a maximal MEI at their T-p (33 degreesC), but lizards from SC had a significantly higher MEI at this temperature than lizards from NJ. Although lizards in both populations thermoregulated within 2 degreesC of T-p, lizards in SC could maintain T-p for a longer duration on a daily and annual basis. Therefore. lizards in SC could assimilate more energy because they had a higher maximal MEI during activity and were active for longer durations than lizards in NJ. Geographic variation in the life history of S. undulatus may be caused by differentiation of physiology between populations, as well as by differences in the thermal environments of populations.

AB Primary producers and decomposers-the two most important groups for the functioning of ecosystems-have complex, indirect interactions. They are indirect mutualists through nutrient cycling, but also competitors for inorganic nutrients due to Stoichiometric constraints in decomposers. We examine the conditions under which they are able to coexist, and hence ecosystems are able to persist, using a stoichiometrically explicit minimum model for an ecosystem. The model takes into account the coupling of carbon and a nutrient in the biomass and detritus, the nutrient limitation and the energy-providing role of primary producers, the recycling role of decomposers, and the stoichiometric constraints leading to indirect competition for the nutrient, The model shows that two conditions must be met to ensure coexistence of primary producers and decomposers: (1) decomposers must be limited by the carbon provided by plant detritus,. and (2) the difference between the carbon: nutrient ratios of primary producers and decomposers must be sufficiently small. Condition (1) is fulfilled if decomposers are better competitors than primary producers for nutrient uptake. When nutrient uptake by plants and decomposers has a Lotka-Volterra form, these results are robust whether the nutrient cycle is closed or open. When nutrient uptake is donor controlled, however, coexistence is facilitated by an open nutrient cycle. We conclude that ecosystem persistence is not a trivial issue when stoichiometry is taken into account in ecological processes. Strict conditions on the carbon: nutrient ratios and competitive abilities of plants and microorganisms may be required. Given these theoretical results, we highlight the lack of experimental data concerning primary producer and decomposer coexistence conditions. and we suggest that more research has to be performed.

AB There have been few descriptions of tree crown asymmetry and its development. Here I present the most comprehensive geometric description to date of crown asymmetry within a forest canopy and use allometric, trigonometric, and growth analyses to tentatively identify the dominant cause.
   A 25.6 x 25.6 in quadrat within a pure stand of Atherosperma moschatum Labillardiere (Monimiaceae) in Tasmania was mapped with respect to the locations of tree trunks and crowns. Trunk girths and tree heights were also measured. Trunk girths were again measured ten years later. Standing biomass, growth rates, and structural properties of the trees were estimated from models.
   Crowns were more evenly spaced than trunks and showed a significant alignment by angle, both characteristics consistent with a tendency toward the optimal packing of the canopy. The displacement of crown locations from trunk locations was correlated both with the nearness of neighbors and with the cast-facing aspect. For the quadrat as a whole, there was a projected tilt to the trees of 0.73 m 76.3 degrees east of north. The displacement of crown locations from trunk locations was largely achieved early in tree development, consistent with a phototropic response to acute photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) limitation to growth in the understory, evident in the lower relative (projected canopy-area-specific) growth rates of the smaller trees, and with the propensity of A. moschatum to reproduce by vegetative sprouting.
   There was little evidence of size-dependent variation in the mechanical stresses within the trunks, but more detailed analysis of wood structure is needed. The overall height safety factor (a measure of buckling resistance) for the trees in the quadrat was 4.2, the highest reported factor to date for any tree species. Tasmania is an island in the "roaring forties," and the high value of the safety factor is a likely response to strong and persistent winds.
   The estimates of the maximum growth rates of individual trees were 14.9 and 8.7 kg/yr for each of two models. The estimates of the growth rate for the whole stand were 12.1 and 7 m(3.)ha(-1.)yr(-1) (8.5 and 4.9 metric tons per hectare per year, respectively).

AB New Zealand's four broad-leaved evergreen tree species from the genus Nothofagus all show pronounced distributional disjunctions, independent of environmental factors known to influence tree distributions. Here, we use these disjunctions as the basis for a natural removal experiment to investigate competitive interactions between Nothofagus and a range of other widespread conifer and broad-leaved tree species. We first model the abundance of non-Nothofagus species as a function of environment, using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and an extensive data set sampling much of New Zealand's remaining old-growth forests. We then assess the effects of competitive interaction with Nothofagus by adding statistical terms describing (1) Nothofagus abundance, and (2) interactions between Nothofagus abundance and annual temperature, the dominant environmental gradient. Results indicate substantial reductions in the abundance of many species as Nothofagus abundance increases. The magnitude of this reduction varies with position along the dominant environmental gradient; species overlapping most strongly with Nothofagus are generally most sensitive to increases in Nothofagus abundance. In addition, both the shapes of species responses to mean annual temperature and the positions of their optima change as Nothofagus abundance increases. This demonstration of competition using community compositional data has implications both for vegetation theory and for prediction of the likely impacts of global warming on New Zealand's forest pattern.

AB Amazonian forests are the largest and most diverse in the tropics. and much of the mystery surrounding their ecology can be traced to attempts to understand them through tiny local inventories. In this paper we bring together a large number of such inventories scattered across immense areas of western Amazonia in order to address simple questions about the distribution and abundance of tropical tree species in lowland terra firme forests there. The goal is to describe patterns of commonness and rarity at local (1 ha), landscape (similar to 10(4) km(2)), and regional (> 10(6) km(2)) scales, and to fuse the results into a more complete picture of how tropical tree communities are structured. We present estimates of landscape-scale densities for similar to 1400 taxa. based on data from tree plots scattered over large tracts of terra firme forest in eastern Ecuador and southeastern Peru. A database of morphological. ecological, and other traits of > 1000 of these species compiled from the taxonomic literature is then used to explore how species that are common in the inventories differ from species that are rare.
   Although most species show landscape-scale densities of < 1 individual/ha, most trees in both forests belong to a small set of ubiquitous common species. These common species combine high frequency with high local abundance, forming predictable oligarchies that dominate several thousand square kilometers of forest at each site.
   The common species comprising these oligarchies are a nonrandom subset of the two floras. At both sites a disproportionate number of common species are concentrated in the families Arecaceae, Moraceae, Myristicaceae, and Violaceae, and large-statured tree species are more likely to be common than small ones. Nearly a third of the 150 most common tree species in the Ecuadorean forest are also found among the 150 most common tree species in the Peruvian forest. For the 254 tree species shared by the two data sets, abundance in Ecuador is positively and significantly correlated with abundance similar to 1400 km away in Peru.
   These findings challenge popular depictions of Amazonian vegetation as a small-scale mosaic of unpredictable composition and structure. Instead, they provide additional evidence that tropical tree communities are not qualitatively different from their temperate counterparts., where a few common species concentrated in a few higher taxa can dominate immense areas of forest. We hypothesize that most Amazonian forests are dominated at large scales by oligarchies similar in nature to the ones observed in Ecuador and Peru, and we argue that the patterns are more indicative of regulation of relative abundances by ecological factors than of nonequilibrium chance-based dynamics. The paper concludes with a discussion of the practical applications of predictable oligarchies over large areas of unexplored forest.

AB Habitat fragmentation is increasingly common on land and in the sea, leading to small, isolated habitat patches in which ecological processes may differ substantially from those in larger, continuous habitats. Seagrass is a productive but fragmented subtidal habitat that serves as a refuge from predation for many animals because its structural complexity limits the detection and capture of resident prey. The singular influence of seagrass habitat fragmentation (e.g., patch size) on faunal survival is largely unknown and has been difficult to quantify because seagrass habitat complexity (e.g., shoot density) and patch size are often confounded and vary seasonally. In early summer 1998 we quantified the effect of seagrass habitat fragmentation on juvenile blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) survival in the absence of covarying complexity by exposing tethered crabs to predators in density-controlled, artificial eelgrass (Zostera marina) plots embedded within natural seagrass patches of four broad size classes (<1 m(2) to > 30000 m(2)). We repeated this experiment in late summer 1998 with three different shoot densities, after predictable environmental events (defoliation and bioturbation) had increased seagrass habitat fragmentation and decreased shoot density. In early summer, crab survival was inversely correlated with seagrass patch area; survival of juvenile blue crabs increased as patch size decreased. in contrast to patterns typically observed in terrestrial and marine systems. This pattern appears to have been due to low abundance of adult blue crabs, the chief predator of juvenile conspecifics, in small patches. In late summer, blue crab survival was greater than in early summer, and survival increased with artificial seagrass shoot density but did not vary with patch size. The breakdown of the relationship between crab survival and patch size in late summer may have resulted from influx of cownose rays, which fragmented large, continuous patches of seagrass into smaller patches in midsummer, potentially equalizing fragmentation across the seagrass meadow. These results show that (1) fragmented seagrass landscapes hold significant refuge value for juvenile blue crabs, (2) fragmentation and crab survival vary temporally. and (3) crab survival increases with habitat complexity (shoot density) regardless of patch size. The findings indicate that habitat patch size and complexity jointly drive organismal survival, and that their influence differs temporally in this dynamic landscape. Thus, ecological processes are sensitive to landscape structure, and studies of habitat structure should incorporate multiple scales of space and time, as well as potentially confounding structural variables.

AB Age and size at first reproduction have broad implications for studying population and community ecology. From general functions of body growth we developed models for estimating both age and size at first reproduction when growth trajectories are the only reliable information. We evaluated our models using empirical data, including 85 species of marine and freshwater fishes, with 235 populations or sex groups. From the data set, we found the following two sets of relations. (1) There is a nonlinear negative relation between the von Bertalanffy growth coefficient (K) and the age at first reproduction (T-r). (2) The ratio of body length at first reproduction (L-r) to asymptotic body length (L-inf) may increase in two possible ways: one is increases in K and, consequently, decreases in L-inf; the other is increases in T-r and delay of the age at first reproduction. Our model integrates the above complex relations into a simple linear function. The set of life-history invariants summarized by E. Charnov and by A. L. Jensen is a special case of our model. The pattern of life-history diversification demonstrated by K. O. Winemiller and K. A. Rose is similar to our model implication and the results of our data analysis. Additional information about other complex traits such as mortality and fecundity are not needed in our models, so our models provide an independent basis for testing life-history theories and for applying those theories to modeling population dynamics.

AB The phenomenology and causes of snowshoe hare cycles are addressed via construction of a three-trophic-level population dynamics model in which hare populations are limited by the availability of winter browse from below and by predation from above. In the absence of predators, the model predicts annual oscillations, the magnitude of which depends on habitat quality. With predators in the system, a wide range of additional dynamics are possible: multi-annual cycles of various periods, quasiperiodicity, and chaos. Parameterizing the model from the literature leads to the conclusion that the model is compatible with the principal features of the cycle in nature: its regularity, mean period, and the observed range of peak-to-trough amplitudes. The model also points to circumstances that can result in the cycle's abolition as observed, for example, at the southern edge of the hare's range. The model predicts that the increase phase of the cycle is brought to a halt by food limitation, while the decline from peak numbers is a consequence of predation. This is consistent with factorial field experiments in which hare populations were given supplemental food and partial surcease from predators. The results of the experiments themselves are also reproducible by the model.
   Analysis of the model was carried out using a recently developed method in which the original dynamical system is reformulated as a perturbation of a Hamiltonian limit wherein exist infinite numbers of periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic motions. The periodic orbits are continued numerically into non-Hamiltonian regions of parameter space corresponding to the situation in nature. This procedure allows one to obtain an overall understanding of the geometry of parametric dependencies. The present study represents the first formulation of a full three-trophic-level snowshoe hare model and the first time any model of the cycle has been parameterized entirely using independently measured quantities.

AB Foraging organisms must often balance the conflicting demands of feeding and avoiding predators. I investigated whether the freshwater snail Amnicola limosa trades off obtaining food for reducing the risk of mortality from predatory crayfish (Orconectes). Field surveys and experiments were conducted to determine, first, whether snails altered habitat use when presented with predation risk, and second, whether this behavior had consequences for growth. Surveys of 20 northern Wisconsin lakes revealed that snail occupancy of food-poor macrophytes was positively related land occupancy of food-rich bottom sediments was negatively related) to crayfish abundance. Similarly, in a lake where crayfish (O. rusticus) are abundant, but differentially active among seasons, seasonal sampling indicated that snails occupied sand during the spring period of low crayfish activity but were absent from this habitat during summer. These distributional patterns derive from a combination of active habitat shifts and differential mortality among habitats, as indicated by laboratory experiments and field estimates of snail dispersal rates. Furthermore, aggregation of snails on macrophytes reduces snail growth. The average length of adult snails collected from bottom sediments was greater than the length of snails on macrophytes. Similarly, in the laboratory, snails that migrated up vertical surfaces in response to chemical alarm signals from feeding crayfish exhibited a growth depression. This trade-off of maximum growth rates for increased survival from crayfish by A. limosa likely poses constraints on snail fitness, which, in turn, can affect interactions with other predator species.

AB We tested the prediction from spatial competition models that intraspecific aggregation may promote coexistence and thus maintain biodiversity with experimental communities of four annual species. Monocultures, three-species mixtures, and the four-species mixture were sown at two densities and with either random or intraspecifically aggregated distributions. There was a hierarchy of competitive abilities among the four species. The weaker competitors showed higher aboveground biomass in the aggregated distribution compared to the random distribution, especially at high density. In one species, intraspecific aggregation resulted in an 86% increase in the number of flowering individuals and a 171% increase in the reproductive biomass at high density. The competitively superior species had a lower biomass in the aggregated distribution than in the random distribution at high density. The data support the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of plants profoundly affects competition in such a way that weaker competitors increase their fitness while stronger competitors are suppressed when grown in the neighborhood of conspecifics. This implies that the spatial arrangement of plants in a community can be an important determinant of species coexistence and biodiversity.

AB Assessing the colonizing ability of a species is important for predicting its future distribution or for planning the introduction or reintroduction of that species for conservation purposes. The best way to assess colonizing ability is by making experimental introductions of the species and monitoring the outcome. In this study, different-sized propagules of Roesel's bush-cricket, Metrioptera roeseli, were experimentally introduced into 70 habitat islands, previously uninhabited by the species, in farmland fields in southeastern Sweden. The areas of introduction were carefully monitored for 2-3 yr to determine whether the propagules had successfully colonized the patches. The study showed that large propagules resulted in larger local populations during the years following introduction. Probability of colonization for each propagule size was measured and showed that propagule size had a significant effect on colonization success, i.e., large propagules were more successful in colonizing new patches. If future introductions were to be made with this or a similar species, a propagule size of at least 32 individuals would be required to establish a viable population with a high degree of certainty.

AB Many recent studies have addressed the effects of patch size and isolation on bird communities in highly fragmented landscapes, but the importance of landscape composition in more forested landscapes remains poorly understood. The objectives of our study were (1) to determine the effects of two structurally and temporally distinct disturbance types (agriculture and silviculture) and extent of disturbance (percentage of disturbance within 1.0 km) on avian community structure within forested landscapes, and (2) to investigate underlying mechanisms responsible for associations between landscape composition and avian communities. Differences in microhabitat, microclimate, and nesting success among landscapes were examined as possible mechanisms. Breeding bird communities in central Pennsylvania (USA) were surveyed twice per year during 1997-1999 at 34 sites within contiguous mature forest, which represented a range of disturbance extent (4-59% nonforest cover within 1.0 km). Each site was in a forested landscape containing predominantly agricultural or silvicultural disturbances (n = 17 each). Our results indicate that type of disturbance within landscapes influenced bird community composition and relative abundance more than extent of disturbance. Compared to forests within landscapes disturbed by silviculture, forests within landscapes disturbed by agriculture, irrespective of the extent of disturbance, had fewer forest-associated species, long-distance migrants, forest-canopy and forest-understory-nesting species, and greater numbers of edge-associated species, including avian nest predators and Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater). Fewer species and guilds were associated with the extent of disturbance within a landscape or interactions between disturbance type and extent. Abundances of edge-associated species, residents, and forest-canopy nesters increased with increasing amounts of disturbance within forested landscapes. Local variation in microhabitat and microclimate among landscapes did not explain observed differences in avian community structure. However, nesting success was greater and numbers of some avian and small mammalian nest predators were lower in stands within forested landscapes disturbed by silviculture than in forested landscapes disturbed by agriculture. Nesting success was not associated with the extent of a given disturbance type within landscapes. These results demonstrate that, even within forested landscapes. the types of disturbance can influence avian community structure and, thus, should be considered in conservation and forest management plans. In particular, agricultural disturbances within forested landscapes seemed to negatively affect bird communities in adjacent forests more than silvicultural disturbances. Both species richness and abundance of forest-associated species were greater on sites with higher levels of nesting success. Thus, differences in nesting success resulting from altered interactions between nest predators and nesting birds may be an important underlying mechanism of avian community structure and organization at the landscape scale.

AB Many animals live in temporary or permanent groups. either as gregarious or social species, to reduce predation risk. The solitary midge, Aphidoletes aphidimyza, preys specifically on aphids and spends its entire larval development within a prey colony where it is susceptible to intraguild predation. We hypothesized that midge larvae profit from a dilution effect produced by aphids which enhances their chances of survival. We examined the defensive behaviors of aphids in response to foraging midges, and investigated the effect of aphid density on the predation risk of A. aphidimyza by the lacewing Chrysoperla rufilabris. We found that a foraging midge displays furtive hunting behavior which triggers little defensive reaction by aphids, and does not stimulate significant disturbance of the gregarious prey. Within the aphid colony the midge benefits from a dilution effect which reduces the incidence of predation by lacewing larvae. However, the effectiveness of such a mechanism is determined by the level of disturbance caused by foraging intraguild predators. Large lacewing larvae tend to dislodge aphids from their feeding sites, thereby eliminating the dilution effect. We conclude that prey not only provide food to midge larvae, but also protection against natural enemies.

AB We examined the effects of separate removal experiments of two generalist consumers, the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus), on nest predation rates of forest songbirds. Mice are numerically dominant at our study sites and were shown to be strong predators in other predator-prey interactions, such as those involving gypsy moths. Therefore, we hypothesized that removal of mice would result in decreased levels of nest predation relative to control treatments with a complete predator assemblage, but that the removal of chipmunks would not result in decreased nest predation. Both hypotheses were supported. Mice depredated > 60% of artificial nests in control plots (mouse populations intact), whereas chipmunks depreciated similar to 20%. Daily nest mortality rates in mouse removal treatments were less than half the rates in controls but were virtually identical between chipmunk removal and control treatments. Nonetheless, when we examined predation rates across plots in which the density of mice varied naturally, total daily mortality rates declined as the density of mice increased. This pattern occurred because mortality from non-mouse predators decreased as the density of mice increased and overwhelmed increasing mortality from mice to drive the overall dynamics of the system. Analysis of the relationships between the density of mice and predation rates by mice as a function of the abundance of natural food in their environment revealed probable reasons for these conflicting results. We suggest that high local densities of mice deplete resources for larger, non-mouse predators, which preferentially occupy areas of few mice and high local food abundance. In these areas, songbirds may be faced with higher overall nest predation dominated by non-mouse predators. Mice thus influence nest predation rates through both direct and indirect pathways.

AB Top-down forces, such as grazing and predation, have long been thought to be unimportant in controlling plant growth in salt marshes. Instead, bottom-up forces, such as porewater ammonium and oxygen availability, are thought to be the primary regulating factors. In the field, we observed the periwinkle, Littoraria irrorata, grazing on live saltmarsh cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora. To examine the relative importance of periwinkle grazing and nutrient availability in controlling marsh grass growth, we manipulated snail and nitrogen levels in a season-long field experiment in a Virginia salt marsh.
   Snails differentially affected plant growth at varying nitrogen levels. III unfertilized plots, snail removal increased S. alterniflora aboveground production by 38%, whereas in nitrogen addition plots, snail removal increased cordgrass growth by 78%. Snail addition decreased aboveground production by 51% in unfertilized stands, while in fertilized stands, snail addition led to even greater reductions (66%). By comparison, nitrogen addition increased S. alterniflora production by 443% in snail removal treatments, while in controls and snail addition treatments, fertilization effects were dampened significantly, as nitrogen enrichment increased marsh grass growth by 322% and 189%, respectively.
   Feeding assays examining the rate at which snails ingested live S. alterniflora revealed that snail consumption alone could not be responsible for these large biomass reductions. Experimental results suggest that grazer-induced defoliation and grazer control of plant demand for nitrogen fertilizer were the likely mechanisms involved. A survey of salt marshes from Maryland to Georgia showed that periwinkle grazing on live S. alterniflora is widespread.
   Our results show that L. irrorata can exert strong top-down control of S. alterniflora production, and that this effect increases with increasing nitrogen avaliability. Together, these findings question the widely accepted notion that grazers play a relatively unimportant role in the salt marsh community.

AB Large-scale natural habitat disturbances can play major roles in structuring the distribution of individuals and ecosystems,and can exert substantial selective pressures. The magnitude of these effects depends on the spatial and temporal scale of the disturbance, as well its frequency, intensity, and predictability. In January 1998, the worst ice storm in documented Canadian history struck southern Ontario and Quebec. This storm affected > 10(6) ha of forest, causing widespread damage. One region negatively affected by the storm is home to a large breeding population of Cerulean Warblers, Dendroica cerulea. This population has been studied since 1994, thereby allowing a unique opportunity to examine the effects of a large-scale natural habitat disturbance on the reproductive ecology and behavior of this Neotropical migrant songbird. We addressed two main questions: (1) did Cerulean Warbler reproductive success change after this habitat disturbance, and (2) did the breeding population exhibit a shift in habitat selection patterns in response to this habitat disturbance? The January 1998 ice storm caused a significant reduction in the amount of forest canopy foliage in our study area the following spring. This was followed by a significant decline in Cerulean Warbler reproductive output in the 1998 breeding season. In 1999, Cerulean Warblers demonstrated a significant increase in territory size and a significant shift in nest-site location patterns; these shifts were accompanied by a significant increase in reproductive success. The 1999 shifts in territory and nest-site location patterns were effected by the same individuals who were failed breeders in 1998. This suggests that Cerulean Warblers possess a degree of plasticity in their habitat affinities, and that this plasticity rendered the population somewhat resilient to this particular disturbance.

AB Since there is little known about invertebrates in glacier foreland succession, the aim of this study was (1) to characterize succession patterns of the epigean fauna, (2) to analyze how these are related to plant succession,, and (3) to investigate the influence of locally varying environmental conditions. The Central Alpine glacier foreland of the Rotmoostal (Obergurgl, Tyrol, Austria) was selected as an example situated above the treeline (2280-2450 in above sea level) where a 2 km long deglaciated area covers a chronosequence of 140 yr. The epigean fauna was sampled in 70 plots of all ages and in nearby sites outside the foreland by pitfall trapping over the entire growing season in 1996 (June-October). Abiotic characterization and vegetation recordings were available for all plots.
   Rapid development of pioneer communities over 50 yr was followed by little change in older stages. Further development towards the mature invertebrate communities characteristic of areas outside the foreland only occurred on the sunny slopes near the terminal moraine and proceeded in a qualitatively different way. Sites in the alluvial outwash plain or otherwise physically disturbed were clearly successionally younger than adjacent undisturbed sites. The first colonizers were almost exclusively predators. Herbivores and decomposers appeared later. Similarities and differences between faunal and floral succession patterns are discussed.
   The major factors affecting faunal succession as identified by canonical correspondence analysis were soil formation and vegetation development along the chronosequence. In addition, favorable sun and light conditions may facilitate successional progress. Fauna communities also react to local conditions, most notably to the moisture/snow cover regime, Abiotic environment, architecture of plants, and plant species composition interact strongly as explanatory factors, but all three aspects also contribute significant unique correlations.
   There were no hints of random colonization patterns at the youngest sites. Pioneer invertebrate communities had the same small-scale spatial heterogeneity and equally strong correlations with environmental conditions as did the well-established communities at older sites. This leads to the conclusion that faunal colonization and succession in Alpine glacier forelands, to a large extent, follow predictable and deterministic assembly rules and that stochastic effects are of minor importance.

AB With increasing fragmentation of natural areas and a dramatic reduction of forest cover in several parts of the world, quantifying the impact of such changes on species richness and community dynamics has been a subject of much concern. Here, we tested whether in more fragmented landscapes there was a lower number of area-sensitive species and higher local extinction and turnover rates, which could explain higher temporal variability in species richness. To investigate such potential landscape effects at a regional scale, we merged two independent, large-scale monitoring efforts: the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and the Land Use and Land Cover Classification data from the U.S. Geological Survey.
   We used methods that accounted for heterogeneity in the probability of detecting species to estimate species richness and temporal changes in the bird communities for BBS routes in three mid-Atlantic U.S. states. Forest breeding bird species were grouped prior to the analyses into area-sensitive and non-area-sensitive species according to previous studies. We tested predictions relating measures of forest structure at one point in time (1974) to species richness at that time and to parameters of forest bird community change over the following 22-yr-period (1975-1996). We used the mean size of forest patches to characterize landscape structure, as high correlations among landscape Variables did not allow us to disentangle the relative roles of habitat fragmentation per se and habitat loss.
   As predicted, together with lower species richness for area-sensitive species on routes surrounded by landscapes with lower mean forest-patch size, we found higher mean year-to-year rates of local extinction. Moreover, the mean year-to-year rates of local turnover (proportion of locally new species) for area-sensitive species were also higher in landscapes with lower mean forest-patch size. These associations were not observed for the non-area-sensitive species group.
   These results suggest that landscape structure may influence forest bird communities at regional scales through its effects on the total number of species but also on the temporal rates of change in community composition. Evidence for higher rates of local extinction and turnover in more fragmented landscapes suggests that bird communities function as metapopulations at a regional scale, and points out the importance of colonizations and recolonizations from surrounding landscapes to local community dynamics. Further, our results illustrate that the methods used to estimate the community parameters can be a powerful statistical tool in addressing questions relative to the dynamics of communities.

AB We analyzed 136 time series (covering from 44 to 73 yr) of juvenile cod to estimate the level of direct and delayed density-dependent mortality (DDM) of 11 populations from the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. The parameters were estimated using a modeling approach that explicitly incorporates observation errors, so that we could quantify the density-independent (stochastic) variation in the survival of juvenile cod. Moderate to strong levels of DDM (direct or delayed) were estimated in eight of the 11 populations. Variability in the 0-group (corrected for observation errors) appeared to be large for most of the populations. Substantial stochastic variability in postsettlement survival was also detected in some areas, indicating that stochastic factors are not only important for egg and larval stages, as stated by the match-mismatch hypothesis, but also for juveniles. We show that the variability in these coastal populations is not only regulated as a function of the strength of DDM processes, but also as an interaction between DDM processes and stochastic factors. We finally postulate that local and regional differences in the strengths of the density-dependent and stochastic processes are related to differences in the quantity and quality of the bottom flora coverage, which govern both food availability and shelter for juveniles.

AB We investigated how three co-dominant arctic shrubs (Betula nana, Salix pulchra, and Ledum palustre ssp. decumbens) responded to long-term treatment with N+P fertilizers and greenhouses in a factorial field experiment at Toolik Lake, Alaska. Our goal was to understand the relationship between growth of individuals and species abundance in the community, and the mechanism by which one species achieves dominance under changed environmental conditions. We compared aboveground growth and allocation patterns in individual ramets 15 yr of age with community abundance measured by quadrat harvests. Ramets of all three species substantially increased their stem biomass with fertilization, but the increase was much larger for Betula than for the other two species. In quadrat sampling, only Betula appreciably increased its biomass per unit area with fertilization or greenhouse treatment. For Salix in all treatments, and Ledum in the two fertilizer treatments, ramet density per unit area decreased more than growth of surviving 15-yr-old ramets was promoted, so community biomass of these species declined. In contrast, Betula increased its ramet density in all treatments by producing new shoots from stems older than 15 yr, even though stem mortality was also increased in the two fertilizer treatments.
   Betula increased its growth in part by a major change in allocation, from producing mostly short shoots to producing many more long shoots. As a result, the number of branches and the rate of production of new meristems greatly increased. This developmental plasticity allowed extensive growth that led to development of a dense canopy and imposed light limitation on the other species. The flexible growth strategy of Betula points to the importance of meristem availability and developmental constraints in determining plant response to environmental change. Developmental controls over meristem availability are not usually considered in ecological paradigms for allocation, but they may be useful for predicting plant response to changes in nutrient availability in other ecosystems.

AB We conducted a two-year predator-exclusion study to assess the magnitude and timing of larval predation in non-outbreaking populations of a geometrid moth, Epirrita autumnata. Laboratory-produced newly hatched larvae were placed on the experimental trees which were assigned to five treatments within two larval densities: (1) all predators, including parasitoids, excluded by mesh bag, (2) birds excluded by cage, (3) ants excluded by glue ring, (4) birds and ants excluded, and (5) control without any predator exclusion. Thereafter, larvae were censused every 3-4 d throughout the five-instar larval period.
   Mortality of E. autumnata larvae in these populations was high and mostly due to natural enemies. In control trees, only similar to 10% of larvae survived, while survival was similar to 90% in mesh bags preventing all natural enemies. Bird exclusion significantly improved larval survival, as survival was almost three times higher in trees with cages than in those without cages. On the other hand, ant exclusion did not have any overall effects on larval survival, mostly because ants were only detected in about half of the trees without glue rings. Larvae survived longer in high-density trees from which ants were excluded, but the effect was masked by high mortality, unrelated to ant exclusion, in the Late larval season. The results suggest that the effect of ant predation on survival of E. autumnata larvae may be spatially restricted and not important at a larger scale. The same result applies for crab spiders, as they caused high mortality in similar to 20% of the study trees. Our results emphasize the importance of considering the spatial scale as well as assessing the impact of multiple predators in order to detect predators affecting survival ac the population level.
   Exclusion of all predation had a significantly stronger effect on larval survival than exclusion of birds alone. Further, mortality was highest during the late larval period, when parasitoids emerge. Thus, a large proportion of larval mortality was most likely due to parasitism. Our results suggest that predation by passerine birds and parasitism may contribute to maintenance of low E. autumnata densities by strong suppression of the number of larvae entering the pupal stage.

AB Predicting the ecological and evolutionary significance of hybridization depends on accurate and comprehensive measurements of the relative fitness of hybrid and parental genotypes under realistic environmental scenarios. Although matings between genetically distinct individuals may produce hybrid progeny of lower fitness than matings between genetically similar individuals, this is not always the case. Two species of North American leopard frogs (Rana blairi and R. sphenocephala) hybridize in central Missouri. To examine the relationship between genotypic fitness and the environment, I measured larval fitness components of the two leopard frog species and their interspecific hybrids using transplant experiments in field enclosures. This study was undertaken to compare larval fitness components of R. blairi, R. sphenocephala, and F-1 hybrids in three natural aquatic habitats representative of a natural environmental gradient (prairie, woodland, and river floodplain). Larvae were reared either in single-genotype stands or in mixtures of all three genotypes. There was no evidence of reduced F-1 hybrid larval performance in any environment. In fact. F-1 hybrids metamorphosed larger than R. sphenocephala, but not R. blairi, in the river floodplain habitat. All genotypes produced the highest proportion of individuals surviving and metamorphosing in the floodplain habitat. Thus, hybrid genotypes performed equivalently to or better than their parental species in three aquatic habitat types. Transplant experiments such as these are critical for directly measuring genotype-by-environment interactions and for assessing the role of ecological factors in determining the adaptive potential of natural hybridization.

AB Witness trees recorded in surveyors' notes have been extensively used to describe presettlement forest vegetation throughout eastern North America. Relatively few studies, however, have discussed surveying inconsistencies that could affect the quality of witness-tree data in Colonial metes and bounds surveys. To increase the accuracy of these data, we developed techniques to quantify and mitigate the effects of several irregularities in metes and bounds witness-tree data using Lancaster County southeastern Pennsylvania, USA, as a model. Irregularities included unequal sampling intensities among regions of contrasting topographic relief, and on a finer scale, unequal sampling among landform classes. We mitigated the effects of these inconsistencies by subdividing the study area into physiographic (topographic) sections, and then subdividing each physiographic section into landform classes before witness-tree analysis. Pre-European settlement forests were dominated by Quercus velutina and Q. alba, with Carya spp. in regions of low topographic relief and Castanea dentata in regions of high topographic relief. We then assessed the effects of Native Americans using catchment analysis in which we tallied witness trees within 5 and 7 km of Susquehannock village sites and compared the forest composition to edaphically similar catchment areas of low Native American activity. Elevated frequencies of Carva spp., Juglans spp., and Robinia pseudoacacia, with depressed frequencies of Quercus alba, occurred on sites with a history of Native American occupation, possibly as a result of disturbance or active cultivation. Together, bias-correction techniques and catchment analysis greatly extend the usefulness of witness-tree data by improving methods for evaluating pre- and post-European settlement disturbance on forest change.

AB Streams in deciduous forests undergo marked transitions from light-replete to light-limited ecosystems every spring when leaves emerge on streamside trees. During the course of leaf emergence and enlargement, shade from leaves on streamside trees can reduce photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) falling on the streambed from > 1000 to < 30 mu mol .m(-2).s(-1). In this study, we examined the effects of leaf emergence at multiple levels in two headwater streams in eastern Tennessee. Primary production estimated from both photosynthesis-irradiance measurements of periphyton in the laboratory and whole-steam diurnal oxygen measurements decreased dramatically over the course of canopy closure. Monthly carbon fixation estimates for periphyton in White Oak Creek declined from 354 mug C/cm(2) in April to 66 mug C/cm(2) in June. while carbon fixation in Walker Branch declined from 495 to 168 mug C/cm(2). Periphyton photosynthesis became increasingly efficient at low irradiances (alpha increased more than threefold) as ambient streambed irradiances declined, but this increase in efficiency only partially compensated for the photon scarcity caused by riparian shade. Ecological photosynthetic efficiency (percentage of incident PAR energy fixed by photosynthesis) estimated from static models. whole-stream measurements, and ambient PAR was a negative exponential function of incident PAR, increasing from < 0.3% to 2% during canopy closure. This increase was attributable to (1) inefficient use of the relatively high irradiances before leaf emergence, and (2) greater photoefficiency (increased alpha) at low irradiances after leaf emergence. Nutrient concentrations (dissolved nitrate and phosphate) in both streams increased coincident with leaf emergence, implying a cascade of shade effects through primary producers to abiotic components of the ecosystem. Shade effects also propagated to higher trophic levels: growth rates of grazing snails (Elimia clavaeformis) in both streams decreased substantially from April to June, consistent with modeled decreases in the productivity of their food resource (periphyton). Snail growth rates were almost zero in White Oak Creek and were negative in Walker Branch during summer when streambed PAR was lowest. The multilevel effects of leaf emergence reported in this study accentuate the importance of light variation in aquatic ecosystems and illustrate the close coupling between streams and their surrounding terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Animal responses to habitat boundaries will influence the effects of habitat fragmentation on population dynamics. Although this is an intuitive and often observed animal behavior, the influences of habitat boundaries have rarely been quantified in the field or considered in theoretical models of large scale processes. We quantified movement behavior of the Fender's blue butterfly (Icaricia icarioides fenderi) as a function of distance from host-plant patches. We measured the butterfly's tendency to move toward habitat patches (bias) and their tendency to continue to move in the direction they were already going (correlation). We found that butterflies significantly modify their behavior within 10-22 m from the habitat boundary.
   We used these data to predict large scale patterns of residence time as a function of patch size, using three dispersal models: homogeneous response to habitat, heterogeneous response to habitat, and heterogeneous response to habitat with edge-mediated behavior. We simulated movement for males and females in eight patch sizes (0.1-8 ha) and asked how residence time varies among the models. We found that adding edge-mediated behavior significantly increases the residence of Fender's blue butterflies in their natal patch. Only the model with edge-mediated behavior for females was consistent with independent mark-release-recapture (MRR) estimates of residence time, other models dramatically underestimated residence times, relative to MRR data.

AB Species diversity is a key concept in ecology, yet the mechanisms regulating diversity in most systems are not completely understood. To address this issue, we analyzed the relationship between phytoplankton diversity and limiting resources (N, P, Si, and light) over two summers in three lakes in the Yellowstone (Wyoming, USA) region. Diversity was highly variable along temporal and spatial axes within lakes. We discovered a strong positive correlation between diversity and the number of resources at physiologically limiting levels. Consistent with resource-competition theory, we found the highest diversity to occur when many resources were limiting. Conversely, the lowest diversity occurred when few resources were measured at limiting levels. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that threshold levels of resources (below which growth is limited and above which there is saturation for the resource) appear to exist in the natural environment, and that diversity is regulated in part by absolute levels of resources available to phytoplankton in aquatic systems. Threshold levels are generally in agreement with those determined to be limiting in prior physiological experiments. Consistent with previous observations, among-lake comparisons yielded a significant negative relationship between species diversity and system productivity. This result tentatively supports the hypothesis that the proximity of individual phytoplankton plays a role in the strength of competitive interactions. Our results generally suggest that, even in dynamic environments, where equilibrium conditions are rare, resource competition among phytoplankton is a mechanism by which communities are continually structured.

AB Functional explanations for horns and antlers on female ungulates are conflicting. We tested the hypothesis that such appendages serve in intraspecific competition for resources by analyzing the tendency for female caribou to carry antlers across a 1000 km wide gradient. We predicted that females in populations experiencing more intense or more protracted interference competition, reflected as greater depth and duration of snow cover, would exhibit greater propensity to bear antlers. Among 15 herds in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, the percentage of antlered females was correlated positively with average annual snowfall and mean snow depth at the end of March, and negatively with population density. Our results support the hypothesis that antlers on females provide functional advantages in interference competition for winter food, but that antler possession may decline in instances of higher animal densities and diminished nutritional state.

AB Pathogens can cause substantial mortality of amphibian eggs. If the timing of hatching is phenotypically plastic, embryos could escape from otherwise lethal infections by hatching early. We tested this with the arboreal eggs of red-eyed treefrogs, Agalychnis callidryas. A filamentous ascomycete (Dothideales: Phaeosphaeriaceae) was present on similar to7% of egg clutches collected from a pond in the rain forest in Panama and, when present, killed 40% of the eggs, on average. Inoculation experiments confirmed that the fungus attacked and killed healthy embryos, establishing that this fungus is a pathogen of A. callidryas eggs. As predicted from life history theory, embryos hatched earlier from both naturally infected and inoculated clutches than from fungus-free control clutches. Within infected clutches, live embryos in contact with fungal hyphae hatched before those embryos not in contact with the fungus. Accelerated hatching allowed embryos to survive that otherwise would have been killed, and tadpoles hatched from infected clutches were themselves uninfected. Red-eyed treefrog embryos also hatch early if attacked by predators, apparently in response to vibratory cues. Because fungal infection provides no vibratory stimuli, embryos must respond to different cues in fungus-induced hatching than in predator-induced hatching. The behavioral decision of when to hatch is complex and merits further investigation. Our study indicates that pathogens can influence the timing of life history transitions, as do other stage-specific risks.

AB Bill size and shape of Western Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma californica) vary,geographically in relation to habitat. Scrub-jays occupying pinyon-juniper woodlands ("pine" scrub-jays) have relatively long, shallow bills, while scrub-jays occupying oak woodlands ("oak" scrub-jays) have relatively, stout, decurved bills. We captured five pine and five oak scrub-jays, and submitted them to feeding trials on pinyon pine (Pinus monophylla) cones and acorns (Quercus agrifolia) to determine whether geographic variation in bill structure was adaptive for foraging on these critical food resources. Three lines of evidence indicated that scrub-jays occuring in habitat dominated by either pinyon pine or oak had adaptive bill structure. First, scrub-jays exhibited a steep trade-off in feeding performance on pine cones and acorns. Pine scrub-jays extracted and consumed pinyon seeds more than 30% faster than did oak scrub-jays. Oak scrub-jays penetrated and consumed acorns twice as fast as pine scrub-jays did. Second, measures of feeding performance were moderately to strongly correlated with different measures of bill structure. Third, bill shape as measured by the ratio of bill length to depth was the metric that (1) best accounted for variation in feeding rates and (2) was related to the relative amount of pine and oak in habitats of 12 different populations of scrub-jays. These results, as well as others, were consistent with observed geographic variation in scrub-jays.

AB The effects of natural or experimental environmental perturbations on populations can be diverse, simultaneously affecting several life history variables. Population-level responses to such influences frequently are measured as changes in projected population growth rate (lambda). Sensitivity and elasticity analyses can be used to quantify the potential influence of small changes in different life history variables on lambda. When a population is subjected to an experimental treatment, life table response experiment (LTRE) analysis allows decomposition of changes in lambda into contributions due to observed changes in individual life history variables. We investigated the potential and actual influence of demographic characteristics (age at maturity, juvenile and adult survival, fertility, and age at last reproduction) on lambda of Uinta ground squirrels (Spermophilus armatus) in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah, USA. Ground squirrels were studied in three different habitats, before and after an experimental reduction of population size. Survival and reproduction of squirrels increased in response to a reduction in population density. Consequently. lambda increased by at least 21% in two of the three habitats. Population growth rate was potentially most sensitive to changes in age at maturity (alpha) and fertility. LTRE analysis revealed that at did not change and contributed nothing to changes in lambda, but changes in fertility were large and contributed most to observed changes in lambda. Age at last reproduction (omega) increased after density reduction but contributed little to observed changes in lambda because of low sensitivity of lambda to changes in omega. Thus, there was little correspondence between potential influence and actual contributions to observed changes in lambda. We concluded that some demographic variables, notably alpha, had little environmental or phylogenetic scope for reduction, whereas fertility and to some degree survival rates were considerably more plastic under the experimental treatment. Because LTRE analysis incorporates observed changes in life history variables and also sensitivity of lambda to these changes, it worked well for quantifying the response of Uinta ground squirrel populations to density manipulation and holds promise for evaluating alternative management strategies in conservation biology.

AB We investigated changes in UV attenuation and macrozooplankton community structure in a set of lakes along a deglaciation chronosequence in Glacier Bay Alaska. Terrestrial succession in the watersheds of these lakes results in increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content over time. Due to the primary role of DOC in controlling UV attenuation in lakes, one would suspect a gradient in UV attenuation and potentially zooplankton community structure in lakes of different ages. Field measurements of UV in seven lakes of different ages revealed that UV attenuation depths (1% of surface irradiance at 320 nm) ranged from 0.6 m in the oldest lake in the set (90 yr old), to more than 14 m in the youngest lake (10 yr old). Zooplankton community structure also changed across lakes of different ages. Patterns of distribution and abundance of the zooplankton both among and within lakes were consistent with the hypothesis that UV influences zooplankton community structure, The major differences in species composition among lakes were the absence of two primarily epilimnetic species (Asplanchna priodonta and Ceriodaphnia quadrangula) in all but the oldest lake. and the absence of Bosmina longirostris in the four youngest lakes. Transplant experiments in which UV radiation was manipulated in.situ revealed that all three of these "delayed colonizer" species perish within only a. few days when exposed to UV levels found in the surface waters (0.5 m depth) of the youngest lake. The strong dependence of UV radiation transparency on terrestrially derived DOC suggests: a linkage between development of terrestrial plant communities within the watershed, changes in lake hydrology, and the early succession of zooplankton communities following deglaciation.

AB Ecologists are familiar with two data structures commonly used to represent landscapes. Vector-based maps delineate land cover types as polygons, while raster lattices represent the landscape as a grid. Here we adopt a third lattice data structure, the graph. A graph represents a landscape as a set of nodes (e.g., habitat patches) connected to some degree by edges that join pairs of nodes functionally (e.g., via dispersal). Graph theory is well developed in other fields, including geography (transportation networks, routing applications. siting problems) and computer science (circuitry and network optimization). We present an overview of basic elements of graph theory as it might be applied to issues of connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes, focusing especially on applications of metapopulation theory in conservation biology. We develop a general set of analyses using a hypothetical landscape mosaic of habitat patches in a nonhabitat matrix. Our results suggest that a simple graph construct. the minimum spanning tree, can serve as a powerful guide to decisions about the relative importance of individual patches to overall landscape connectivity. We then apply this approach to an actual conservation scenario involving the threatened Mexican Spotted Owl(Strix occidentalis lucida). Simulations with an incidence-function metapopulation model suggest that population persistence can be maintained de spite substantial losses of habitat area, so long as the minimum spanning tree is protected. We believe that graph theory has considerable promise for applications concerned with connectivity and ecological flows in general. Because the theory is already well developed in other disciplines, it might be brought to bear immediately on pressing ecological applications in conservation biology and landscape ecology.

AB Data sets in which animals are identified individually in different places and times may contain considerable information on movements. However, if the probability that an animal is reidentified depends on its movement pattern, then standard methods of analyzing movement are not applicable. I show that modifications of maximum likelihood methods, in which the identifications themselves establish the spatial and temporal distribution of effort, can be used to derive movement parameters in three situations: (1) Identifications in one location allow calculation of the "lagged identification rate" (the probability of reidentification after various time lags) as well as estimation of residence times inside, and outside, the study area. (2) When more than one study area is sampled, it is possible to derive lagged identification rates between them and to estimate movement rates between areas and other population parameters. (3) Movements through continuous space can be described by diffusion rates (rates of population spread), and plots of squared displacement against time lag. To simplify computation, and to permit the analysis of large data sets, summed nonindependent log-likelihoods can be maximized in place of the true log-likelihood to obtain approximately unbiased parameter estimates, and binomial, multinomial, or hypergeometric models can be approximated by the Poisson distribution. The first and third of the techniques were verified using simulated data, and all were applied to a 13-yr data set of identifications of sperm whales in the South Pacific Ocean. Residence times in waters close to the Galapagos Islands were of the order of 8 d, but during the study period there was a substantial net movement out of the Galapagos region and into waters of the coastal eastern tropical Pacific. Diffusion rates of sperm whales were similar to 700 km(2)/d over time scales from 1 to 100 d but decreased considerably over time scales of years, indicating displacements of similar to 50 km/d within home ranges spanning similar to 1000 km. Although giving relatively imprecise estimates of movement parameters compared to more standard methods, the techniques considered here should be particularly useful when examining animal movements over long time scales.

AB Interactions among plants, soil, hydrology, and microbes regulate nutrient cycling and loss in ecosystems. Variability among these factors is likely to regulate patterns of productivity and N cycling along topographic gradients in forest and other terrestrial ecosystems. Our objectives were to determine interrelations among spatial and temporal patterns in microbial biomass, N transformation rates (net N mineralization, net nitrification, denitrification potential) and soil, plant, and stream variables along an elevational gradient (525-775 m) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), a northern hardwood forest in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, USA. We examined these relationships in the forest floor (O-e and O-a horizons) and upper mineral soil to assess the contribution of these different layers to overall microbial biomass and N cycling rates and to examine potential differences among soil layers in the spatial and temporal variation of these soil charecteristics and their correlations with one another. Broad patterns in microbial biomass and N transformation rates were correlated in space and time and varied with elevation, soil horizon, season, and year. Both microbial biomass and N cycling activities were greater in summer than in fall or spring, although the magnitude of seasonal differences was much greater for the N cycling activities than for microbial biomass. Nitrification rates and denitrification enzyme activity were greatest at the highest elevation site, despite the predominance of beech (Fagus grandifolia) in the canopy at that site, which would be expected to inhibit these activities. Differences among years in precipitation may have driven annual variation in N transformation rates, which were correlated with annual variation in litter N content. Elevational patterns in nitrification were broadly correlated with elevational patterns in stream nitrate (NO3-) concentration, suggesting an important link between soil N transformations and nutrients in stream water along this elevational gradient. These results indicate that interactions among plant communities, soil characteristics, and soil microbial communities determine spatial and temporal patterns of N transformations, which are potentially linked to variation in stream nutrient concentrations and outputs at the watershed scale in these northern hardwood forest ecosystems.

AB Stable-isotope ratios of carbon (C-13/C-12 or delta C-13) have been widely used to determine the energy base of stream food webs, but such use is controversial due to unexplained variability in algal delta C-13. I used published delta C-13 data from temperate headwater streams through medium-sized rivers (0.2-4000 km(2) watershed area) collected during summer baseflows and original data from streams in northern California to analyze energy pathways through river food webs. The analyses showed three important results. First, epilithic algal delta C-13 and watershed area are positively related, suggesting that effects of carbon Limitation on algal carbon uptake result in C-13 enrichment of algal delta C-13 in larger, more productive rivers. Second, epilithic algae and terrestrial detritus delta C-13 values are often distinct in small shaded streams but overlap in some larger unshaded streams and rivers. Measurements of delta C-13 values may be most useful in distinguishing algal and terrestrial energy sources in unproductive streams with supersaturated dissolved CO, concentrations, and some productive rivers where CO, concentrations are low relative to photosynthetic rates. Finally, consumer delta C-13 values are more strongly related to algal delta C-13 than terrestrial delta C-13. The relative contribution of terrestrial and algal carbon sources often varied by functional feeding group within and between sites. However, with the exception of shredders and scrapers, which respectively relied on terrestrial and algal carbon sources, patterns of consumer delta C-13 clearly show a transition from terrestrial to algal carbon sources for many lotic food webs in streams with greater than or equal to 10 km(2) watershed area. The observed transition to algal carbon sources is likely related to increasing primary production rates as forest canopy cover declines in larger streams, although decreasing retention or quality of terrestrial carbon may also play a role. Improved analyses of algal delta C-13 and delta N-15 combined with quantitative study of organic matter dynamics and food web structure should allow the relative importance of these factors to be distinguished in future food web studies.

AB Spatial and temporal variability influence the structure and dynamics of perennial plant populations. In order to investigate the consequences of this environmental heterogeneity on population and life history traits of a perennial plant with a complex life history, four size-classified population matrix models were employed (i.e., annual, mean, periodic, and stochastic simulations) in a clonal cactus, Opuntia rastrera, in the Chihuahuan Desert, Mexico. This species was studied over a seven-year period in two contrasting, neighboring habitats (nopalera and grassland). The specific aims were: (a) to assess the effect of annual environmental variability on the long-term dynamics of both populations; and (b) to estimate the relative contribution of sexual reproduction and clonal propagation to the populations' rates of increase. Projections from each model provided complementary information on population dynamics and life history in the two habitats. The finite rate of population growth (lambda) varied among matrix projections. Mean, periodic, and stochastic projections yielded lambda > 1 for nopalera and lambda approximate to 1 for grassland. The relative contributions of size classes and demographic processes to changes in lambda differed widely between years and habitats for annual matrices. In contrast, elasticities of periodic matrices showed a stable habitat-dependent pattern. The proportional change in lambda produced by sexual recruitment and clonal propagation showed wide spatial variation in which the most distinctive difference between habitats was the predominance of clonal recruitment at the nopalera and seedling recruitment at the grassland. Elasticities also showed temporal variation whereby clonal propagation decreased as precipitation increased, while sexual reproduction and growth tended to increase with precipitation. The striking spatial and temporal differences found in the structure, dynamics, and life history traits of O. rastrera are aptly summarized by the periodic analyses. These differences reflect both the varying influence of the selective pressures operating on this species and the ways in which demographic plasticity deals with them.

AB Tree islands or krummholz found above tree line in the Front Range of Colorado are of interest because of their ability to migrate across the tundra landscape. This unique characteristic is caused by dieback of exposed, windward plant tissues, growth of the plant to the leeward, and the ability of these plants to produce new roots from branches buried in organic debris. This mobility also allows for the study of tree-induced changes on properties of soils initially formed by tundra vegetation. Soil characteristics, root productivity, decomposition of litter, and nitrogen flux in soils beneath mobile tree islands and adjacent alpine meadow tundra were studied to test whether tree islands modify the physical and chemical properties of soils formed in alpine tundra. Rates of surface decomposition of a standardized litter substrate were significantly increased leeward of tree islands and significantly decreased within these islands. Soil pH was not significantly reduced by tree island passage. We found significant reductions in amounts of soil organic matter (SOM) and KCl-extractable NH4+ in soils influenced by tree islands. No recovery in soil organic matter or NH4+ was observed at locations that correspond to 250-500 yr since the passage of a tree island. Cation exchange capacity was correlated with percentage SOM but was not reduced by tree island passage. Soil texture differences, when present, did not support the hypothesis that surface soils lose clay content with tree island passage but were consistent with a reduction in the depth of the A horizon of these locations.
   The soil carbon isotopic signature (delta C-13) is only temporarily influenced by the passage of tree islands, suggesting that tree carbon is not stabilized in soils. Moreover while trees have numerous roots within the O horizon of soil, root ingrowth bags demonstrated large reductions in fine root production in the A horizons beneath trees (149 g.m(-2).yr-(1) in tundra vs. 25 g.m(-2).yr(-1) beneath trees). Resin bag nitrogen collections indicated that soils beneath trees had higher NH4+ losses than adjacent tundra soils. Tree island passage therefore reduced SOM and the nitrogen storage potential of former tundra soils, and these effects likely persist for centuries following the passage of a tree island.

AB Mark-recapture statistics have rarely been applied to plants, yet they can be useful for estimating plant demographic traits where individuals may be missed or unobservable. We applied mark-recapture statistics based on an information theory approach to estimate annual probabilities of dormancy in a five-year study of a threatened, perennial plant, the small yellow lady's slipper orchid (Cypripedium calceolus ssp. parviflorum (Salisb.) Fernald). The aboveground states of 548 genets in eight patches were monitored over five years. Apparent survival probabilities (phi), corrected for dormancy, were calculated. The best-fit model suggested that apparent survival was constant throughout the study for all patches, while dormancy varied additively with time among patches. The mean probability of dormancy was 0.320 +/- 0.024, with a mean maximum overestimation of 0.067 as calculated using an estimate of the probability of detection. Dormancy typically lasted for no longer than two consecutive years, although dormancy as long as four years was observed. Dormancy displayed a strong covariate relationship with spring frost days, although effects of precipitation and mean spring temperature were almost equally strong. Mean apparent survival probabilities were high in each patch (phi = 0.878), but dormancy probabilities varied considerably among patches (d = 0.188-0.672). Conventional resprouting probabilities underestimated apparent survival by a mean difference of 0.288 (range: 0.150-0.589). This novel application of mark-recapture statistics to plant demography allowed robust survival estimates that accounted for uncertainty due to an unobservable, dormant life stage.

AB Riparian zones often act as nutrient filters, removing NO3 from water flowing through riparian soils. The role of vegetation in NO3 retention remains unclear and may be direct (uptake) or indirect (stimulation of microbial activity). We studied the riparian shrub Baccharis salicifolia (seepwillow) in Sycamore Creek (Arizona, USA), to determine (1) if sites colonized by seepwillow were sinks for NO3, and (2) the mechanism by which seepwillow causes NO3 retention. Subsurface water was sampled along flowpaths from an uncolonized gravel bar through seepwillow sites at several depths and on several gravel bars. NO3 concentration was significantly lower in seepwillow sites than in uncolonized sites, at least to 20 cm below the water table. Predictions of three hypotheses were tested to explain NO3 losses: (H1) by plant uptake, (H2) by stimulation of denitrification by seepwillow, and (H3) a prior condition unrelated to seepwillow. Six experiments were used to test these hypotheses, Transplant experiments, plant size relationships, and root distribution experiments all demonstrated the importance of seepwillow (rejection of H3). Other tests involving removal of aboveground biomass, denitrification measures, and mass balance calculations showed a predominance of denitrification over uptake (rejection of H1). We conclude that the main effect of seepwillow is to produce organic matter creating conditions favorable to denitrification and a loss of NO3 from subsurface water. Since denitrification is a permanent loss of N to the atmosphere, and uptake only temporarily retains N, the interaction between plants and microbes has important implications for the maintenance of water quality in streams and downstream reservoirs.

AB A general model in thermal ecology predicts that ectotherms should stop thermoregulating when the costs outweigh the benefits. Support for this model comes from studies of warm-temperate species, but the extent to which the model can be extrapolated to species living in climatic extremes is unknown, because of the lack of information regarding the thermoregulatory behavior of such species. We tested the applicability of this cost-benefit model using data for black rat snakes (Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta) studied at the northern extreme of their range in Ontario. During 1997-1999, we used automated temperature-sensitive radiotelemetry to collect similar to 150000 body temperatures from 53 free-ranging rat snakes. Simultaneously, we used physical models of snakes to measure the environmental operative temperatures available to black rat snakes, and we determined their preferred body temperature range in a laboratory thermal gradient. The mostly forested habitats inhabited by rat snakes in Ontario were more thermally challenging than the habitats of other species studied to date. The preferred body temperature ranges of mate, nongravid female, and gravid female black rat snakes were not significantly different (preferred body temperature averaged across all individuals, 28.1 degreesC). However, free-ranging gravid females tended to maintain higher body temperatures in order to thermoregulate more effectively as well as exploit their thermal environment more than males and nongravid females. This difference was most pronounced during the day and prior to egg laying, and constituted the first documentation of such a phenomenon in an oviparous snake. Black rat snakes had indices of thermoregulation effectiveness similar to other species but tended to exploit opportunities for thermoregulation less. Overall, our data provided support that was at best ambiguous for the current cost-benefit thermoregulation model, suggesting that this model may generally be less applicable to species inhabiting climatic extremes. We propose that, for species in extreme climates, the costs associated with thermoconformity may be more important than previously recognized, We identified several problems associated with the index of thermoregulation effectiveness used by previous researchers, and we propose a mathematically simpler alternative that circumvents these problems. We also make recommendations regarding the future use of the various indices of thermoregulation developed in recent years.

AB A predator's per capita feeding rate on prey, or its functional response, provides a foundation for predator-prey theory. Since 1959, Holling's prey-dependent Type II functional response, a model that is a function of prey abundance only, has served as the basis for a large literature on predator-prey theory. We present statistical evidence from 19 predator-prey systems that three predator-dependent functional responses (Beddington-DeAngelis, Crowley-Martin, and Hassell-Varley), i.e., models that are functions of both prey and predator abundance because of predator interference, can provide better descriptions of predator feeding over a range of predator-prey abundances. No single functional response best describes all of the data sets. Given these functional forms., we suggest use of the Beddington-DeAngelis or Hassell-Varley model when predator feeding rate becomes independent of predator density at high prey density and use of the Crowley-Martin model when predator feeding rate is decreased by higher predator density even when prey density is high.

AB For organisms with complex life histories, processes occurring during transitions between stages can strongly affect population dynamics. The major life history transition for many marine species is settlement from pelagic larvae to benthic or demersal juveniles. We examined differential mortality at settlement as a function of early life history traits (size-at-age, growth rates) in three cohorts of two common Caribbean coral reef fishes, Thalassoma bifasciatum and Halichoeres bivittatus (Labridae). We deployed light traps to collect late-stage larvae of each cohort. We also collected juveniles of each cohort at regular intervals (every second day) for two weeks following their first appearance on the nearshore reefs of Barbados, West Indies, during the spring (April-May) and fall (August-October) of 1997. Comparisons' of otolith-derived traits exhibited by younger recruits (initial group) to those exhibited by older juveniles (survivor group) revealed that there was a difference in otolith growth during metamorphosis for both species: survivors had wider metamorphic bands. In addition, surviving H. bivittatus exhibited higher larval growth rates than settlers, while surviving T. bifasciatum had higher juvenile growth during the first day following emergence onto the reef. Differences in otolith growth rates in the absence of similar changes in somatic size indicate that mortality may have acted upon a growth-based characteristic of condition. We hypothesize that larvae Settling in better physiological condition differentially survived the early juvenile period. Finally, selective mortality appeared to be greatest during a relatively brief window of time surrounding metamorphosis, indicating that this is a critical period. These results point to the demographic importance of transitional periods between stages for animals with complex life cycles. Furthermore, traits exhibited by earlier stages can significantly influence survival during these transitional periods.

AB Animal movement and dispersal can be described as a correlated random walk dependent on three parameters: number of steps, step size, and distribution of random turning angles. Equations of Kareiva and Shigesada use the parameters to predict the mean square displacement distance (MSDD), but this is less meaningful than the mean dispersal distance (MDD) about which the population would be distributed. I found that the MDD can be estimated by multiplying the square root of the MSDD by a three-dimensional surface correction factor obtained from simulations. The correction factors ranged from 0.89 to 1 depending on the number of steps and the variation in random turns, expressed as the standard deviation of the turning angles (SDA) about 0 degrees (straight ahead). Corrected equations were used to predict MDDs for bark beetles, butterflies, ants, and beetles (based on parameters from the literature) and the nematode Steinernema carocapasae (Weiser). Another equation from the literature finds the MDD directly, and this agreed with the MDD obtained by simulation at some combinations of SDA and numbers of steps. However. the equation has an error that increases as a power function when the standard deviation of turning angles becomes smaller (e.g., <6 degrees at 1000 steps or < 13 degrees at 250 steps). Lower numbers of steps also increase the error. Equivalent values of AMT tangle of maximum turn) in uniform random models and of SDA in normal random models were found that allowed these two models to yield similar MDD values. The step size and turning angle variation of animal paths during dispersal and host and mate starching were investigated and found to be correlated; thus, use of different measured step sizes gives consistent estimates of the MDD.

AB Although insight into local and regional factors that structure communities is growing, the specific contribution of each of these factors generally remains unknown. Moreover, the extent to which community assembly is intrinsically indeterministic (i.e., the degree to which community composition depends on chance events) remains an open question. The complexity of this issue argues for field studies in a semicontrolled environment. We studied species richness and community composition of a guild of phreatophytes along dendritic networks of small forest streams in western Belgium. The streams, situated at the forest-covered headwaters of six different watersheds and characterized by homogeneous environmental conditions, impose spatial dispersal constraints to the plant species. This allowed us to assess the relative importance of deterministic processes guiding community assembly. More specifically, we focused on the role of species migration and colonization processes relative to local processes (competitive exclusion and passive habitat selection) on species richness and on community composition. Our analyses at three consecutive levels (species number, community composition, and species) revealed that plant community assembly along the stream systems is based on (1) historical and stochastic colonization events of species and (2) subsequent deterministic downstream dispersal processes. Apparently, due to the influence of historical chance events, deterministic processes do not necessarily result in community convergence. In addition we show that continuous downstream dispersal and colonization can compensate for local extinction processes. This is another piece of evidence that, when studying community composition, it is absolutely necessary to place communities in their spatial contexts.

AB We studied the effects of lizard size, and availability of C-3 and C-4 plants, on stable carbon-isotope (delta C-13) ratios of lizards in an Amazonian savanna. Availability of C-3 and C-4 plants was estimated from 500-point quadrats in each of 38 plots of 3.75 ha. Ratios of delta C-13 in muscle tissue were used to estimate the contribution:, of C-3- and C-4-based food chains to the diets of four species of lizards: Cnemidophorus lemiscatus, Kentropyx slriata, Ameiva ameiva, and Anolis auratus. The relative contributions of C-3 and C-4 plants to the diets of the lizards were affected by the extent of shrub cover in C. lemniscatus, A. auratus, and possibly in K. striata. However, there was a strong effect of lizard size among and within lizard species. These results are at variance with a previous evaluation of diet overlap among size classes of these species that was based on overlap in prey taxonomic categories. This indicates that species and/or size classes of predators on arthropods may obtain their energy from food chains based on different autotrophic sources. despite high overlap in the taxonomic categories of prey.

AB Pollination restricted to a guild of visitors is central to the concept of pollination syndromes. However, there is limited quantitative evidence that the pollination of plants exhibiting certain pollination syndromes is actually dominated by the expected guild of pollinators. We determined the importance of the sole hummingbird species in eastern North America, the Ruby-throat, Archilochus colubris, and invertebrate visitors as pollinators of Silene virginica, which exhibits traits commonly associated with hummingbird pollination. We quantified the role of either type of visitor as pollinators by comparing female reproductive success of plants that were allowed free access by all visitors to female reproductive success of caged plants that were restricted to pollination by invertebrates (small bees and flies, and in one year Bombus spp.). Spatial and temporal variation in the role of either type of pollinator was documented by comparing the female reproductive success of caged and control plants in two nearby sites for five years. In general we found that hummingbirds are the predominant pollinator of S. virginica, but there is considerable spatiotemporal variation in their role. We discuss the importance of understanding the role of hummingbirds as potential selective agents of S. virginica floral traits within the greater community context of other potential pollinators.

AB Behavioral interactions between coexisting species may reflect underlying ecological interactions or may arise from factors unrelated to ecological interactions between species. We examined behavioral interactions between two coexisting, migratory wood warblers that competitively interact on breeding territories in central Arizona, USA. The larger Orange-crowned Warbler (Vermivora celata) is aggressive toward the later-arriving Virginia's Warbler (V. virginiae) and responds to playback of Virginia's Warbler songs by approaching the playback speaker or by singing over Virginia's Warbler songs. Virginia's Warblers retreat from interactions with Orange-crowned Warblers and avoid the playback speaker when presented with Orange-crowned Warbler songs. Responses of both species to song playback of the opposite species differed from responses to conspecific songs, indicating that behavioral interactions do not result from misdirected intraspecific aggression. Behavioral responses were consistent with observed ecological interactions between the two species and suggest that asymmetrical behavioral aggression by the dominant Orange-crowned Warbler may be an important mechanism for competitive interactions involving nest sites. These results support previous studies that have used behavioral experiments to infer ecological interactions among coexisting species. While Orange-crowned Warblers may benefit from aggressively excluding Virginia's Warblers from preferred nest sites, limited data on Virginia's Warbler settlement patterns suggest that Virginia's Warblers do not avoid settling on Orange-crowned Warbler territories. Similar reproductive success in sympatric vs, allopatric habitats suggests little consequence for Virginia's Warblers settling with Orange-crowned Warblers, despite increased reproductive success of Virginia's Warblers in sympatric habitat when Orange-crowned Warblers were experimentally removed.

AB Communities of coexisting organisms are formed by both dispersal among habitat patches in a region and local interactions within patches. The supply of colonists from the regional pool has the potential to alter the outcome of local interactions by providing species that fill different ecological roles. I examined the consequences of invasion by fish (juvenile Lepomis macrochirus) and insect (Notonecta undulata) predators on experimental plankton communities that were either connected to or isolated from the regional pool of zooplankton species. The effects of predators on zooplankton composition and diversity depended on dispersal by members of the regional zooplankton species pool. Fish and notonectids reduced the abundance of large zooplankton and thereby facilitated invasion by new species from the surrounding region. Both predators reduced zooplankton species richness in the absence of dispersal, while fish had positive effects and notonectids had no effects with rapid dispersal. Fish facilitated invasion by more species than they excluded, while similar numbers of species invaded with notonectids as were driven extinct. The effects of predators on planktonic trophic structure (zooplankton size structure and biomass. phytoplankton biomass) were independent of the level of dispersal. Both predators reduced zooplankton mean body size, but only fish enhanced phytoplankton density. Invasion by members of the regional species pool slightly increased zooplankton mean body size and reduced phytoplankton biomass however, the effects were small and independent of the predator treatment. Predator-facilitated invasion of new species altered the effects of predators on zooplankton species composition and diversity, but not on plankton trophic structure. The results suggest that spatial heterogeneity in predator abundance promotes regional coexistence among zooplankton. Connection to a diverse regional species pool via dispersal may therefore be important for determining the impact of local interactions such as predation on communities.

AB Two independent experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of rhizosphere bacteria on the growth of Anthoxanthum odoratum and Panicum sphaero-carpon. We tested whether host-specific populations of Bacillus mycoides affected the growth of their Anthoxanthum and Panicum hosts and whether host-specific differences in Bacillus populations modified the strong detrimental effect of the root fungal pathogen, Pythium macrosporum. Our results showed both positive and negative effects of Bacillus inoculation and that Anthoxanthum and Panicum plants responded differently to Bacillus isolates that originated from different host plants. Anthoxanthum grew relatively better with isolates from Panicum, while Panicum grew relatively better with isolates from Anthoxanthum, consistent with a negative feedback. In both experiments Pythium infection was detrimental to plant growth, and Panicum was more negatively affected by inoculation with Pythium. Overall, Bacillus ameliorated the pathogenic effect of Pythium. However, there was no evidence that host-specific Bacillus populations had different effects on the interaction between these plant species and Pythium. Both host-specific differences in rhizosphere bacteria and host-specific accumulation of a fungal pathogen can generate negative feedback between these two plant species.

AB In food webs based on primary production, biomass of organisms within trophic levels can be simultaneously controlled by resources (bottom-up) and consumers (top-down). In contrast, very little is known about top-down and bottom-up control in detritus-based food webs. Here, we tested whether exclusion of macroconsumers (fishes and shrimps) and/or phosphorus (P) addition affected insect detritivore biomass and decay rate and quality of leaf detritus in a tropical stream. Four treatments were established in a third-order stream in Costa Rica: (1) macroconsumers present, ambient P; (2) macroconsumers excluded, ambient P; (3) macroconsumers present, P added; (4) macroconsumers excluded, P added. Biomass of insect larvae inhabiting leaf packs and mass loss of leaves were measured after 7 and 10 d in situ. After 10 d, biomass and density of insect larvae increased as a result of both P addition and exclusion of macroconsumers. Chironomids (Diptera, Chironominae) were the dominant detritivores in leaf packs, comprising 51-80% of total invertebrate biomass and were responsible for the observed treatment effects. Mass loss rates of leaf packs were accelerated by the presence of macroconsumers but not by P addition. Positive effects of P on insects presumably occurred through increased microbial carbon relative to leaf carbon. However, percentage nitrogen (N), C:N, and fungal biomass of leaves were not affected by either experimental treatment. Laboratory growth studies corroborated positive effects of P on chironomids: growth rates were higher in high-P treatments (high-P stream water and low-P stream water with P added) vs. low-P stream water. However, no differences in the in situ growth rates were observed between a high-and a low-P stream.
   The relative importance of top-down and bottom-up effects was evaluated using several indices. Loss rates of organic matter were affected more by top-down effects of macroconsumers than by bottom-up effects of P. Macroconsumers had negative effects on two trophic levels, contrary to food-web theory predicting alternating negative and positive effects. Positive bottom-up effects of P on insect biomass were greater than negative top-down effects of macroconsumers. In addition, P effects on invertebrates were similar in direction but greater in magnitude than previously published effects of nutrients on consumers in food webs based on primary producers. These results suggest that the impacts of nutrient enrichment on detritivores may be as great or greater than those previously observed on herbivores.

AB For marine algae, the relative importance of recruitment and post-recruitment processes in determining population abundance is not well understood. We documented patterns of recruitment and post-recruitment mortality for a common. clonally reproducing subtidal red alga from southeastern Australia, Delisea pulchra, and used a combination of empirical analyses and population simulations to assess the relative importance of the two processes to local population abundance. Using a hierarchical sampling design consisting of two depths and two spatial scales (quadrats and sites) within each depth. we followed monthly cohorts from recruitment to adulthood (6 mo of age). Recruitment of D. pulchra varied significantly in space and time and was generally decoupled from local adult abundance. Mortality was consistently high, particularly in the deep sites where only 1 of 291 plants survived > 5 mo, and in the shallow sites when high densities of grazing sea urchins were present. Both early (1 mo) and late (6 mo) post-recruitment mortality of monthly cohorts were density independent at both spatial scales examined. Despite this pattern of mortality, variation in recruitment explained a significant amount of the subsequent variation in adult abundance in only 3 out of 10 cohorts at both spatial scales. This result indicates that high density-independent mortality was often important in determining adult abundance for individual cohorts. However. cumulative (across cohorts) recruitment into sites and quadrats over the entire study period explained a significant amount of the variation in the total number of plants that survived to reproduce there. Simulation models based on the measured demography of D. pulchra examined how the relative importance of recruitment and survivorship to population growth changed under two categories of sea urchin density: low (< 80 urchins/m(2)) and high (> 80 urchins/m(2)). These two categories represented the densities of sea urchins above and below a transition point where the mortality of D. pulchra went from being relatively low (17-33%/mo) to very high (63%/mo). When the effects of high densities of sea urchins were simulated, they caused a 95% decline in the population abundance of D. pulchra, compared to only a 31% decline when there were low densities of urchins. Significantly, the relative importance of recruitment and survivorship varied with sea urchin density: when there were high densities of sea urchins, population growth was more sensitive to increases in recruitment. whereas when there were low densities of urchins. survivorship was more important. Our findings demonstrate that the local population abundance of D. pulchra is determined by a combination of recruitment and density-independent mortality following recruitment, but it appears that the relative importance of the two processes varies in time and space.

AB I used data from a 10-yr study of Eastern Kingbirds (Tyrannus tyrannus) breeding in three habitats in the Charlotte Valley of central New York to describe population trends, and to examine how population dynamics varied with habitat-specific estimates of reproductive output, adult dispersal, and survival. Although breeding date was slightly earlier on the floodplain than the upland. my other comparisons showed that clutch size, egg mass, or the number of young lost to starvation or predators did not vary with habitat. However, floodplain pairs had the lowest annual productivity because significantly more of their eggs were eaten by predators during incubation. Males tended to exhibit higher survival and site fidelity than females, but in both sexes, survival was highest on the floodplain and lowest in the upland. Most dispersing individuals of both sexes moved toward the creek (significant in males). As a result of this and the moderately high survival of adults that bred along the creek, the creek population remained stable between 1989 and 1998. whereas the floodplain. upland, and total population tended to decline (2.5%/yr). Counts of kingbirds from Breeding Bird Surveys (1989-1996) conducted within 100 km of the study site also showed significant declines. Population size within the Charlotte Valley was positively associated with local adult male survival and seasonal productivity, and the declines in population size seemed to be linked most strongly to a drop in male survival during the latter half of the study. Calculation of habitat specific population growth rates suggested that all three habitats, and thus the entire Charlotte Valley system, was a population sink whose numbers were supplemented substantially by outside immigration. However, productivity along the creek (and upland) was density dependent, suggesting also that the creek may function as a "pseudosink." My results suggest that spatial and temporal (i.e., successional) changes in habitat quality may have led to increased permanent emigration of adults, and declines in population size. The importance of outside immigration also suggests that population dynamics can only be understood by evaluating local trends within a larger geographic context.

AB We conducted an experimental study to assess the effects of habitat fragmentation on patch use by butterflies and skippers. Five fragmentation treatments (20%, 40%. 60%, 80%. and 100% habitat remaining) were replicated five times by selectively mowing 15 X 15 m patches of an old field. Community and species responses to fragmentation were tested against several alternative predictions: (1) the proportional area hypothesis, in which species richness or abundance declines linearly with habitat area, (2) the patch heterogeneity hypothesis, in which richness or abundance peaks at intermediate levels of fragmentation, (3) the critical threshold hypothesis, in which a nonlinear decrease in richness or abundance occurs below some critical level of habitat loss. and (4) the patch quality hypothesis, in which declines in richness or abundance with increasing habitat loss are partially offset by the resource value of the remnant habitat.
   We found that fragmentation treatment significantly affected species richness and total number of patch visits for the overall community, as well as the numbers of patch visits by individual species. Community and species responses were linearly related to the amount of habitat remaining, as predicted by the proportional area model of fragmentation. We also found that plots with a higher cover of flowering forbs received greater patch use. Thus, the effects of habitat quantity (patch area) and habitat quality (flower cover) were independent and additive, suggesting that moderately sized patches of high resource quality may be equivalent to large patches of lower quality. Therefore, to maintain local population densities of Lepidoptera, it may be possible to compensate for losses in habitat area with improvements: in habitat quality.
   Species did not uniformly respond to fragmentation. Rare species were disproportionately affected by fragmentation and did not occur in patches with < 40% habitat remaining. Several common species appeared unaffected by fragmentation: however, other common species were also significantly influenced by fragmentation treatment. These findings support the notion that rare species may be especially vulnerable to fragmentation, but it could be quite difficult to predict a priori how more common species will respond to habitat loss.

AB We examined the hypothesis that mutualists, predators, and host plant quality act in concert to determine the distribution and abundance of a common herbivore. The aphid, Chaitophorus populicola, is found only in association with ants, which provide tending services and protection from predators. As a consequence, aphid abundance declined by 88% on host plants located greater than or equal to6 m from an ant mound. Differences in host plant quality resulted in aphid fecundity being greatest on narrowleaf cottonwoods, 7-22% less on backcross hybrids, 37-46% less on F-1 hybrids, and 57-61% less on Fremont cottonwoods. Due to the combined effects of these factors, we found that the realized aphid habitat was only 21% of their potential habitat.
   On trees where aphids and tending ants are present, aphids and ants greatly outnumber any other arthropod species; therefore, we examined the hypothesis that the factors affecting aphid density and distribution are also determinants of arthropod community structure. On a per-tree basis, observational data showed that arthropod species richness was 51% greater and abundance was 67% greater on trees where aphid-ant mutualists were absent relative to trees where they were present. When aphids were experimentally removed and ants abandoned the tree, we found the same pattern. On a per-tree basis, arthropod species richness increased by 57%, and abundance increased by 80% where aphid-ant mutualists were removed, relative to control trees. Overall, a total of 90 arthropod species were examined in this study: 56% were found only on trees without aphid-ant mutualists, 12% were found only on trees with aphid-ant mutualists, and 32% were common to both. Specific guilds were also affected; the aphid-ant mutualism had a negative effect on herbivores, generalist predators, and other species of tending ants, and a positive effect on specialist enemies of aphids. These results suggest that, by examining the factors responsible for the population dynamics of a common herbivore, we may also uncover mechanisms that determine arthropod community structure. Furthermore, studies that address the role of mutualism in shaping communities are underrepresented in the literature; these results emphasize the importance of mutualism in ecological communities.

AB Despite many observations of herbivores and granivores influencing the survival of tree seeds and seedlings, the net effects of these consumers on plant succession remain unclear. We used both experimental herbivore manipulations and observations of changes in vegetation cover to evaluate the longer-term impacts of small-mammal herbivores and granivores on woody plant invasion into old fields in New York State. Over a 5-yr period, we manipulated the density of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) within partial enclosures replicated at five study sites. Average vole activity in enclosures with high vole density was significantly greater than that in enclosures with low vole density. In contrast, activity of competitively inferior white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) was significantly greater within enclosures designated as low vole density. Colonization by tree seedlings, as well as shrubs and vines. was significantly greater in enclosures under the low vole density treatment. Further, tree seedling abundance was higher in shrub-dominated enclosures with low vole, but high mouse, activity. Five years of contrasting mouse and vole activity within adjacent enclosures revealed that seedling predation by voles had a greater net effect on changes in woody vegetation cover in old fields than did seed predation by mice, despite studies reporting higher rates of seed vs. seedling predation in these areas. We conclude that short-term measures of predation intensity may not accurately predict the longer-term effects of small-mammal herbivores on vegetation dynamics and suggest that voles may be a keystone herbivore in old-field succession.

AB The regional dynamics of pond-breeding amphibians are often discussed in the context of metapopulations, under the assumption that individual ponds support distinct subpopulations. We used a combination of indirect and direct methods to assess the spatial population structure of California tiger salamanders (Ambystoma californiense) relative to two basic requirements of metapopulation models: (1) that patches support somewhat independent populations linked by dispersal, and (2) that interpatch dispersal probabilities decline as distance increases. Over three consecutive field seasons we captured, marked, and released adult California tiger salamanders at 10 breeding ponds. We observed interpond dispersal by these experienced breeders, and also by first-time breeders marked as newly metamorphosed juveniles at one pond. Spatial autocorrelation of pond-specific demographic parameters suggests that these ponds meet both of these requirements of metapopulation theory. Direct observations of interpond movement by marked individuals support the conclusions of the autocorrelation analyses but reveal relatively high probabilities of interpond movement by both first-time and experienced breeders. We conclude that the subpopulations utilizing these ponds are too closely linked by dispersal for classical extinction-colonization metapopulation dynamics to apply. High probabilities of dispersal are predicted to constantly supply less isolated ponds in this system with dispersers such that local extinctions will be rare. Based on population genetic theory, the high probability of interpond movement is also predicted to prevent significant genetic divergence among ponds over large areas.

AB We studied dispersal movements in 12 enclosed, patchy populations of root voles (Microtus occonomus) during the breeding season. The habitat was manipulated experimentally so that there were four replicates of three types of habitat patch configuration: two large patches, six small isolated patches, and six small patches of which two patch triplets were connected by corridors. The total habitat area (1350 m(2)) and the distance to nearest neighboring patch (15 m) were the same in the three different configurations. The matrix area between the patches was kept open and uninhabitable for voles by weekly mowing. Dispersal was defined as shifts between patches. Movements across the open matrix habitat to traps located along the edge of the enclosures were also recorded.
   The frequency of shifts between patches was higher among small than among large patches. Corridors channeled dispersal between corridor-connected patches but did not enhance the frequency of shifts between patches at the population level. Dispersal was strongly density dependent, and most so for subadult animals. High-density patches had low emigration rates. Root voles immigrated onto patches with a smaller number of individuals, especially of their own sex and reproductive state, than were present in the patch they left. Thus most shifts between patches took place from patches with relatively low density to patches with even lower density. Small patches had higher spatiotemporal variability in density and demographic composition than large patches, and this probably caused the higher dispersal rate among small patches. Emigration and immigration contributed most to the demographic turnover in small patches. In particular, emigration was the main demographic parameter behind declining numbers and patch extinction in small patches with few individuals.
   Our study highlights the importance of taking patch-specific conditions such as patch size, demographic composition, and spatiotemporal demographic variability into account when studying dispersal rates. Moreover, the kind of density-dependent emigration-immigration dynamics found in our study does not match the common perception that dispersal works primarily to reduce extinction probabilities through rescue effects. In particular, the impact of emigration as a factor that may increase the extinction probability of small, isolated patches with few individuals needs to be considered in future studies.

AB We discovered that newly settled marine rock crabs, Cancer irroratus, exhibit a variety of non-adult colors early in life. This color polymorphism predominates in populations of minute juvenile crabs living in polychromatic habitats where it apparently renders them inconspicuous to visual predators such as fish. Experiments revealed lower frequencies of non-adult color morphs in monochromatic three-dimensional habitats with predators and polychromatic habitats from which predators were excluded. These patterns result from selective predation on visually contrasting color morphs. Adult crabs are monochromatic, conspicuous, and not associated with shelters. Both polymorphic newly settled and monochromatic large individuals occur in environments dominated by small predatory fish where larger adult crabs are at low risk of predation. Behavioral and visual crypsis may only be important early in life when post-settlement mortality is high, and survival at that stage determines recruitment and ultimately population densities. The well-known examples of camouflage among insects usually apply to adults who, unlike these marine counterparts, are small relative to their predators and thus remain vulnerable throughout their lives. Many other large marine crustaceans are cryptic only early in life, suggesting that this early developmental color polymorphism might be an important difference between marine and terrestrial arthropods.

AB A synthesis of community and ecosystem ecology should yield insights into the role of species in ecosystem function. Concepts from these subdisciplines of ecology, specifically species compensation and ecosystem homeostasis. can be linked by analyzing the effect of changes in the abundance of species on ecosystem processes. Compensatory changes in species populations in response to environmental fluctuations can maintain an approximate steady state between rates of resource supply and resource consumption. We predict that ecosystem-level properties, such as species richness, total population. biomass, and energy use, will exhibit less variability in response to environmental change than will species composition. We tested this prediction using long-term data of a desert rodent community responding to natural environmental fluctuations and of a plant community responding to experimental manipulations. For the rodents, species composition was twice as variable as the ecosystem properties. This result was the same for both the analysis of variability around the 22-yr average and the analysis of variability from one time period to the next. For the plant communities, species composition was more variable among treatments in most years than stem count or species richness. Using the variance ratio proposed by J. L. Klug et al. we detected negative covariances in the rodent community, confirming the presence of compensatory dynamics.

AB Two coexisting species of spiny mice in rocky deserts in Israel temporally partition activity in opposite parts of the diel cycle. Acomys cahirinus is nocturnal and A. russatus is diurnal. although it becomes nocturnal if its congener is experimentally removed, suggesting that the temporal partitioning is driven by interspecific competition. Such extreme temporal partitioning within the diel cycle has not previously been recorded elsewhere among mammals. Using artificial food patches. we studied microhabitat use and foraging efficiencies under seasonally variable predator regimes and physiological pressures to assess the roles that habitat structure and foraging behavior might play in coexistence. The two species showed trade-offs in foraging efficiency leading to different strategies of microhabitat use that may help promote coexistence. A. cahirinus is a "cream skimmer," a relatively inefficient forager that gives up at relatively high giving-up densities, and a habitat generalist: whereas A. russatus is a habitat specialist, perhaps compensating for this restricted niche by foraging very efficiently to low giving-up densities. Seasonal shifts in foraging microhabitat suggest that the response to predation risk from snakes in summer overrides and opposes the effects of physiological costs and risk from owls and diurnal raptors, leading to increased predatory risk and foraging microhabitat overlap in summer. Temporal partitioning of the food resource may compensate for decreased partitioning of the habitat resource in summer. Provision of cover was more important than escape distance in determining habitat and microhabitat use. Boulder fields in rocky deserts provide a physical structure that is more complex and provides more continuous cover than is available in open deserts, where most research on community structure of desert rodents has been carried out. We propose that this physical structure of rocky deserts, in conjunction with the desert adaptations of A. russatus, may enable the extreme temporal partitioning to opposite parts of the diel cycle and, therefore, contributes to coexistence in this community.

AB The manner and extent to which physiological alterations resulting from folivory can affect the growth, survival, and resistance of trees against subsequent insects and fungi is poorly understood. Information obtained under natural conditions and with subcortically feeding insects is particularly lacking. We evaluated the effects of varying levels of natural feeding by a folivore on subsequent host growth, survival, and suitability to subcortical insects and fungi and also considered implications as to how source limitations caused by defoliation relate to current plant defense theories. The study system consisted of Choristoneura pinus pinus, the jack pine budworm, on Pinus banksiana Lamb., jack pine. We quantified a range of defoliation by C. pinus pinus in test trees and measured parameters of host defenses and colonization by bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) and woodborers (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae). We also measured colonization and accompanying tree mortality attributable to these insects. Tree physiological parameters and insect colonization patterns were measured over a 24-mo period. Primary resin flow rates and the ability of active responses to confine the bark beetle's fungal symbiont Ophiostoma ips within the phloem, were reduced by high levels of defoliation. These patterns were further influenced by host seasonal phenology and time since defoliation. The predominant subcortical insects responding to defoliation by C. pinus pinus were Ips grandicollis and Monochamus carolinensis. Colonization by these insects together increased exponentially in relation to defoliation level, but the two species differentially exploited trees from particular defoliation levels. The loss of growth among surviving trees increased with defoliation intensity. However, growth and defensive capacity were not related, either negatively or positively, during any interval of this study. Depending on the length of time since defoliation stress, the relationship between plant defense and defoliation intensity uas either parabolic, as predicted by growth differentiation theory, or inverse linear, as predicted by plant stress theory. Thus, differing models depicting how carbon allocation and overall carbon availability can influence secondary-chemical metabolism in plants may represent various stages along a temporal continuum. Our results suggest that the time since a stress is exerted is an important variant that should be incorporated into synthetic theories of plant defense. These results also suggest that integrative models of plant defense theory can be extended to describe impacts on community-level interactions.

AB Classifications of tree species into regeneration guilds or functional groups are often based on a limited number of life history characteristics indicative of requirements for early establishment, with the assumption that these traits are correlated with growth requirements of larger individuals. We tested the validity of this assumption for Alseis blackiana, a common canopy tree in central Panama, by examining its seed germination, seedling growth, and sapling distribution, growth, and mortality. We found that the early life history of Alseis is characteristic of pioneer species: the seed germination rate was much higher in forest gaps than in the forest understory, small seedlings were absent from the understory, and seedlings showed strong plastic responses to variation in light. Seedling relative growth rate, leaf area production rate, and maximum carbon assimilation rates of Alseis are much more similar to those of the pioneer tree Miconia argentea than to those of the non-pioneer tree Tetragastris panamensis. However, in contrast to Miconia, established seedlings of Alseis are capable of remarkable persistence in the understory; in a 1-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island, the mortality rate for 722 saplings <1 cm dbh was <4% per year between 1986 and 1998. We suspect that shade tolerance in Alseis is achieved by both physiological and morphological adaptations, e.g., efficient light interception by thin, nonoverlapping leaves, tolerance to litterfall damage, and a high resprouting capacity. These results show that existing functional group classifications do not account for the full range of seedling trait combinations found in tropical trees and indicate that a gap requirement for seedling establishment need not limit the abundance of adult individuals in a stand.

AB Loss of eelgrass (Zostera marina) habitat from temperate estuaries worldwide often coincides with increased macroalgal accumulations resulting from increased delivery of anthropogenic nitrogen. We conducted macroalgal enclosure/exclosure experiments during summer 1998 within eelgrass populations in two estuaries of Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts, USA, to evaluate how increased macroalgal biomass affects density, recruitment, growth rate, and production of eelgrass. One estuary featured a low nitrogen loading rate and sustained a relatively pristine eelgrass population with a 2 cm high macroalgal canopy. The other estuary had a sixfold higher nitrogen loading rate and a declining eelgrass population with a 9 cm high macroalgal canopy. Experimental units were 1 X 1 m plots of eelgrass fenced within 50 cm high plastic mesh that excluded or included macroalgae at canopy heights ranging from 0 to 25 cm. In both estuaries, rates of eelgrass loss increased, largely a result of decreased recruitment, and growth rates decreased (due to decreased rates of leaf appearance) with increasing macroalgal canopy height. Aboveground summer production in both estuaries decreased exponentially as macroalgal canopy heights increased. We conclude that macroalgal cover is a proximate cause for loss of eelgrass in the higher N estuary since, upon removal of macroalgae, we observed an increase in shoot density, a 55% increase in summer growth, and a 500% increase in summer aboveground net production. Based on summer growth data and density of shoots in our experimental plots the following spring, we suggest that the negative impacts of macroalgal canopies persist, but also that eelgrass recovery upon removal of macroalgae may be possible.
   To identify the mechanisms by which macroalgae potentially inhibit eelgrass production, we measured changes in nutrient and oxygen concentrations resulting from macroalgal canopies and estimated the relative importance of summer standing stocks of phytoplankton, epiphytes, and macroalgae to potential shading of eelgrass in both estuaries. We document both (1) unfavorable biogeochemical conditions (lowered redox conditions and potentially toxic concentrations of NH4+) imposed by the presence of macroalgal canopies and (2) potential light limitation of eelgrass by standing stocks of producers in the higher N estuary, with estimates of light reduction via macroalgae numerically more important than light sequestration by phytoplankton and epiphytes for newly recruiting shoots. Increased macroalgal biomass associated with increased nitrogen loading to estuaries can lead to eelgrass disappearance, and we identify an approximate 9-12-cm critical macroalgal canopy height at which eelgrass declines.

AB In insect host-parasitoid systems, successful immune responses of the host kill the parasitoid, and successful development of the parasitoid will kill the host. Thus, hosts and their parasitoids can exert strong selection on each other that may lead to the coevolution of host defense traits and parasitoid counter-defenses. In upstate New York, pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) specialized on alfalfa are, on average, two times more physiologically resistant to parasitism by Aphidius ervi parasitoids than pea aphids specialized on clover There is genetic Variation within populations of Aphidius ervi in the ability to overcome pea aphid resistance; thus an evolutionary response to the differences in aphid resistance is possible. Here, I document that pea aphid populations that are more resistant to parasitism in laboratory assays exhibit lower rates of parasitism in the field, suggesting that the genetically based differences in aphid resistance may influence rates of successful parasitism. I found that the difference in resistance between pea aphids specialized on alfalfa or on clover in New York is present in additional populations of pea aphids assayed over several years and is present in Maryland as well as New York. However, despite the potentially large difference in selective regimes due to differences in aphid resistance, parasitoids collected from alfalfa fields and clover fields do not differ in their ability to overcome pea aphid resistance. There is no evidence that they are adapted to aphids from their home crop, or locally adapted to aphids from their home field. The mobility of this parasitoid, and its relatively recent introduction to North America as a biological control agent, may contribute to the lack of adaptation.

AB Detection of density dependence in animal populations is a primary goal of population ecology, and the processes causing density dependence play a major role in population regulation. Predation can strongly regulate populations by populational and behavioral responses of predators to their prey. Here I evaluate the existence and strength of density-dependent mortality in local populations of a reef fsh, the kelp perch (Brachyistius frenatus), caused by its predator, the kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus). Specifically, I examine both the functional response and a potential aggregative response by kelp bass as mechanisms underlying predator-induced density-dependent mortality.
   I calculated the per capita mortality of kelp perch as a result of the functional response of its predator by subjecting a range of densities of kelp perch to a low, constant number of kelp bass and different amounts of giant kelp (Macrocystis,pyrifera) as habitat structure and a potential prey refuge. The potential for an aggregative response by kelp bass was determined by exposing densities of kelp perch to natural levels of kelp bass in the field. Per capita mortality of kelp perch in the laboratory was inversely density dependent to density independent with increasing habitat structure. By contrast, per capita mortality in the field was strongly density dependent, with evidence for an aggregative response by kelp bass. Furthermore, emigration and other nonpredatory losses of kelp perch from field plots were negligible, indicating that the product of the functional and aggregative responses by kelp bass induced density-dependent mortality in kelp perch. My results indicated that increasing habitat structural complexity at low densities of kelp perch, coupled with a strong aggregative response by kelp bass, was responsible for the observed pattern of density-dependent mortality. In addition, the distribution and relative abundances of kelp perch and kelp bass at larger spatial scales (entire reefs) were consistent with predation as an important process structuring local populations of kelp perch. The contrasting patterns of short-term per capita mortality found here underscore the need to evaluate both the functional and aggregative responses of predators to their prey. Ultimately, the pattern of mortality expressed will be determined by the relative strengths of these behavioral responses and the degree to which habitat structure provides an effective prey refuge.

AB The level of tree diversity varies greatly between sites in Guyana and decreases along a gradient from south to north. We conducted a study to understand what controls this gradient of diversity using data from country-wide forest inventories. Analysis of tree diversity on the basis of soil and rainfall effects in an area of 15 x 10(6) ha showed that soil exerts a strong local effect on tree diversity, whereas rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, and length of the dry season do not.
   Community averages of disturbance-sensitive attributes of trees, such as seed mass or wood density, were not correlated with variation in either rainfall or soil, but were strongly correlated with tree diversity. As such, the forests in central Guyana were characterized by generally a high average wood density, large seeds, and rodent or unassisted dispersal. These forests also displayed the highest single dominance, thus lowest diversity and low percentages of pioneers in the community. The more highly diverse forests in south Guyana showed much lower average community wood density and seed mass, and bird and primate dispersal were more common than in central Guyana.
   Large-scale spatial variation in diversity and community averages of life history characteristics are here considered the product of local convergence of species with similar characteristics. Characteristics bestowing competitive superiority in environments with little disturbance ultimately lead to a decline in diversity through competitive exclusion, much as that predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and dynamic equilibrium theory. The more diverse communities are associated with characteristics of superior colonizers: low wood density, small seeds, and good dispersal. Variation in diversity at smaller spatial scales is strongly affected by soils.

AB Habitat selection is often viewed as a major process determining the distribution and abundance of animals. If animals have limited control over their dispersal, however, they may sometimes be unable to colonize preferred habitats. In such cases, observed spatial variations in abundance may reflect the vagaries of colonization rather than true habitat preferences. Our study examined whether local variations in the density of stream insects are related to habitat quality or colonization history. We focused on larval black flies (Simulium vittatum), a representative group of suspension feeders that exhibit strong preferences for habitats characterized by high near-bed velocities. Despite these preferences, variations in the density of S. vittatum larvae across benthic substrates within the riffles of a Pennsylvania stream were often weakly related to velocity. Moreover, densities on substrates of similar velocity varied by more than six-fold. We conducted a field experiment to test whether these density differences reflect habitat preferences and employed a short-term behavioral assay based on larval emigration to quantify preference. We used a block design to compare emigration rates from paired substrates that had been colonized by markedly different larval densities despite their similar velocities. After removing these larvae, we added larvae to both substrate types in equal numbers, following which we measured larval emigration. There was no significant difference in emigration between these paired substrates even though statistical power was high, which indicates that the large density differences present at the end of the colonization period on substrates of similar velocity were unrelated to habitat preferences. There were, however, significantly more departures from blocks of substrates in lower velocities than from those in higher velocities, demonstrating that the duration of our experiment was sufficient for black fly larvae to express their habitat preferences. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that dispersal constraints associated with the settlement of drifting larvae limit their ability to reach preferred habitats. In fact, related studies predict that larval settlement rates are lowest in the high velocity habitats preferred by larvae. We conclude that such dispersal constraints may be important for a wide variety of freshwater, marine, and terrestrial organisms that are transported by moving fluids.

AB Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) seeds are dispersed by Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana), a bird that makes caches under 2-3 cm of soil. Cached seeds may delay germination for one or more years in part because of underdeveloped embryos at the time of seed dispersal. Consequently, whitebark pine may show a soil seed bank strategy that is unique among pines (Pinaceae, Pinus). From 1990 to 1995 we studied natural whitebark pine regeneration following the 1988 Yellowstone fires to determine: (1) whether whitebark pine typically exhibits delayed seed germination and, if so, (2) how this affects patterns of regeneration over time, and (3) whether germination is the result of seed maturation or is stimulated by high levels of moisture availability. We established 275 permanent plots, each 20 m(2) in area, divided between Henderson Mountain, Gallatin National Forest, Montana, and Mt. Washburn, Yellowstone National Park. In the, Henderson Mountain study area, the ecological conditions or "treatments" included: dry, burned; moist, burned; dry, unburned; and moist, unburned. In the Mt. Washburn study area, the ecological treatments were dry, burned; moist, burned; and moist, moderately burned. Synchronous delayed seed germination occurred throughout both study areas. The greatest densities of new seedlings appeared in the summers of 1991 and 1993, but the greatest cone crops were produced in 1989 and 1991, Most germination followed two winters of seed dormancy. Regeneration densities were consistently highest on the Mt. Washburn moist treatments. High correlation between weighted means for new regeneration and March-plus-April precipitation, as well as the results of residual and multiple regression analyses, suggests that cone production two years prior and March-plus-April precipitation together account for the regeneration patterns in the Mt. Washburn study area. The role of precipitation requires further study. Delayed seed germination, producing a soil seed bank, may be an ecological strategy in whitebark pine that is the product of selection. Although underdeveloped embryos may be a consequence of both a short growing season and premature seed dispersal by nutcrackers, seed caching may further select for slow embryo maturation, as well as moisture-resistant seed coats to reduce nonadaptive germination.

   RESPONSES
AB Optimal values for life history traits are expected to depend upon. environmental conditions during development and the period within which development is constrained (e.g., biotic factors and time constraints, respectively). Theory predicts that life history responses to both biotic factors and time constraints may be both direct and behaviorally mediated. Few experimental studies of life histories have considered the joint effects of biotic factors and time constraints, and fewer still have been able to disentangle direct from behaviorally mediated effects. We studied such interactions by manipulating the perceived time to the onset of winter, predation risk. and food resources level in larvae of the damselfly Lestes sponsa. In the first experiment (predation x time constraint), the presence of a predator caused an overall reduction in foraging activity, development rate, and mass at emergence. However. larvae that had less time available before the end of the season, increased foraging activity and development rate, while mass at emergence decreased. These results suggest that the observed changes in life history characters were behaviorally mediated in the presence of predators. In contrast, life history responses of time-constrained larvae occurred independently of the behavioral changes and, therefore, were direct. In the second experiment (food level x time constraint) larvae under high food levels had a higher foraging activity, increased development rate, and higher growth rates, compared to low food-level treatments, Time-cons trained larvae accelerated development and had a smaller mass at emergence at high food levels than larvae that were not time constrained. In contrast, and opposite to predictions, time-constrained larvae at low food levels had the slowest development rate and the largest mass at emergence. We suggest that larvae in the latter group were aiming to delay emergence to the next season (cohort splitting). Our results suggest that both behaviorally mediated and direct responses to biotic factors and time constraints are a feature of the life history of this damselfly.

AB We investigated the influence of trophic status on the lipid content and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in planktonic food webs from 19 lakes in southern Sweden. The lipid content in phytoplankton (10-45 mum), microzooplankton (45-150 mum) and large macrozooplankton (>500 mum) was negatively related to the total phosphorus (Tot-P) concentration in lakes. The lipid content in macrozooplankton (>150 Gem) and young-of-the-year roach (Rutilus rutilus) was not related to Tot-P in lakes. On a dry mass basis (ng/g dry mass), the sum of PCB concentrations in phytoplankton and microzooplankton was negatively related to Tot-P in lakes. Thus, the PCB concentrations in phytoplankton and microzooplankton were explained by the decreasing lipid content of these fractions with increasing trophic status of lakes; and when normalized to lipid content (ng/g extractable lipid) we found no differences in PCB concentrations among lakes. We conclude that the lipid content of phytoplankton increased with increased nutrient stress, explaining the negative relationship between lake trophy and phytoplankton organochlorine (OC) concentrations on a dry mass basis. The relationship found between lipids and lake trophy in producers was not transferred in the food chain.

AB We observed substantial variation in seasonal growth rates, autumn body size, and growing-season mortality among eight experimental cohorts of age-0 rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Wet mass, water, lipids (storage), and lipid-free dry mass (structure) had biphasic allometries with inflexions at similar to 10 cm in length. Dry:wet mass and storage:structure ratios were positively related to fish length, indicating that the relative quantities of these constituents change with body size. Lipid concentration varied according to a sigmoid relationship with wet mass which also had a growth-rate dependence. Independent assessments of the allometry of growing-season survival and winter metabolism facilitated assessment of the costs and benefits of two alternate energy allocation strategies of young fish. For cohorts with low growth rates and small autumn body size, a somatic growth rate maximization strategy is optimum, producing a 5% net survival advantage over an energy storage maximization strategy. For cohorts with intermediate growth rates and autumn mass, somatic growth and energy storage strategies lead to similar first-year survival. The fastest growing cohorts are estimated to have a net survival advantage of 7%, by adopting an energy storage maximization strategy over a growth rate maximization strategy.

AB Although bacteria are often treated as one entity in ecological studies, bacterial assemblages are composed of individual species populations. Bacterial assemblages can have their own richness and structure, analogous to communities of plants and animals, although few studies have attempted to describe spatial or temporal patterns in their structure. In this study, we examined successional changes in the structure of bacterial assemblages using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplified 16S rDNA fragments. Bacterial biofilm assemblages developing on glass slides in a mesocosm and a small lake showed an initial increase in richness over the first week, followed by a slight decrease and a subsequent increase after two to three months. Functional changes in the bacterial community were examined using most probable number estimates and revealed decreases in the abundance of glucose- and cellulose-degraders during biofilm development, whereas benzoate-degraders became more abundant in the lake biofilms. The banding patterns observed on DGGE gels were used to derive rank-abundance profiles for each stage of biofilm development. These pro-tiles resembled those observed for communities of macroorganisms and could usually be described by geometric series models. These models suggested greater equitability in bacterial community structure as the biofilms developed. A comparison of two successional series of biofilms separated by 30 d revealed that neither successional stage nor time of sampling was the major factor influencing bacterial assemblage structure. Our results allowed us to suggest a general model for the development of bacterial biofilm assemblages that emphasizes the interaction of species and resource diversity. This model suggests that, at least in biofilms, bacterial assemblages may not be structured by the resource competition or niche-driven patterns typical of communities of macroorganisms.

AB Understanding and predicting the effects of species extinction and other environmental impacts in natural ecosystems is difficult because of their inherent complexity. Successful prediction in complex systems requires empirically accessible theoretical frameworks to limit the range of possible outcomes. I explored the predictions of multispecies Markov models, based on transition probabilities derived from repeated censuses of fixed points in the middle intertidal community of Tatoosh Island, Washington, USA, under natural conditions and after altering the model to reflect species extinction and changes in size-structured processes. The unmanipulated model predicted a mussel-dominated community and quantitatively captured 98.7% of the variation in community composition in independent transects. Although model assumptions that transition probabilities did not vary over time and depended only on the state of a point at the previous census were violated, altering the model to account for these violations provided no improvement in model performance. The manipulated models indicated that most species and transitions had relatively weak effects on community composition, the strongest effects being associated with California mussels (Mytilus californianus), articulated coralline algae (Corallina vancouveriensis), and predatory birds. The manipulated models also predicted that extinction of several species, particularly predatory birds, affects the resilience of the system, as assessed by return time. The effects of species on composition and resilience were poorly correlated, suggesting that assessing the importance of species depends on the type of ecosystem response being considered. The model successfully predicted quantitative shifts in community composition and ecosystem dynamics under several novel conditions: on vertical walls where bird predation and adult mussel recruitment are absent, and in previously published experiments that excluded birds from horizontal benches. These results suggest that Markov models can provide a useful predictive framework for some types of environmental impacts on complex ecosystems.

This analogy is difficult to reconcile with our current understanding of ecological systems as metastable adaptive systems that may operate far from equilibrium. This paper discusses some logical and scientific problems associated with the ecosystem concept, and suggests a number of modifications in the paradigm to address these problems.

AB We analyze a model of life history evolution in which there is a temporally variable cost of reproduction. Analysis of the stochastic growth rate indicates that the optimal clutch size in a variable environment can be substantially increased or decreased relative to the optimal clutch size in a constant environment. This finding holds regardless of whether the cost of reproduction varies discretely or continuously. Our results also illustrate how two distinct optimal life histories can evolve in response to a given amount of environmental variability. One life history pays a cost of reproduction that is relatively fixed and small on average (by producing a small fixed clutch size); it can always produce an optimal clutch size but is unable to exploit highly favorable environments. The other pays a cost of reproduction that is variable and large on average (by producing a large fixed clutch size); it cannot always produce an optimal clutch size but is able to exploit highly favorable environments.

AB Predator-prey and other nonlinear ecological interactions often lead to oscillatory dynamics in temporal systems and in spatial systems when the rates of movement are large, so that individuals are effectively well mixed and space becomes unimportant. When individuals are not well mixed, however. properties of fluctuations in population densities, and in particular their amplitudes. are known to vary with the spatial scale at which the system is observed. We investigate the relationship among dynamics at different spatial scales with an individual-based predator-prey model that is stochastic and nonlinear. Results elucidate the role of spatial pattern and individual variability in the dynamics of densities. We show that spatial patterns in this system reduce the per capita rates of predation and prey growth but preserve functional forms. The functional forms remain those one would expect in a well-mixed system in which individuals interact according to mean population densities, but with modified parameters. This similarity of the functional forms allows us to approximate accurately the long-term dynamics of the spatial system at large scales with a temporal predator-prey model with only two variables, a simple system of ordinary differential equations of the type ecologists have been using for a long time. This approximation provides an explanation for the stabilizing role of space. the decrease in the amplitude of fluctuations from the well-mixed to the limited-movement case.
   We also provide an explanation for the previously described aperiodic dynamics of densities at intermediate spatial scales. These irregular cycles result from the interplay of demographic noise with decaying oscillations, where the decay of the cycles is due to the spatial patterns. It is indeed possible to capture essential properties of these cycles. including their apparent sensitivity to initial conditions, with a model that follows individuals but parameterizes their spatial interactions in a simple way, using again the similarity of functional forms and the modified parameters. Thus, demographic noise appears essential at a spatial scale previously chosen for the high degree of determinism in the dynamics.
   Our results illustrate a semi-empirical approach to simplify and to scale spatial ecological systems that are oscillatory from individual or local-scale to large-scale dynamics.

AB Multispecies metapopulation models generally make the assumption that the interacting species occupy the same habitat network as one another. We examined the spatial distribution, metapopulation structure, and habitat network of four lepidopteran herbivores feeding on a single host plant, Lotus corniculatus, in a patchy landscape in North Wales, UK. The four species showed contrasting spatial distributions despite the fact that they feed on the same host plant. Information on dispersal rates and population turnover suggest that each species is likely to exhibit metapopulation dynamics, but with different relative contributions of local and regional processes. Detailed analyses of habitat requirements suggest that habitat networks were species-specific, and their degree of occupancy a function of the number of patches in the system. These results do not support the idea that patchiness promotes regional coexistence through multispecies metapopulation dynamics. Rather, each species appeared to act as a largely independent metapopulation system in its own specific habitat network. The results also suggest that conservation recommendations must be based on detailed analysis of the requirements of each key species in order to understand their spatial dynamics.

AB Episodic outbreaks of pandora moth (Coloradia pandora Blake), a forest insect that defoliates ponderosa pine (Pinus panderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) and other pine species in the western United States, have recurred several times during the 20th century in forests of south-central Oregon. We collected and analyzed tree-ring samples from stands affected by recent outbreaks of pandora moth to develop a long-term record of outbreaks. Outbreaks were evident in tree-ring series as a characteristic "signature" of sharply reduced latewood width within a ring, followed by reduced ring widths lasting 4-20 yr. We verified that this tree-ring signature was unrelated to drought or other climatic fluctuations by comparing the timing of known and inferred outbreaks with independent climatic data. Using the pandora moth tree-ring signature, we reconstructed a 622-year record of 22 individual outbreaks in 14 old-growth ponderosa pine stands. This is currently the longest regional reconstruction of forest insect outbreak history in North America. Intervals between pandora moth outbreaks were highly variable within individual forest stands, ranging from 9 yr to 156 yr. Spectral analyses of a composite time series from all stands, however, showed more consistent intervals between outbreaks, suggesting quasicyclical population dynamics at regional and decadal scales. Waveforms extracted from the regional outbreak time series had periods ranging over similar to 18-24 yr (39.7% variance explained) and similar to 37-41 yr (37.3% variance explained). The periods and strengths of these cycles varied across the centuries, with the largest outbreaks occurring when relatively high-amplitude periods of the dominant cycles were in phase. Twentieth-century outbreaks were not more synchronous (extensive), severe, or longer in duration than outbreaks in previous centuries, but there was an unusual 60-yr reduction in regional activity during similar to 1920-1980. The changing dynamical behavior of pandora moth populations highlights the need to evaluate historical factors that may have influenced this system, such as climatic variations, forest fires, and human land uses. Although cyclical dynamics in animal populations have most commonly been attributed to endogenous, ecological processes (e.g., "delayed density dependence," predators, pathogens, and parasites) our findings suggest that exogenous processes (e.g., climatic oscillations) may also be involved.
