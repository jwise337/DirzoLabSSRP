AB Ratio-dependent and prey-dependent models of trophic interactions make very different predictions about the steady-state (equilibrial) properties of ecosystems, such as the response of equilibrium abundance and biomass of organisms in each trophic level to increased primary productivity or nutrient input. Prey-dependent theory predicts alternating positive, negative, and zero responses of trophic levels to increased productivity, whereas ratio-dependent theory predicts proportional increase in all trophic level biomasses. We analyzed data on the nutrient input and the biomasses of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish across lakes to distinguish between ratio-dependent and prey-dependent models. The results show parallel increases in all trophic levels as a result of increased nutrient input, demonstrating that natural systems are closer to ratio dependence than to prey dependence.

AB Meta-analysis is a method ecologists may find useful for quantitatively reviewing and systematically examining results from a large number of studies on a subject for which there is conflicting evidence. I used meta-analysis to integrate results from 42 independent brood-enlargement studies and tested Lack's hypothesis that clutch size in birds has evolved toward that which produces the most surviving offspring. Cumulative evidence did not support Lack's hypothesis. Significantly (two-tailed P = .016) more fledglings were produced in enlarged broods than in normal-sized broods, indicating parents could raise more young than they had eggs. The standardized treatment effect of brood enlargement across all studies was a mean (+/-1 SE) increase of 0.55 (+/-0.22) standard deviations in the number of young produced. This result does not appear to bc affected by a publishing bias and is unlikely to be reversed by inclusion of additional studies. I also examined differences in methodology and species studied as possible confounding factors and explanations for conflicting results. Longer studies and species with altricial young were more likely to show food limitation. Latitude and date of study, degree of brood enlargement, validity of a study, and annual adult survival did not affect results.

AB To examine how selection may act on seed dispersal, we experimentally manipulated seed distributions and compared levels and patterns of seedling recruitment in three altered distributions, relative to the nonmanipulated, leptokurtic distribution.  We picked up, then redistributed the wind-dispersed seeds of two isolated parents of Tachigalia versicolor, a tropical tree species growing on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama.  Three experimental distributions were created in long columns adjacent to or well beyond the undisturbed column of the natural distribution:  (1) a nonleptokurtic "even" distribution of uniform density equal to the mean density throughout the natural column, (2) a "mixed" distribution with the same total number and kurtosis as the natural column, but composed of an equal proportion of seeds from the two parent trees, and (3) an "extended-tail" distribution spread in low uniform density up to 1.8 km beyond the natural distribution.  Thus, the study addressed the relative importance of density, distance, and genetic makeup on offspring recruitment.
   The results of the 2 yr observations of seed and seedling survival indicate that, relative to the natural distribution, seedling recruitment at 2 yr was greater in the even distribution, was minimally affected by a mixture of genotypes from overlapping distributions of two parent trees, and was very infrequent from seeds dispersed to a wide variety of distant sites.  Although the mixture of genotypes from overlapping distributions did enhance the probability of survival at one site, that effect occurred only during the seedling and not the seed stage.  For the extended-tail and mixed distributions, in which offspring of both parents occurred at both sites, the impact of site differences (survival in Site A tail > Site B tail; survival in Site A mixed > Site B mixed) exceeded that of parent differences (Parent A > Parent B).
   The major differences among distributions arose in the seed and early seedling stages (< 2 mo), and were due to heavy mortality primarily from seed predators (postdispersal by terrestrial mammals) and mammalian herbivores eating young seedlings.  Mammalian predation and herbivory were particularly heavy in the extended-tail distributions.  It appeared that either predator satiation and/or incomplete searching occurred in the three, much more dense distributions adjacent to the parent trees.  In contrast, density-dependent mortality at the spatial scale of 1-m2 experimental quadrats was limited to very high densities and occurred only in early seedling stages (0-2 mo).  Distance effects on the probability of survival were inconsistent both between sites and among distributions.  However, the absolute number of seedlings surviving at 2 yr declined with distance from the parent in all three distributions, except the even distribution at Tree A.  Additionally, seedling recruitment at any distance < 100 m from the parent for all three distributions greatly exceeded recruitment at extended-tail (100-1800 m) sites.
   In summary, offspring recruitment was enhanced by the high cohort density at a large spatial scale (i.e., within a circle of 100 m radius) because of predator satiation.  At the same time, it was enhanced slightly by the evenness of the distribution within this scale because of density-dependent mortality at a smaller spatial scale (i.e., 1 m2).  Therefore, we conclude that selection on dispersal by Tachigalia versicolor on BCI should act to increase the uniformity of the seed distribution, but not to increase dispersal distance to the point that the density of the seed shadow is diluted.

AB The selection on residual mass (relative to body size) at fledging was investigated in the Collared Flycatcher Ficedula albicollis and the Great Tit Parus major. Directional selection for high fledging mass was evident in 6 of 7 yr in Collared Flycatchers but only in 1 of 5 yr in Great Tits. Three different methods of demonstrating and testing stabilizing selection are compared. Stabilizing selection on relative mass occurred in both species, but the frequency with which this was established depended on which method was used. None of the methods seemed to be universally reliable, and the problem of defining and testing stabilizing selection is discussed. In Collared Flycatchers mass seemed to be most important for juvenile survival. Also in Great Tits mass was important, but in addition other traits (e.g., hatching date) strongly influenced juvenile survival in this species. This possible difference between the two species is suggested to relate to differences in their territory establishment.

AB We used experimental and multiple-regression approaches to test the hypothesis that the availability of direct light (sunflecks) is important for the growth and reproduction of Adenocaulon bicolor, a perennial herb occurring in the understory of a coastal redwood forest. Plants were shaded from direct-beam light (PFD = photosynthetic photon flux density) with shadow bands that still allowed receipt of most of the diffuse light. After two growing seasons the shaded plants receiving only diffuse light were significantly smaller than control plants that received both direct and diffuse light. In general, shaded plants decreased in size whereas those receiving sunflecks remained at the same size. Reproduction was reduced more than vegetative size in the shaded plants. Despite the dramatic effect of removing sunflecks from the light energy available to individual plants, we found no significant relationship between plant performance and the amount of direct PFD available in a microsite, as predicted from hemispherical canopy photographs. Instead, the size and reproductive output of plants growing under natural light regimes was correlated with the average daily diffuse light availability. Although additional direct PFD could be expected to increase carbon gain, the lack of a correlation between the amount of direct PFD and plant performance may be due to other factors such as water or nutrient stress that increase in microsites with increased direct light.

AB Plants in the same genus often differ by certain putative defense compounds even though they are attacked by the same or similar herbivores. We compared two such congeners in their interactions with the same seed predators. In the Sonoran Desert, seeds of the palo verdes Cercidium floridum and C. microphyllum (Leguminosae) were fed upon by the bruchid beetles Mimosestes amicus, M. ulkei, and Stator limbatus, several species of imperfect soil fungi, and at least one species of termite. Seed suitability was compared in field and laboratory experiments. Seeds of C. floridum were significantly more resistant except to a putative subpopulation of S. limbatus that normally feeds on C. floridum. Cercidium floridum seed resistance was located in the seed coat and was chemically based, as determined by a seed coat removal experiment and experiments in which we transferred extracts from resistant seeds to susceptible seeds. The resistance chemical(s) was not identified, though tests for tannins were negative. Alternatively, C. microphyllum abscised pods early, which significantly reduced attack by the seed predators. Early pod abscission was more effective at reducing seed predation than were resistant seed coats. We suggest that very different plant defense mechanisms may evolve under similar selection pressures within the same lineage, contrary to conventional wisdom.

AB Food limitation has been thought to explain the evolution of single-chick broods in pelagic seabirds. We compared the meal sizes, feeding rates, and time budgets of Masked Boobies (Sula dactylatra), typical pelagic seabirds, which raise one chick per breeding attempt, with those of sympatric Blue-footed Boobies (S. nebouxii), which often raise two or more chicks to fledging. Breeding adult Masked Boobies forage farther from land than do Blue-footed Boobies. If longer transit times caused Masked Boobies to deliver less food per day than did Blue-footed Boobies, and thus limited brood size, we expected Blue-footed Boobies, but not Masked Boobies, to be able to provision a two-chick brood. Analysis of chick meal size and adult foraging effort (time spent foraging) indicated that Blue-footed Booby parents could typically feed two, but not three, chicks; brood size thus matches feeding capacity in this species. Masked Boobies, however, appear to have sufficient excess foraging capacity to raise an additional chick, yet do not. The different brood sizes of these species are frequently cited to support the idea that foraging biology determines brood size in seabirds. In contrast, we conclude that Masked and Blue-footed Boobies have similar capacities to provision two-chick broods; some other factor limits Masked Boobies, but not Blue-footed Boobies, to fledging single chicks. Obligate siblicide clearly limits brood size at the proximate level in Masked, but not Blue-footed Boobies. A role for sibling competition also seems likely at the ultimate level, either through an interaction with delivery frequency or by driving genetic parent-offspring conflict over brood size.

AB To assess the temporal and spatial dynamics of soil water at a shortgrass steppe site in northcentral Colorado, we evaluated the precipitation regime for a 33-yr period and ran a simulation model for this period. Small precipitation events accounted for a large fraction of the total number of events and represented a source of water with small interannual variability. The difference between wet and dry years was related to the occurrence of a few large events.
   Average daily precipitation was concentrated during the warmest months of the year with a maximum in late spring. Water in the surface soil layers had a short residence time and no seasonal pattern. Intermediate layers reflected the seasonal pattern of precipitation. Maximum soil water availability occurred in the late spring, but this was also the period with the highest interannual variability.
   The wettest layer was at 4-15 cm of depth. The frequency of wet conditions decreased above this layer because of the strong influence of evaporation and below because recharge was infrequent. No deep percolation events were recorded. During dry years distribution of soil water was very shallow and during wet years wet conditions reached to depths of 120-135 cm.
   This shallow distribution of soil water matches the distribution of processes and structural elements in the steppe suggesting that there is a cause-effect relationship between them. We speculate that the pattern of water availability interacts with biotic constraints and determines the rate of ecosystem processes. The depth distribution of water in dry and wet years is compared to the root distribution of grasses, shrubs, herbs, and succulents to suggest the response of each group to modal and extreme conditions. Comparison of long-term soil water patterns and traits of the major species allows us to suggest why Bouteloua gracilis is the dominant species in the shortgrass steppe.

AB We address the task of determining the effects, on mean population density or other parameters, of an unreplicated perturbation, such as arises in environmental assessments and some ecosystem-level experiments. Our context is the Before-After-Control-Impact-Pairs design (BACIP): on several dates Before and After the perturbation, samples are collected simultaneously at both the Impact site and a nearby "Control."
   One approach is to test whether the mean of the Impact-Control difference has changed from Before to After the perturbation. If a conventional test is used, checks of its assumptions are an important and messy part of the analysis, since BACIP data do not necessarily satisfy them. It has been suggested that these checks are not needed for randomization tests, because they are insensitive to some of these assumptions and can be adjusted to allow for others. A major aim of this paper is to refute this suggestion: there is no panacea for the difficult and messy technical problems in the analysis of data from assessments or unreplicated experiments.
   We compare the randomization t test with the standard t test and the modified (Welch-Satterthwaite-Aspin) t test, which allows for unequal variances. We conclude that the randomization t test is less likely to yield valid inferences than is the Welch t test, because it requires identical distributions for small sample sizes and either equal variances or equal sample sizes for larger ones. The formal requirement of Normality is not crucial to the Welch t test.
   Both parametric and randomization tests require that time and location effects be additive and that Impact-Control differences on different dates be independent. These assumptions should be tested; if they are seriously wrong, alternative analyses are needed. This will often require a long time series of data.
   Finally, for assessing the importance of a perturbation, the P value of a hypothesis test is rarely as useful as an estimate of the size of the effect. Especially if effect size varies with time and conditions, flexible estimation methods with approximate answers are preferable to formally exact P values.

AB The diet of the predominantly herbivorous Bonaire Island whiptail lizard (Teiidae: Cnemidophorus murinus) was examined to assess three models of diet selection by generalist herbivores. These models were: single-nutrient maximizing, toxin avoiding, and nutritional wisdom. At three sites we gathered data on the diet of the lizard over a full year (both wet and dry seasons), on the relative abundance of all plant food types available to the lizards during that period, and on the nutritional composition of each plant type. Thirteen nutritional variables were measured, including content of energy, protein, minerals, water, and potentially toxic plant secondary compounds, and digestibility of protein.
   The lizards were generalist feeders, consuming a wide variety of flowers, fruits, leaves, nectar, and some animal material. Most stomachs contained more than one food type, suggesting C murinus typically samples several kinds of plant materials each day. The lizards were selective with regard to foods eaten; most foods were not taken in proportion to their availability in the environment. Potential plant foods varied in nutritional quality, but no one nutrient was correlated with dietary preferences. Multivariate analysis revealed that preference or avoidance of a potential food type could be predicted by a combination of nutritional properties, but these differed among sites. Despite differing plant assemblages at each site, annual intake of nutrients by the lizards was similar among sites. The results best support the nutritional wisdom hypothesis; the Bonaire whiptail lizard may assemble its diet to obtain the proper balance of required nutrients, while avoiding dangerous levels of plant secondary compounds.

AB On beaches along the Manu River of southeastern Peru, four bird species (Black Skimmer, Rynchops niger; Large-billed Tem, Phaetusa simplex; Yellow-billed Tern, Sterna superciliaris; Sand-colored Nighthawk, Chordeiles rupestris) nest in mixed-species associations. Costs and benefits of the association were distributed asymmetrically among the species. Nighthawks never actively defended their nests against predators. Terns and skimmers defended their nests by aggressively mobbing predators, and indirectly defended nearby or adjacent nests of nighthawks. As a result, nighthawks had greater hatching success when nesting near terns and skimmers. Terns and skimmers spent more time engaged in antipredator behaviors and being vigilant, but less time in parental care, and experienced lowered hatching success when among large nighthawk groups. In addition, both tern species fledged significantly fewer young per successful nest when nesting with many nighthawks. Results of this study demonstrate the first known parasitic relationship among members of a mixed-species nesting group.

AB Detecting mechanisms that structure ecological communities often requires investigations at appropriate spatial and temporal scales. A 15-mo, whole-lake experiment revealed direct and indirect mechanisms by which a fish predator structured its prey population, primarily by affecting recruitment of young-of-the-year (YOY) fish. Piscivorous Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) were added to two of four sections of a divided lake in eastern Finland previously stocked with crucian carp (Carassius carassius). Although the stocked crucians quickly grew beyond vulnerable sizes, recruitment of their offspring through their 1st yr of life was reduced by 90% in sections with perch. Surviving YOY in predator sections were completely confined to vegetated inshore areas. This restriction to refuges lowered their growth rates in comparison with YOY in predator-free sections, which can further reduce recruitment by prolonging susceptibility to size-limited predation and decreasing energy reserves needed for anaerobic overwintering. In the presence of piscivores, surviving prey subsequently benefit from reduced intraspecific competition, increasing growth rates to achieve large, invulnerable body sizes rapidly. Resulting populations of crucian carp, consisting of relatively few but relatively large individuals, contrast with populations living in the absence of piscivores, which are characterized by high densities of small, stunted individuals. Such divergent population patterns are displayed by a number of prey species in Scandinavia and North America, suggesting that a combination of direct and indirect effects of predation on younger age classes, such as documented for crucian carp, may be common in fish populations of small northern lakes. Detecting these patterns and identifying their underlying mechanisms may often require a combination of extensive and intensive studies.

AB Equations for predicting digestible protein and digestible dry matter on the basis of laboratory analytical techniques (Robbins et al. 1987 a, b) were tested with in vivo digestion trials using black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis).  Leaves of seven natural, tannin-containing forages and twigs from one browse species were fed fresh in total collection digestion trials.  The equation for estimating digestible protein was based on the plant's crude protein content and a measure of the tannin's protein-precipitating capacity.  The equation for estimating digestible dry matter was based on a measure of tannin astringency and the concentrations of neutral detergent fiber, lignin, cutin, and biogenic silica.  Both equations predicted in vivo results accurately, although a slight modification of the laboratory technique was recommended for determining neutral detergent fiber.  Sodium sulfite should be used when analyzing tannin-containing forb and shrub leaves and omitted for relatively tannin-free forages.  The equations provide useful measures of both the ecological effectiveness of tannins as digestion-reducing agents and the nutritional value of the ingested plant matter for the animal.

AB With the aim of assessing the principal structuring forces for algal biomass development, I conducted field studies along a productivity gradient of Swedish and Antarctic lakes. In accordance with predictions from current ecological theory, the regression line of planktonic algal biomass vs. the concentration of total phosphorus shows a steeper slope for Swedish (functionally three trophic levels) than for Antarctic lakes (functionally two trophic levels). This difference suggests that, besides the effect of nutrients, the food chain composition in aquatic systems has a crucial impact on the biomass development of planktonic algae. However, at very high productivity, phytoplankton biomass in the Antarctic lakes approached levels similar to those in Swedish lakes, suggesting that the algae "grew away" from being grazer regulated and instead became nutrient limited. The mechanistic connections between the components in the food chain, suggested by theory and the descriptive field study, were evaluated in an enclosure experiment. It may be concluded that classical food chain theory can explain a great deal of the variation.in the relation between phosphorus concentration and phytoplankton chlorophyll, frequently used by limnologists.

AB In a montane rain forest at almost-equal-to 2500 m in Venezuela we fertilized plots with N, with P, or with N and P for 4.5 yr. We measured trunk growth in circumference in control plots and in those fertilized with N and P, and measured litterfall in all four treatments. There were five 12 x 12 m plots per treatment. N was applied at 225 kg.ha-1.yr-1 and P at 75 kg.ha-1.yr-1 for the first 2 yr, and subsequently N was applied at 150 kg.ha-1.yr-1 and P at 50 kg.ha-1.yr-1.
   Rates of trunk growth in N and P fertilized plots were roughly double those in control plots (1.4 vs. 0.6 mm/yr). Total litterfall averaged 4.3 Mg.ha-1.yr-1 in the control plots. In the 4th yr after fertilization litterfall was significantly higher in plots fertilized with N + P (1.50 g.m-2.d-1) than in control plots (1.00 g.m-2.d-1). There were no significant differences in rates of litterfall between treatments during the first 3 yr after the first fertilization.
   The changes of rates of litterfall with time were significantly different between treatments. Litterfall in control plots fell by 9% per year, that in P-fertilized plots fell by 5% per year, and litterfall in N- and in N + P-fertilized plots remained approximately constant. Nitrogen concentrations in litterfall were unaffected by fertilization with N or with P. Phosphorus concentrations were significantly increased by P fertilization. We conclude that N is more limiting than P in this forest.

AB To determine the long-term effect of alder on soil fertility, biogeochemical fluxes were measured and calculated for two pairs of adjacent, 55-yr-old stands dominated by conifers, primarily Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and by conifers and nitrogen-fixing red alder (Alnus rubra). At a low-fertility site in the Wind River Experimental Forest in southwestern Washington, biomass of the alder-conifer stand (289 Mg/ha) exceeded that of the conifer stand (171 Mg/ha), and the aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of the alder-conifer stand (10.3 Mg . ha-1 . yr-1) was more than twice that of the conifer stand (4.8 Mg . ha-1 . yr-1). At a more fertile site in the Cascade Head Experimental Forest in western Oregon, both biomass and ANPP were higher than at Wind River, and biomass and ANPP were higher in the conifer stand (5 84 Mg/ha and 19.2 Mg . ha-1 . yr-1) than in the alder-conifer stand (342 Mg/ha and 10.7 Mg . ha-1 . yr-1). Nitrogen accretion in the alder-conifer stand at Wind River averaged 54 kg . ha-1 . yr-1 for the 52 yr since stand establishment, with a current rate of N fixation of almost-equal-to 75 kg . ha-1 . yr-1. For the alder-conifer stand at Cascade Head, N accretion averaged 73 kg . ha-1 . yr-1 for 55 yr, with a current N-fixation rate of 85 kg . ha-1 . yr-1.
   The cycling of all nutrients appeared very malleable under the influence of alder. At Wind River, return of nutrients in fine litterfall in the alder-conifer stand ranged from 1.5 (P) to 7.9 (N) times those in the conifer stand; whereas at Cascade Head, these ratios ranged from 1.7 (S) to 4.2 (N). Nutrient-use efficiencies (kilograms of ANPP per kilogram of nutrient uptake) were generally lower for the alder-conifer stands at both sites. Denitrification appeared negligible (<0.3 kg . ha-1 . yr-1) in all stands. Leaching of organic plus inorganic N ranged from almost-equal-to 5 kg . ha-1 . yr-1 for the conifer stand at Wind River, to 50 Kg . ha-1 . yr-1 for the alder-conifer stand at Cascade Head.

AB We examined effects of disturbance timing on resistance and resilience of epilithic algal communities growing in fast- (29 cm/s) and slow- (12 cm/s) current outdoor experimental stream channels in Kentucky, USA that were either left undisturbed (control) over 33 d following a simulated spate, or were subjected to an additional spate after either 9, 18, 27, or 33 d.  On day 33, all channels were subjected to a final spate to assess effects of short-term disturbance history on resistance, independently of seasonal influences.  Succession proceeded from a sparsely populated community dominated by a small, monoraphid diatom (Achnanthes minutissima) immediately after the initial spate, to dominance by dense floating mats of filamentous green algae (Zygnematales:  Mougeotia and Spirogyra) and Synedra spp. by day 21-24.  Resistance was generally lower in slow-current communities, both in terms of cell-density reduction and displacement of taxonomic structure, than in fast-current communities.  Resistance in slow-current communities varied temporally, with communities least resistant on day 18, when community composition and physiognomy was changing rapidly, and on day 33, when green algal mats began to senesce.  On day 33, slow-current communities that had not been recently disturbed (control, D9) exhibited greatest spate-induced loss of algal biomass.  Additionally, slow-current communities with high pre-disturbance phaeophytin content (an indicator of algal senescence) also changed most in diatom assemblage structure across the final spate.  No such relationship was noted in fast current, suggesting that autogenic factors influenced communities in slow current more than those in fast.  Resilience was higher in slow-current communities than in fast current, with disturbed communities reaching biomass and taxonomic structure similar to controls after 3-9 d.  High resilience in slow current resulted from enhanced reproduction in some populations following spate-induced biomass reduction and presumed release from nutrient and light limitation, and low shear stress relative to fast-current channels where biomass accrual was limited by current.  Interactions between disturbance timing, successional state, and habitat affect the susceptibility of epilithic algal communities to disturbance and likely influence temporal and spatial heterogeneity in stream ecosystems.

AB Freshwater fishes exhibit spectacular biodiversity in the tropics. In contrast to temperate streams, where insectivorous fishes generally predominate, detrital- and algal-feeding fishes are widespread components of tropical ichthyofaunas. I compared the direct and indirect effects of a variety of fishes in structuring a neotropical stream insect assemblage. An exclosure/enclosure experiment was performed to examine the role of different fish trophic guilds and densities on patterns of patch colonization by invertebrates.
   Insectivorous characid fishes had relatively weak impacts on overall invertebrate abundance, although significant reductions were observed for selected taxa (the mayflies Baetis sp. 2 and Leptohyphes, and the caddisflies Smicridea and Alisotrichia). This contrasted sharply with the strong effects of the grazing armored catfish Chaetostoma milesi and the detritivore Prochilodus mariae, which caused significant reductions in abundance of common taxa throughout the invertebrate assemblage. In addition, grazers and detritivores substantially reduced the amount of sediments and associated detritus accumulated on stream bottom substrata.
   A second experiment was performed to evaluate the mechanism by which grazing and detritivorous fishes influence insect abundance. Insect abundance was compared between a treatment where resource depression and bioturbation were simulated by removing sediments manually to fish exclosure/enclosure treatments. As in the previous experiment, grazers and detritivores significantly reduced the abundance of many common invertebrate taxa, as well as detrital and algal resources. However, taxon-specific differences in colonization of the sediment-removal treatment suggest that several factors are important in explaining responses to fishes by insects. Many common taxa displayed decreases in abundance both in sediment-removal and fish treatments, indicating that sediment-processing activities by epibenthic fishes are important in explaining patch colonization for many members of the invertebrate assemblage. However, sediment depletion is not sufficient to explain the response of the abundant invertebrate, Baetis sp. 1, which showed substantial reductions in cages containing fishes (open and grazer enclosures), but high densities in both the fish-exclusion and the sediment-removal treatments. These data suggest that intimidation by fish, as measured by the presence of grazers, results in low rates of patch use by this numerically dominant mayfly.
   These findings contrast with studies reporting relatively weak effects of fishes in temperate zone streams. Fishes may be strong interactors in some neotropical streams, not through direct lethal consumption of prey, but rather by modifying the distribution and abundance of resources important to stream insects. In some instances the simple intimidation associated with the presence of a diverse and abundant fauna of bottom-feeding fishes also may influence insect abundance and distribution.

AB Wide-ranging but ecologically variable species and their close relatives provide the best opportunity to analyze the role of trade-offs in specialization.  Poecilochirus carabi Can. is a holarctically distributed mite that rides between patches of carrion on the bodies of carrion beetles (Silphidae, Nicrophorus).  Using behavioral tests, we demonstrated differences in local host specialization of P. carabi at two sites in Michigan, the Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) and the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS).  At KBS, Nicrophorus orbicollis and N. tomentosus each supported a strict host specialist.  These KBS "orbicollis- and tomentosus-specialists" differed significantly in both body size and a measure of dorsal setal lengths.  Laboratory crosses between specialists were not successful, suggesting that the specialists are distinct species.  At UMBS, in contrast, such strong specialists were not found.  Mites preferred two beetle species, N. tomentosus or N. defodiens (a species not found at KBS), over all others, but moved between these two species readily.  UMBS mites all resembled the KBS tomentosus-specialist in morphology.  No orbicollis-specialist mites were found at UMBS, despite the high relative abundance of N. orbicollis in the beetle community.
   We raised mites from each site on all available hosts to test whether preference for a host species was associated with higher fitness in association with that host species.  Although P. carabi were able to reproduce in association with any Nicrophorus species, mites at UMBS had the highest reproductive success on the two species that they preferred.  Each KBS specialist mite was raised in association with N. tomentosus and N. orbicollis.  While the tomentosus-specialist had significantly higher reproductive success in association with its preferred host species, the orbicollis-specialist showed no difference in reproductive success between the two host species.  However, when the pattern of dispersal on beetles was considered, a difference in fitness between the two hosts was apparent.  This difference in dispersal pattern was due to an interaction between the parental behavior of the two host species and mite generation time.  We discuss the evidence for trade-offs in this system and the use of interspecific comparisons in the analysis of specialization.

AB Plant stress theory predicts and many observational studies support the notion that abiotic stress can increase plant quality and benefit the performance of phytophagous insects.  Paradoxically, numerous experiments contradict this assumption.  To test the theory, we conducted experiments to determine the influence of pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) stress on pinyon sawfly (Neodiprion edulicolis) performance.  In a natural pinyon population, we transferred first-instar sawfly larvae to 41 trees divided into four groups of 11; each group received either water, fertilizer, water and fertilizer, or no supplements.  Upon completion of their penultimate larval instar, we collected sawflies and determined their fecundity and sex ratios.  Although sex ratios are rarely used to estimate insect performance in natural systems, we believe that their sensitivity to changes in plant quality may play an overlooked role in insect-plant interactions.
   Most of our results refuted theoretical predictions, because sawflies performed better on trees receiving both water and fertilizer.  However, in some cases, sawflies did benefit from pinyon stress.  We contend that "simultaneous plant stress," such as low precipitation while the insect is feeding or ovipositing, can reduce performance.  In contrast, "sustained plant stress," such as chronically poor soil conditions or prolonged drought, can benefit insect performance.  These different effects on herbivores may parsimoniously explain some discrepancies between theoretical and empirical plant stress studies.

AB Insect defoliation is commonly associated with and assumed to be a cause of mortality in Australian eucalypts, particularly in rural regions where trees suffer from the eucalypt dieback syndrome. To test this, leaf growth and defoliation were measured in the canopies of Eucalyptus trees from June 1982 to June 1986, and related to tree health and eucalypt dieback. Over 5000 leaves were monitored, including replicates of branches, canopy heights, individual trees, species, and sites. Three types of sites were selected, representing the most common conditions in the eastern Australian tablelands: woodlands (comprised of healthy trees but with slight signs of dieback), healthy trees in pastures, and dying trees in pastures. Within each site the commonest native tree species were selected for study; species were not always the same between adjacent sites because of interspecific differences in distribution patterns.
   Some eucalypt species suffered much greater defoliation than others, and this was related to their observed susceptibility to dieback. Eucalyptus nova-anglica (peppermint) and E. stellulata lost up to 300% and 274% of leaf surface area, respectively, in one year, and these trees suffered severe dieback. In contrast, E. caliginosa and E dalrympleana annually lost as little as 20% and 8%, respectively, and showed little evidence of dieback. Other aspects of leaf growth were quantified for each canopy, including numbers of leaves flushing, amounts of leaf area affected by galls and miners, and leaf longevities. More than half of the leaves monitored senesced from causes other than insect damage. Defoliating insects appeared to have a greater impact on eucalypts in Australia than they do on forest and pasture trees of other continents.

AB Food limitation during the nestling stage was experimentally investigated in an urban population of Carrion Crows. Parents were offered supplemental food during the nestling period and the following variables compared with those from non food-supplemented pairs: (1) nesting success, (2) fledgling number, (3) fledgling mass and linear body size, (4) proportion of fledglings resighted (a) after transition to independence from the parents, and (b) after the first winter postfledging, and (5) the probability that a fledgling became a breeder. Food-supplemented pairs had a higher nesting success and produced more fledglings. The fledglings of food-supplemented pairs were heavier and bigger in tarsus length than controls, but experimental and control fledglings were seen in equal proportions both after transition to independence and after the first winter. The production of potential breeders was increased ninefold in food-supplemented pairs. The study demonstrates that in this urban habitat food limitation causes low fitness not through lowered survival, but through the production of a low number of potential breeders.

AB We used a field experiment to test for effects of the algae-grazing minnow Campostoma anomalum on stream ecosystem dynamics. Eight whole pools in Brier Creek, in south-central Oklahoma (USA), served as replicates. Following a stream-resetting flood, four pools with natural densities of Campostoma and four pools with no Campostoma were maintained by fences across riffles for 61 d. Subsequently, a changeover was conducted. Fish were removed from two of the previously grazed pools and added to two of the previously nongrazed pools; the other four pools remained as grazed and nongrazed controls. The changeover was maintained for 33 d.
   A repeated-measures analysis of variance showed significant grazing or grazing x time effects for variables related to organic matter processing, algal primary productivity and community composition, and invertebrate density. Principal components analysis showed complete separation of grazing treatments on the combined first two axes (accounting for 34.6% of the variance). Correlations of variables with these axes corresponded to results of the univariate ANOVAs; pools with Campostoma had lower algal standing crops, higher biomass-specific net primary productivity, greater percent blue-green algae, lower areal coverage by filamentous green algae, lower bacterial density, smaller benthic particulate organic matter fractions, and higher invertebrate density than pools without Campostoma. The changeover indicated that effects of grazing by these fish can be rapid when they enter nongrazed pools, but that effects can linger in formerly grazed pools despite markedly reduced densities of these algivorous fish.

AB Density dependence plays an important role in the regulation of most populations. Descriptive studies provide only limited evidence, while density manipulations are thought to be a more powerful tool. Here, we describe such a manipulation.
   We experimentally analyzed demographic responses to changes in density in common lizard (Lacerta vivipara) populations. Two neighboring sites were studied from 1986 to 1988. At the end of the first year, density was artificially decreased at one site and increased at the other. The evolution of demographic parameters over time (before and after manipulation) was compared between the two sites. We found that: (1) density in each age and sex class quickly converged to pre-experimental values at both sites; (2) survival rates (introduced individuals excluded) were unchanged, except that juvenile mortality was positively related to density; (3) emigration rates remained low and did not seem to be influenced by density, while immigration rates were negatively influenced by density; (4) the proportion of young reproductive females was negatively influenced by density; (5) body length and growth rate were negatively influenced by density only in yearlings, and at least in females, no catchup on growth is apparently possible; no difference in reserve storage was found; and (6) female reproduction was modified by the manipulation through clutch size and hatching success, which were negatively influenced by density; however, no difference was detected for hatching date, number of abortive (clear) eggs, prenatal mortality, reproductive investment, and body mass of live neonates.
   Rapid density readjustments were mostly explained by immigration into the site where density was decreased, and by high mortality of introduced individuals and of native juveniles where density was increased. Other parameters that were influenced by the manipulation could only have induced delayed effects on population density.
   Different age and sex classes showed different responses to density. These responses indicate that density dependence plays a key role in shaping the demography of this lizard species.

AB Camel Lake records the vegetation history of northwest Florida from approximately 40000 yr BP to the present. The Middle Wisconsin, from 40000 to 29000 yr BP, was a time of forests with abundant pine, oak, and diverse mesic tree species. Chestnut (Castanea) was an important element in the vegetation before 31000 yr BP. The Late Wisconsin forest (29000 yr BP to 14000 yr BP) was a species-poor pine forest. The Wisconsin-age forests varied greatly in species composition from time to time, probably because of climatic variation. From 14000 to 12 000 yr BP Picea (spruce) was present with northern aquatics in forest with abundant Carya (hickory) and other deciduous trees. This is believed to be the coldest phase recorded at Camel Lake, with a suggested climate of-5-degrees-C January mean temperatures. similar to southern Quebec today. After 12000 yr BP the forest was oak-dominated with diverse deciduous hardwoods, unlike northeast Florida, which at that time had a less mesic flora with some prairie development and low lake levels with many dried-out lake basins. Sedimentation in shallow water was continuous at Camel Lake in the early Holocene, but a sudden change in sediment type and pollen composition indicates a hiatus between 10020 and 7760 yr BP. After the hiatus modem turkey oak/long-leaf pine forests were present. There was a rise of some 4 m in the water table in the later Holocene, and cypress swamps and bayheads developed. The climates indicated by pollen data are in conflict with the simulations of published general circulation models (GCMs) for both the Late Wisconsin and the Holocene. Discrepancies may be explained by the particular boundary conditions used for the models, especially an assumption of little change in ocean temperatures at the latitude of Florida.

AB Mechanisms of interactions between Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and red alder (Alnus rubra) seedlings were assessed in experimentally manipulated stands. The density of each species was varied systematically, creating a matrix of competitive regimes that consisted of five monoculture densities and 25 mixtures of all possible pairwise combinations of the monoculture densities. Response surfaces for growth rates, leaf area, photon flux density, soil moisture content and depletion, and plant water potential were generated within the matrix. Regression coefficients quantified the effects of species densities on response variables, and correlation analysis yielded insight into interrelationships between variables. Tree performance, leaf area per square metre of ground surface area, resources, and physiological variables were all quantitatively altered by alder density, Douglas-fir density, and the interaction between species densities.
   Alder was the dominant competitor and overtopped the Douglas-fir. Competition for light was mediated by density effects on the leaf area of each species per square metre of ground surface area. Increasing alder leaf area reduced the light reaching the understory Douglas-fir. In contrast, increasing Douglas-fir leaf areas increased the light penetrating through to the understory conifers, due to Douglas-fir's suppression of alder leaf area per square metre. Soil moisture limitations were also created by increasing the density of both species and resulted in increasingly negative leaf water potentials for both species. Growth rates concurrently declined as plant water stress increased. Response variables were assembled into a conceptual modeling proposing how species density regulated growth through the interactions between resource limitations and impairment of physiological function.

AB Natural landscapes subject to disturbances have a patchy structure that is important to many species living in these landscapes. This structure may be modified when the disturbance regime is altered by either climatic change or human influences (e.g., fire suppression), yet little is known about how this structure will change.
   I used a GIS (geographic information system)-based spatial model and data on historical changes in fire sizes and intervals to simulate the effects of settlement and fire suppression on the structure of the landscape in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, Minnesota. I used seven measures to assess change in landscape structure.
   Settlement and fire suppression altered some but not all components of landscape structure. Settlement produced an immediate significant effect on some measures (age, shape, Shannon diversity, richness, and angular second moment), but no effect on other measures (size, fractal dimension). In contrast, suppression produced an immediate response in fewer measures (shape, Shannon diversity, richness), a delay for several decades in the case of some measures (age, fractal dimension), and a delay for hundreds of years in the case of other measures (size, angular second moment).
   Landscapes that have been altered by settlement and fire suppression cannot be restored using traditional methods of prescribed burning, which will simply produce further alteration. Causes of landscape change cannot be separated without control landscapes that lack prescribed burning, fire suppression, or other alterations of the natural fire regime.

AB Predation by fish (roach, Hesperoleucas symmetricus, and steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss) produced strong cascading effects on biota associated with boulder-bedrock substrates in pools of a northern California river, but not on gravel-dwelling biota. Enclosure-exclosure experiments in the South Fork Eel River of northern California (39-degrees 44' N, 123-degrees 39' W) showed that fish, by suppressing densities of damselfly nymphs and other small predators, released algivorous chironomids (Pseudochironomus richardsoni) from predation. Chironomids in tum dramatically reduced algal standing crops. In contrast, fish had little effect on algae or invertebrates associated with gravel. Gravel-dwelling heptageniid mayflies were behaviorally inhibited from using tops of stones in fish enclosures, and stone surfaces had more chironomid tubes in fish enclosures than in fish exclosures. However, no effects on epilithic algae or densities of invertebrates comparable to those of biota on boulder-bedrock substrates were detected. These spatially varying predator effects in a river parallel results from marine benthic systems, where strong effects of large predators documented for rocky intertidal habitats and unvegetated soft bottoms are not conspicuous in seagrass beds.

AB A small-variance approximation technique for examining the evolution of reproductive effort is developed, using a decomposition of fitness into arithmetic mean and variance components.  Trait values often translate nonlinearly into fitness components such as offspring number or growth rate.  A nonlinear relationship between phenotypic traits and fitness implies that the expected value of the fitness component will be a function of the arithmetic mean and variance in the traits influencing a given fitness component.  The maximum expression of traits is often, however, a function of reproductive effort.  Reproductive effort then influences the mean and variance in traits that affect fitness.  Consequently, we can use these techniques to determine the optimal allocation of resources to current reproduction via their effects on the distribution of trait values.  The optimal pattern of allocation is influenced by the quality and variability of the habitat and by the curvature of the trait-fitness relationship.  The full range of adaptive responses, from semelparity to different degrees of iteroparity, can be predicted from the model.  We extend the model to cases where reproductive effort can be partitioned into different offspring types, for example, offspring produced through chasmogamous and cleistogamous flowers.  When more than one type of offspring is produced, then reproductive risks can be spread across offspring types and the conditions favoring semelparity are less restrictive.  Semelparity is especially favored if the offspring types exhibit negative covariance in their contributions to growth rate.  This new technique appears generally consistent with traditional life history theory, but can lead to some new insights that result from the explicit partitioning of the effects of central tendency and variability in trait-fitness relationships.

Distributional patterns and relative abundances of the clones were stable over the 4-yr interval.  Three clones dominated the assemblage, comprising > 75% of the animals.  One of these clones dominated saline habitats while the other two displayed a checkerboard distribution in low-salinity ponds.  The latter distributional pattern appeared linked to the presence of a predatory copepod, Hesperodiaptomus arcticus, in some ponds.
   Manipulation experiments showed that abiotic variables (e.g., salinity) played a role in excluding clones from some habitats, but that many habitats were invasible by a broader spectrum of clones than was ever detected in them.  Experiments showed that clones were ordinarily superior in their home environments, supporting the role of competition in limiting local richness.  The experimental results were not totally congruent with the clones' natural distributions, as one clone became dominant in all of the low-salinity manipulation ponds.  This outcome was reversed by introducing H. arcticus into ponds.  The results confirm that clonal diversity is maintained by physical and biological variation in the system, and demonstrate that substantial taxon diversity can be sustained in the absence of marked ecological divergence.

AB It has been suggested that the structure of ecological communities is constrained by dynamical instability of certain configurations of interacting species.  Analysis of this has most often been based on asymptotic (local) stability analysis of equilibria at which all species are present, on the grounds that a configuration with an unstable equilibrium is less likely to occur in the real world than one with an asymptotically stable equilibrium.  Since species may also coexist on limit cycles or chaotic orbits, we argue that a global condition that species should increase when rare could be more appropriate.  Conditions for such "permanence" exist and their use makes it possible to focus on fundamental qualitative questions of coexistence of species, even though the quantitative properties of their dynamics may be very complex.
   We describe a straightforward and general method for distinguishing between permanent and nonpermanent Lotka-Volterra food webs; this method is due to Jansen (1987).  A numerical analysis of four-species food webs with different degrees of omnivory shows that many that would be rejected as unstable in a local analysis are at the same time permanent in the global analysis.  Using permanence methods, food webs of high connectance are shown to rebuild themselves more readily than those of low connectance, and therefore to recover more readily from disturbance than those of low connectance.  The significance of this result for the relationship between complexity and stability of communities is discussed, together with the merits and drawbacks of permanence for studying the coexistence of species in communities.

AB The idea that plant polyphenols act as digestibility-reducing compounds is well entrenched. This hypothesis has recently been countered with the proposal that the presence of surfactants in the gut fluids of herbivores may preclude the digestibility-reducing effects of plant polyphenols. We examined three marine isopods, three limpets, and a rock lobster, and established that surfactants are present in the digestive fluids of all of these organisms. However, further determinations of the efficacy with which these surfactants can prevent the complexation of proteins by brown-algal polyphenols in vitro revealed substantial differences between species. Moreover, in cases where the surfactants were ineffective, polyphenols reduced in vitro digestibility in a dose-dependent manner. We therefore conclude that the presence of gut surfactants does not necessarily preclude protein precipitation by polyphenols in vivo. Thus polyphenols might still be regarded as digestibility-reducing compounds, since gut surfactants only counter these effects in some cases.

AB Nestling Cliff Swallows (Hirundo pyrrhonota) in southwestern Nebraska that were relatively heavily parasitized by hematophagous fleas (Ceratophyllus celsus) and swallow bugs (Oeciacus vicarius) dispersed to nonnatal colonies to breed the subsequent year, whereas nestlings that were relatively lightly parasitized returned to their natal colony to breed. There were no significant differences between dispersers and nondispersers in natal clutch size, natal brood size, relative hatching date, natal body mass, natal nest's distance from the colony's center, and natal nest's age. There were no sex differences in dispersal tendencies. Dispersing birds tended to move to smaller colonies to breed, and in some cases settled in breeding colonies later than nondispersers. Ectoparasitism may be a major cause of natal dispersal in Cliff Swallows and perhaps should be considered another potential cause of dispersal in general, especially in group-living species that may be associated with large numbers of highly co-evolved ectoparasites.

AB In dense populations, most planthoppers (Homoptera:Delphacidae) produce fully winged migratory forms that can escape to new habitats.  Under less crowded conditions, flightless morphs with reduced wings result.  For two sympatric species, Prokelisia marginata and Prokelisia dolus, interspecific crowding was found to be as strong a stimulus for the production of migrants as intraspecific crowding.  The effects were reciprocal for both species and were demonstrated both in the laboratory and field.  However, because migratory forms were triggered at a much lower density in P. marginata than P. dolus, interspecific interactions were asymmetric, with P. dolus having a far greater influence on the wing form of P. marginata.  Interspecific interactions did not directly influence survival, development time, or body size, but reproductive capability was indirectly affected because migratory females are less fecund than their flightless counterparts.
   Intraspecific crowding adversely affected the survivorship, development time, and body size of P. marginata, but had no influence on the fitness of P. dolus.  P. marginata is a much more migratory species than P. dolus.  Consequently, mobility is associated with the extent that each species' fitness is reduced by intraspecific crowding.
   Our results demonstrate that for wing dimorphic insects, the effects of interspecific competition can be extended to include altered wing form, a character that directly influences dispersal capability as well as reproductive potential.  We suggest that when wing-dimorphic species share a common habitat, interspecific interactions can influence population dynamics by increasing emigration and decreasing population growth.

AB Survival rates of adult and juvenile Lesser Snow Geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) were estimated based on hunter recoveries from over 80 000 geese banded between 1970 and 1988 at La Perouse Bay, near Churchill, Manitoba.  Adult survival rate increased significantly from almost-equal-to 78% in 1970 to nearly 88% in 1987.  Similar increases in adult survival, although not significant, occurred between 1969 and 1979 at a second colony of Snow Geese at Cape Henrietta Maria in Northern Ontario.  These increases coincided with a decline in the proportion of Snow Geese being shot each year on the flyways, suggesting that reduced mortality from hunting may be responsible for the increased survival.  In contrast, survival rates of fledglings over their first year decreased significantly from a mean of 60% in 1970 to almost-equal-to 30% in 1987, despite the reduction in hunting pressure.  This indicates that young geese have been suffering increasing rates of nonhunting mortality, most likely prior to leaving the breeding grounds or on their first autumn migration.  Their increased mortality appears to be related to slower growth rates and reduced body size induced by deteriorating feeding conditions on the breeding grounds.  This study shows that different processes can influence mortality rates at different stages of the life cycle.  The long-term changes indicate that mean values of age-specific survival rates are not adequate to describe the dynamics of this population.

AB Experimental manipulations of aquatic predators (odonate naiads and fishes) and prey (three tadpole species: Osteocephalus taurinus, Phyllomedusa tomopterna, and Epipedobates femoralis) investigated the role of predators in the organization of a tropical larval anuran assemblage. Eighteen months of surveys of 31 primary forest lentic sites examined phenological patterns of tadpole and predator species. I tested for a relation between predator and metamorph presence using the Mantel-Haenszel chi-square. I tested for differences in survival and development for each tadpole species as a function of predator identity. I examined correlations between growth of surviving tadpoles and both the number of conspecific and the total number of surviving tadpoles. Two-way ANOVAs tested for differences in predation rate among predators and experiments. Finally, I tested for differences in selectivity for each prey species.
   Odonate naiads were the most common predator in upland isolated pools and peccary wallows, while fish were most common in lowland, stream-associated habitats. No relation was found between the presence of metamorphs and of predators in natural sites, except for metamorph presence (a positive relation for all tadpole species pooled) and presence of aeshnid larvae in natural sites.
   Predators reduced tadpole survival in three of four different prey-species combinations. Aeshnid naiads were the most effective predators, followed by libellulid naiads. Fish were never the most effective predators and their effect was variable. Predation rate on each of the three prey species varied among predators and sometimes depended upon which species were present, indicating that predation rate in the system was a function of the particular combination of prey species. No significant differences were found in selectivity for any prey species among individual predator types. All predators, however, preferred P. tomopterna, the less abundant species, over O. taurinus whenever the two species were together. Growth of tadpoles was inversely related to the number of surviving conspecific tadpoles. Predators, therefore, have the potential to modify the composition of tadpole species assemblages through differential predation.

AB The mathematical theory of animal diseases has seen explosive growth in the past decade, yet most of the existing theory examines only temporal disease spread, ignoring the effects of patchy host or pathogen spatial distributions.  Here I present a model for the within-season spatial spread of insect pathogens that incorporates host movement in an otherwise conventional insect host-pathogen model.  Mathematical analysis of the model reveals that the pathogen will spread through the host population in a moving wave front of disease, known as a "travelling wave."  This analysis shows how the spatial rate of spread of the pathogen depends upon the transmission rate of the disease, the rate of production of the pathogen by infected hosts, the initial population of the host, the decay rate of the pathogen, and the death rate of infected hosts.
   To test the predictions of the model, I performed a series of field experiments with the nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) of Douglas-fir tussock moth, Orgyia pseudotsugata.  First, I estimated each of the parameters of the model in the field with a series of small-scale experiments, and used the parameter estimates to predict the spatial rate of spread of the NPV through a population of tussock moth larvae (NPV diseases, like many insect pathogens, do not infect adults).  To test this prediction, I then performed an experiment in which I measured the rate of spread of the NPV in an experimental population of tussock moth larvae on linear arrays of Douglas-fir seedlings.  The model predicts the rate of spread of tussock moth NPV fairly accurately, suggesting that one can use this type of model to extrapolate individual behavior and localized transmission patterns to broader-scale spatial dynamics.

AB North American heteromyid rodents are alike in their primary seed harvesting behavior (scratch-digging), which is a potentially important component of their foraging energetics. The present study was designed to quantify the energy cost and efficiency ([Benefit - Cost]/Cost) of scratch-digging throughout the body size range represented among the Heteromyidae. The resting energy expenditure of bipeds was generally greater than that of quadrupeds on an equal body size basis, whereas their energy expenditure during scratch-digging (DMR) was equivalent. Seed concentration and substrate bulk-density did not markedly affect DMR, but seed concentration did alter the rate of seed harvest. Species differences in seed harvest rate were correlated with mode of locomotion, supporting the hypothesis that bipedality is correlated with specialization of the forelimbs for seed handling.
   In heteromyids, resting metabolic rate (RMR) was elevated by a factor of 1.5 over basal metabolic rate (BMR); DMR was elevated by a factor of 3.4 over BMR and by a factor of 2.3 over RMR. DMR, seed harvest rate, and the energy cost of scratch-digging on a per seed basis scaled with body mass to the 0.65, 0.31, and 0.33 powers, respectively. Although large bipedal heteromyids harvested seeds at more than twice the rates of small quadrupedal heteromyids, the unequal scaling of DMR and harvest rate makes them less efficient at scratch-digging. In comparison with other heteromyids, the kangaroo mouse (Microdipodops megacephalus) was exceptionally efficient at scratch-digging. Its higher efficiency may allow it to forage on sparsely distributed seeds in open areas where the energy return would be inadequate for larger bipeds. The pocket mouse (Chaetodipus baileyi) was exceptionally inefficient at scratch-digging. Its low efficiency in sand may be correlated with specialization for foraging in pebbly soils. For heteromyids of a given size, factors affecting pouching rate are most likely to determine foraging efficiency because DMR is essentially a fixed cost.

AB The use of stable isotopes of bioelements to analyze diets of animals in nature requires precise knowledge of any changes in the isotope ratios that take place after assimilation.  Therefore, the influence of diet on the distribution of carbon and nitrogen isotopes in feathers of 11 species of birds on a constant diet was studied.  The standard deviation in delta-C-13 and delta-N-15 in naturally obtained foods like fish during 6 yr was almost-equal-to 1 parts per thousand.  Factory-manufactured pellets generally gave lower deviations (0.2 parts per thousand for delta-C-13 and almost-equal-to 0.6 parts per thousand for delta-N-15).  Feathers showed an enrichment relative to food in both C-13 and N-15, although its extent varied among different bird species.  Isotope ratios for C-13 and N-15 from diet to feathers converged.  The nature of the enrichment factors is discussed in relation to the convergence and temporal window size.  Neither enrichment showed an age dependency among adult birds, and neither depended on the nitrogen content in the bird's diet.  These results show that the stable isotope approach can be applied not only to these 11 species but to birds whose isotope enrichment factors are so far unknown.

AB The population dynamics of the Song Sparrow, Melospiza melodia, were studied for 15 yr on Mandarte Island, in southwestern British Columbia, Canada. This population exhibited a high median density (7.8 females/ha) and fluctuated strongly (10-fold or more) from year to year. The population received few successful immigrants, even at low densities, and its dynamics were thus driven by local events. Two strong density-dependent regulating mechanisms were detected. First, reproductive output was strongly depressed at high densities because of an increased rate of nest failure and a decline in mean clutch size. Greater nest failure at high density was due to increased predation on eggs and nestlings. Nest failure increased with the rate of nest parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) and was lowest when cowbirds were absent from Mandarte, suggesting that cowbirds either cause or facilitate nest failure. Second, the rate of juvenile recruitment was inversely related to the density of adults, because of interference competition for breeding territories between adults and yearlings. The survival rate of adults was independent of population density. Survival rates of adults and juveniles were negatively affected by weather in February 1989 when an unusually cold spell coincided with the loss of over 90% of the population. A second severe population crash occurred during the winter of 1979-1980, but the cause of this crash is not known. On two other occasions, periods of severe winter weather occurred at the same time as a substantial fraction of the population disappeared. However, not all periods of poor weather were accompanied by marked disappearances of birds. Adult females survived better than adult males during the breeding season but equally well outside it. We found no correlations between the survival rates of juveniles and adult males and females in years without a population crash, suggesting that there is no common cause underlying the observed variation in survival among age and sex classes in most years. Simple models of the population indicate that either density-dependent reproductive success or density-dependent recruitment of locally hatched juveniles can regulate population size. These two regulatory factors operate in a sequential and independent manner. Despite the presence of strong regulating factors, population crashes caused marked instability in population size, nearly leading to extinction in 1989. The rate of juvenile recruitment was the only factor closely related to the net rate of population growth in noncrash years and in all years combined, indicating that juvenile recruitment is the central factor affecting the abundance of Song Sparrows on Mandarte Island.

AB During summer 1987, a series of experiments was performed in conjunction with monitoring of in situ plankton dynamics in nutrient-deficient Castle Lake, California. These factorial manipulations of nutrients and zooplankton were designed to separate the direct (grazing mortality) and indirect (stimulation of algal growth by nutrient recycling) effects of grazers on both species-specific phytoplankton dynamics, as well as aggregate properties such as total biomass, productivity, and biomass turnover. Grazing loss rates differed significantly among algal species with the mean grazing loss rate suffered by an algal species a negative function of cell or colony size. Stimulation of division rates in the presence of zooplankton (compared to an unenriched treatment lacking zooplankton) was commonly observed. Nutrient and grazer treatments also had significant impacts on algal biomass (indicated by chlorophyll concentration), productivity (PPR), and PPR/chlorophyll, and significant nutrient-grazer interactions were frequently observed. Species-specific algal responses to grazers were aggregated across the phytoplankton by weighting species-specific parameters by the contribution of each species to total community biomass in order to provide community-wide estimates of the importance of direct and indirect effects on algal dynamics. Finally, linkages between population-level responses and aggregate properties were demonstrated by examining relationships between total phytoplankton biovolume concentration and chlorophyll concentration in various treatments, by comparing community-wide grazing rates estimated from aggregated species-specific grazing rates and from changes in chlorophyll growth rates, and by relating the aggregated degree of species-specific growth stimulation to stimulation of biomass turnover. These results indicate that phytoplankton responses to grazers in Castle Lake reflect a mix of direct and indirect effects that varies considerably both between species and through time during the stratified season.

AB The sea urchin Diadema antillarum increases the relative size of Aristotle's lantern (length of demipyramid) when food limited. This provides a tool for investigating algal abundance and biotic interactions in the past. A field collection of D. antillarum provided a baseline relationship between demipyramid length and body size (test diameter). Experimental manipulations of food availability and population density resulted in shifts in relative demipyramid length. The baseline and experimental data provide a range of responses that was compared to museum specimens collected over the past 100 yr from 30 locations in the Caribbean. The relative demipyramid lengths from the museum specimens were also compared over time, and with human population density, human fishing pressure, and geographic region. The results indicate that relative demipyramid size is indirectly influenced by human activity and varies with geographic region. This suggests that human fishing pressure has influenced Caribbean coral reef community structure by affecting predator-herbivore relationships. However, this human impact may be small relative to naturally occurring variation in demipyramid size.

AB Acidification effects on zooplankton community structure are examined within the context of a model proposed by Menge and Sutherland, which was originally developed from studies of the effects of physical disturbance on marine intertidal zone communities. The model proposes that with increasing environmental stress, the factors predation, competition, and physical or physiological disturbance each predominate in turn in structuring food webs. Analyses of zooplankton communities along pH gradients do not support the Menge and Sutherland model. Patterns of species richness relationships with pH follow the general predictions of Menge and Sutherland (highest diversity at intermediate stress) in data from only 3 of 10 different studies that I examined. Predation and competition links in zooplankton food webs in acidified lakes near Sudbury, Ontario, maintain a constant ratio with acidification to pH 5.0, but at higher hydrogen ion concentrations food webs become highly variable.

AB In Carpinteria Salt Marsh, Salicornia virginica (pickleweed) grows at lower marsh elevations than does Arthrocnemum subterminalis (Parish's glasswort).  Standing biomass of both species was greatest immediately adjacent to their abrupt border, suggesting that conditions for plant growth were best here.  We utilized field experiments, in which growth rates of naturally occurring and transplanted individuals of both species were measured in four marsh zones, to investigate the role of edaphic factors and competition in maintaining this zonation pattern.
   The frequency of flooding, and hence soil waterlogging, was greatest at lower marsh elevations, whereas salinity was highest at higher marsh elevations.  Consequently, it was not clear, a priori, which part of the marsh had the most severe physical conditions.  In our field experiments, both Salicornia and Arthrocnemum grew better in the two middle marsh zones (high Salicornia zone and Arthrocnemum zone) than in either the low marsh (low Salicornia zone), where flooding was frequent and soils were waterlogged, or the high marsh (transition zone), where soil salinity was extremely high during much of the year and plant water potentials very low.  However, Salicornia appeared better able to tolerate flooding, and so persisted in the low Salicornia zone, whereas Arthrocnemum appeared better able to tolerate high salinities, and so persisted in the transition zone.  Interspecific competition was most important in the relatively benign middle marsh zones, where each species excluded the other from a portion of this prime habitat.
   In this marsh, flooding, soil salinity, and competition all interacted to determine plant zonation patterns, but the relative importance of these factors varied at different elevations.

AB We studied avian breeding and molting activity in relation to rainfall, temporal fluctuations in food resource abundance, and food exploitation by birds, in four arid and semiarid tropical habitats in Venezuela. Twice a month we used mist nets to monitor changes in breeding and molting conditions of captured birds and forced them to regurgitate to determine their diet and feeding guild membership. Food abundance was assessed by measuring the flowering and fruiting seasonality of marked plants and by evaluating arthropod abundance with four different trapping methods. Flowering activity was limited largely to the wet season. Fleshy fruits, although produced year-round, were also more abundant in the rainy period. Arthropod abundance followed the same general pattern with numbers highest in the wet season and lowest in the dry season. Birds of all feeding guilds predominantly bred and molted during the wet season, synchronously with the highest abundance of most food resources. However, the diet analysis revealed a higher occurrence of arthropods coupled with a sharp decrease in the intake of vegetable matter during the birds' breeding season. Consequently, we suggest that arthropod abundance is a crucial factor governing the timing of breeding activities, even in species that normally include a high proportion of nectar and fruits in their diet. We also postulate that, in tropical habitats receiving > 1500 mm of rain per year, breeding in nectarivores and frugivores in the dry season may be related to the lower reduction in arthropod numbers over the less severe drought period.

AB In Lamto savanna (Cote d'Ivoire), grass delta-N-15 (almost-equal-to -1.3 parts per thousand) is much lower (has a smaller absolute value) than soil organic matter delta-N-15 (almost-equal-to +5 parts per thousand).  In order to understand such a discrepancy, we have analyzed N-15 natural concentrations in the four major sources of mineral nitrogen that can meet the annual requirements of plants:  bulk precipitation, mineralization of humified soil organic matter, atmospheric dinitrogen fixation, and decomposition of plant litter.  The first source (negative delta-N-15) only contributes almost-equal-to 7% of nitrogen requirements, as does the second (delta-N-15 almost-equal-to +7 parts per thousand) due to a very low humus mineralization rate.  The third source (delta-N-15 = 0) contributes up to 17%, due to nonsymbiotic N2 fixation by microorganisms associated with grasses, legumes being almost absent from the savanna.  All these processes cannot account for the low delta-N-15 of grasses, suggesting that most of the assimilated nitrogen originates from the decay of root material (delta-N-15 almost-equal-to -1.1 parts per thousand).

AB I derived predictions about how the magnitude of Daphnia effects on total phytoplankton biomass should vary across a gradient of enrichment (expressed as algal carrying capacity) using two, simple predator-prey models.  These predictions were then compared with data from a survey of field experiments in temperate lakes.  Algal responses to Daphnia manipulation were quantified as an Algal Response Factor (ARF), defined as total algal biomass in the low-Daphnia treatment divided by total algal biomass in the high-Daphnia treatment.  Total phosphorus concentration (TP) was used as an index of algal carrying capacity, ranging from 10 to 460-mu-g/L over the 22 experiments surveyed.  The Algal Response Factor ranged from 1 to 40 and was a positive, linear function of TP:  ARF = -0.14 + 0.08(TP), r2 = 0.81; log ARF = -0.81 + 0.83(log TP), r2 = 0.75.  Thus, algal carrying capacity, as quantified by TP, explains much of the variation in Daphnia effects on total algal biomass across lakes.
   The survey results supported the prediction of the simpler model, a two-species, Lotka-Volterra model of pure exploitation.  Incorporating the additional complexity of inedible algae into this model did little to improve its predictive power.  The conclusion that inedible algae are not of major importance to the prediction of Daphnia effects across an enrichment gradient was supported by a survey of Daphnia effects on the proportionate biomass of inedible algae.  There was no evidence that Daphnia grazing typically favors dominance by inedible algae at equilibrium in highly enriched lakes.
   My results suggest that the well-established positive relationship between TP and equilibrium algal biomass in lakes is more likely to be a consequence of increases in Daphnia's death rate with enrichment, rather than decreases in Daphnia's feeding and assimilation rates.  When zooplanktivorous fish are rare, Daphnia should be able to prevent phytoplankton biomass from responding to nutrient addition at equilibrium.  As a consequence, the success of biomanipulation in eutrophic lakes should critically depend upon the effectiveness of strategies aimed at reducing zooplanktivory.

AB Many yeasts in the genus Pichia are killers (yeasts that secrete proteins toxic to other yeasts). The genus is subdivided into complexes comprised of species with similar morphologies, physiological abilities, and percentage of (guanine + cytosine) comprising their nuclear DNA. Here, we test the hypothesis that ecological factors influence the types of toxins produced by members of two Pichia complexes (the Pichia kluyveri and Pichia opuntiae complexes). Members of each complex are separated by geography or host range, but all live in decaying cactus tissue.
   Similarities among killer toxins were investigated by testing strains from each complex in the laboratory for their ability to kill a standard set of 70 yeasts. Principal components analysis demonstrated that the killer phenotype was constant within a species, but not within the complexes. The probability that a toxin would kill a particular yeast depended on some ecological characteristic of the yeasts tested as sensitives (i.e., the region, host plant, or habitat from which the yeasts were collected).
   We further tested the hypothesis that ecological factors influence killer phenotype by analyzing within-community patterns of killing. Killer strains from two different cacti were tested for their ability to kill a subset of the yeasts actually collected from the same pockets of rotting cactus tissue from which the killer strains were collected or from rot pockets in neighboring cacti. When the yeasts tested for sensitivity were classified a priori by their probability of interacting with each killer strain, it was shown that the sensitivity to killer toxin was correlated with the probability of interaction. Further, the yeast community composition of a rot pocket depended on the presence or absence of a killer strain in that pocket.
   We demonstrated that killer toxins could change community composition by growing strains of two sensitive yeasts in the presence of a killer or a non-killer strain of P. kluyveri. The killer strain reached a higher cell density than the non-killer strain in the presence of sensitive yeasts. The density of sensitive yeasts grown with a killer strain was lower than that of a strain grown with a non-killer strain of P. kluyveri.

AB We measured the timing and magnitude of nitrogenase activity and N2 fixation by lupines colonizing early successional volcanic sites at Mount St. Helens. Nitrogenase activity (measured by acetylene reduction) in Lupinus lepidus growing at a pyroclastic site exhibited significant diurnal trends, with lowest ethylene evolution rates at night. Nitrogenase activity also followed seasonal trends, with high rates in June, very low levels in August, the dry warm part of the season, and a partial recovery of nitrogenase activity in September after precipitation resumed. A comparison of typical nitrogenase activities measured at several sites suggested that rates of N2 fixation were highest in L. lepidus growing at disturbed low N sites. Adult lupine C and N composition also varied during the growing season, with trends correlated with seasonal patterns of nitrogenase activity.
   Seasonal N2 fixation in L. lepidus and L. latifolius was measured using N-15 isotope. Both species fixed almost-equal-to 60% of their N during the first season of growth with some evidence of preferential allocation to aboveground biomass. N fixation by Lupinus lepidus individuals was almost-equal-to 18.1 mg/g biomass or an average of 15.4 mg per plant, while L. latifolius fixed an average of 16.3 mg/g biomass, equivalent to 22.9 mg per plant. Average net C fixation during the same period was 355 and 589 mg per plant for L. lepidus and L. latifolius, respectively. Despite these rates, the current distribution of L. lepidus into a few, small patches that occupy < 1% of the surface area indicates that annual N inputs by lupines are < 0.05 kg/ha and thus probably-not the primary source of N input into developing Mount St. Helens pyroclastic sites except at a local scale.

AB Since habitats are generally spatially heterogeneous, an important component of niche variation may be determined by the relationship between individual variation in feeding among and within habitats. We characterized variation in diet among and within individual tiger salamander larvae (Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum) among and within sites in natural ponds. We also analyzed prey variation among sites. There was significant variation in diet among sites, controlling for variation in larval size among sites. Prey taxa varied significantly among sites. There were also significant size-associated differences in diet within sites. Controlling for larval size we found no further evidence of significant interindividual differences in diet within sites. Intrapopulation variation in diet among sites is likely a consequence of adaptive phenotypic plasticity in feeding behavior of individuals on a spatially variable prey assemblage. This result supports Van Valen's hypothesis that selection should favor multiple phenotypes within populations. Variation in diet among sites is directly analogous to the within- and between-phenotype components of niche variation defined by Roughgarden. Size-associated differences in diet represent a significant ontogenetic component to niche variation in feeding within populations of larval salamanders.
   Studies of food web structure that ignore predator diet and prey differences among sites are an incomplete summary of predator-prey linkages. In addition, phenotypic plasticity in feeding behavior as a source of niche variation has implications for traditional ecological theory of intra- and interspecific interactions, which has rarely included variation other than morphological size differences among animals.

AB Biologically derived safe sites appear to strongly affect spatial and temporal patterns in terrestrial plant communities; however, few experimental field studies have been conducted to investigate the importance of such interactions or the mechanisms by which they operate. Quercus douglasii and Quercus lobata are winter-deciduous oaks endemic to California. I examined associations between seedlings of these oaks and several species of shrubs and conducted field experiments that tested for facilitative effects of two shrubs, Salvia leucophylla and Artemisia californica, on seedling survival. Naturally occurring Q. douglasii seedlings were relatively common (280 seedlings/ha) and were strongly associated with shrub canopies. In two experimental plantings, 30% and 55% of Q. douglasii seedlings that emerged under shrubs survived for > 1 yr, whereas no seedling in the open survived in either experiment. Survival of Q. douglasii where shrubs were removed was similar to survival in the open grassland, indicating that association between shrubs and oak seedlings was not due to shared microsite requirements. Q. douglasii seedling survival was not different between the two shrub species. Only three Q. lobata seedlings were found in 26 study plots, although reproductive adults were present. The seedlings were under shrub canopies. However, the survival of Q. lobata was not facilitated by shrub cover or shrub simulation and no other evidence was found for nurse-shrub interactions with this oak species.
   Artificial shade was critical to the survival of Q. douglasii seedlings in simulated shrub environments. When grown in artificial shade, photosynthetic capacities and root elongation rates of Q. douglasii seedlings were significantly higher than those of Q. lobata. These differences may partially explain why nurse-plant interactions exist between shrubs and Q. douglasii seedlings but not between the same shrubs and Q. lobata seedlings. Causes of acorn and seedling mortality differed between the shrub and open grassland habitats. Under shrubs, acorn predation was the primary cause of mortality, whereas mortality due to shoot herbivory was much more frequent in the open grassland. Thus, propagules under shrubs that avoided predation until shoot emergence benefitted from canopy shade and protection from herbivores.
   The shade tolerance and nurse-plant utilization of Q. douglasii seedlings have parallels with shade tolerance and late successional roles of other oak species in temperate deciduous forests, and, as in these forests, may affect the long-term spatial dynamics in California woodlands.

AB I tested the hypothesis that phytophagous insect species compete interspecifically on shared host plants by inducing chemical, physical, and phenological changes in the plant that either directly reduce insect growth and survival or indirectly alter attack by natural enemies. I manipulated levels of simulated folivory on branches within eight trees of Quercus emoryi in a complete randomized block design. Survival and causes of mortality, including attack by natural enemies, of a dominant leafminer, Cameraria sp. nov., were monitored over two growing seasons.
   Survival varied significantly among trees but not among treatments. Causes of mortality also varied significantly among trees. Death from premature leaf abscission increased significantly with increasing levels of branch damage, while mortality from other causes, including death from bacterial and fungal attack, declined significantly with increasing levels of damage. However, neither of these changes in mortality was sufficient to cause changes in overall survival. Leaf damage did not influence attack by macroscopic natural enemies (hymenopteran parasitoids or vertebrate and invertebrate predators). By far, the most important factor affecting survival and causes of mortality within trees was the presence of co-occurring larvae on leaves (i.e., intraspecific competition).
   Simulated folivory in the first growing season did not affect folivory by Cameraria or other folivorous arthropods in the next season. Colonization, survival, rate of attack by natural enemies, and amount of herbivory by other arthropods in the second growing season were not affected by levels of leaf damage in the first one. Neither survival nor causes of mortality of Cameraria in the second growing season were associated with folivory by endemic leafchewing arthropods. Simulated folivory in the first growing season did, however, reduce leaf production in the second season.
   These results do not support the hypothesis that insect species compete interspecifically via induced plant responses and their effects on the third trophic level (natural enemies of the herbivores). The effects of simulated (first growing season) and insect (second growing season) folivory via induced plant responses on the Cameraria population was negligible relative to intraspecific interactions. Further, my results do not support the notion that folivore-induced responses are defensive and that plants have evolved these responses to manipulate the third trophic level. In natural settings, other factors that influence population dynamics of phytophagous insects, such as intraspecific competition and interactions with microparasites, may obscure any negative effects of herbivore-induced plant responses on interactions among herbivore species and their macroscopic natural enemies.

AB Investigations on fruit and fruiting characteristics of animal-dispersed, fleshy-fruited plants have been generally interpreted in terms of adaptations by plants to dispersal agents. Most often, these studies did not formulate non-adaptive, alternative null hypotheses, and the potential influence of phylogenetic effects on observed patterns was not assessed either. This paper presents an analysis of interspecific variation in fruit shape (as assessed by length and width) among vertebrate-dispersed plants of the Iberian Peninsula. Tests of predictions from both adaptive (to dispersal agents) and null (based on allometry) hypotheses are presented and the influence of phylogenetic effects is also accounted for. Interspecific variation in fruit shape was unrelated to seed dispersal mode ("bird dispersed" vs. "bird plus mammal dispersed"), and predictions from adaptive hypotheses were not supported. Variation in fruit shape did not depart significantly from that predicted by the allometry-based, null hypothesis. Deviations of individual species from the predicted allometric relationship were unrelated to dispersal mode, and originated from genus- and species-specific variation in fruit shape. There exists a considerable influence of phylogeny on fruit shape variation, and nearly half of total variance is attributable to variation among genera within families. After accounting for phylogenetic effects, the null hypothesis still held within taxonomic categories above the species level. Observed constancy in the relative variation of fruit length and width, despite variation in dispersal mode and morphological type, is interpreted in terms of shared morphogenetic and physical constraints independent of dispersal. The implications of substantial phylogenetic effects on interspecific patterns of variation in fruit and fruiting traits are discussed.

AB At Finca La Selva, in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica, the Long-tailed Hermit (Phaethornis superciliosus) has a long breeding season (December or January through August or September) during which flowers are abundant, followed by a severe but predictable season of flower scarcity in late October-November, during which most of the annual mortality normally occurs. In 1973, the third of a 4-yr population study of marked lek males, an unusual drought caused a severe flower shortage at the height of the breeding season. During the latter part of the breeding season lek activity of males was reduced, successful breeding by females was drastically curtailed, and masses of both sexes dropped to levels lower than those of the lean season. Interrupted molt, an indicator of energy stress normally seen only in a minority of breeding females, was observed in 25% of adult males, and 50% of females, in 1973. Survivorship of lek males through the breeding season dropped from 90% in normal years to almost-equal-to 60%, and the total lek population at the start of the 1974 breeding season was one-third lower than before the drought in 1973; the cohort of yearling males was most strongly affected. Recovery of numbers and age structure of the lek male population to pre-1973 levels required 3-4 yr. Jolly-Seber analyses showed close agreement with survivorship as determined by direct observation (possible because of the lek social system), and permitted estimation of other parameters of interest: populations of marked and unmarked males, probability of recapture of marked males, and recruitment. The average annual survivorship of male P. superciliosus (in normal years) is near the mean value reported for a series of tropical species. A simple model of the reproductive output of female P. superciliosus, assuming no sexual differences in survivorship, suggests that a female breeding only in the prime breeding season (roughly February-July, when over 80% of the fledglings are normally produced) will no more than replace herself in the population; breeding throughout 8-9 mo will permit her to increase her reproductive output by up to 10%, which agrees well with the 3+ yr required by the (male) population to recover from the drought. Possible implications of these findings for tropical bird demography and conservation are discussed.

AB A method is proposed to partition the variation of species abundance data into independent components: pure spatial, pure environmental, spatial component of environmental influence, and undetermined. The new method uses pre-existing techniques and computer programs of canonical ordination. The intrinsic spatial component of community structure is partialled out of the species-environment relationship in order to see if the environmental control model still holds. The method is illustrated using oribatid mites in a peat blanket, forest vegetation data, and aquatic heterotrophic bacteria. In this latter example, the new method is shown to be complementary to another approach based on partial Mantel tests.

AB The production, development, and mortality of fine roots in a northern hardwood forest was monitored for 1 yr using minirhizotrons. Roots were divided into two strata based upon their depth in the soil, < 30 cm and > 30 cm. Cohort analyses of roots produced in the spring of 1989 revealed that while almost 50% of fine roots at both depths survived after 346 d, the number of white roots in each cohort declined very rapidly. Virtually all roots had turned brown after 346 d. The probability of a surviving white root turning brown was much greater than the probability that it would die at all times of the year, and the bulk of root mortality was accounted for by brown roots. Analysis of root length production and mortality showed that total annual length mortality at the < 30 cm depth was 76% of the initial standing crop and 110% at > 30 cm depth. Fine root production and mortality occurred simultaneously throughout the year, and production was slightly greater than mortality at both depths. Total root length peaked in the summer at both depths, and overwinter production and mortality was rather low. Production of white and brown root length indicated that roots near the soil surface were undergoing much more rapid rates of browning than deep roots. Loss of root length between sampling dates was largely due to roots that died and rapidly decayed or otherwise disappeared.

AB Large plots of native shortgrass steppe were labeled with C-14 to assess short-term patterns of carbon allocation and the long-term process of herbivory, death, and decomposition, and to compare estimates of net aboveground, crown, and root primary production using C-14 dilution, C-14 turnover, and traditional harvest methods.
   Stabilization of labile C-14 via translocation, incorporation into structural tissue, and respiration and exudation required one growing season.  Exudation was 17% of plant C-14 after stabilization.  Estimates of turnover time for leaves, crowns, and roots by C-14 turnover were 3, 5, and 8 yr, respectively, yielding estimates of belowground production that were much lower than previously thought.  Estimates of aboveground production by C-14 turnover were close to those obtained by harvest of peak-standing crop, but lower than reported values obtained by harvest maxima-minima.  Estimates of root production by harvest maxima-minima were zero in 2 of 4 yr.  C-14 turnover appeared to provide reliable estimates of aboveground, crown, and root production.  In contrast to reliable estimates by C-14 turnover, C-14 dilution estimates of root production were anomalous.  The anomalous estimates were attributed to a nonuniform labeling of tissue age classes resulting in differential decompostion/herbivory of C-14:  C-12 through time, as well as movement and loss of labile C-14 through the first growing season.  Isotope-dilution methodologies may be unreliable for any estimate of pool turnover when the labeling period is not as long as pool-turnover time.
   Problems and biases associated with traditional harvest maxima-minima methods of estimating aboveground primary production are well known, but are greatly exacerbated when the method is used to estimate root production.  Estimates of root production by C-14 dilution were unrealistic.  C-14 turnover methodology provided reliable estimates of production in this community.

AB Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) produces winged seeds typical of many wind-dispersed pines.  However, seedlings often occur in clumps, suggesting that many seeds are scatter-hoarded by animals.  An experiment is described that examines how the initially wind-dispersed seeds end up in animal caches.  Two arrays of 1064 Jeffrey pine seeds were arranged around two "source" trees in a pattern predicted from models of wind dispersal.  Seeds were labeled with radioactive scandium-46 and numbered 1-12 with indelible ink to represent the 12 1-m wide annuli centered on the source tree where they were deployed.  Within 2 d, between 95 and 99% of the seeds had been removed by rodents.  Fifty-four and 35% of the seeds were found stored at the two sites, most of these in shallow surface caches.  Seed caches were located 1.3-54.2 m and 6.2-62.9 m from the "source" trees at sites one and two, respectively.  Mean distance of the "wind-dispersed" seeds from the source tree was 4.6 m, and rodents moved seeds a mean of 13.0 m farther at site 1 and 24.7 m farther at site 2.  Of 375 minimum dispersal measurements, seeds were carried away from the source tree 362 times.  Four rodent species may have participated in caching the seeds, but yellow pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus) appeared to be the species that cached most of the seeds.  In a second experiment where rodents were excluded, seeds placed on the soil surface in fall rarely became buried during the winter, and if not buried, they would not germinate.  Jeffrey pine seeds appear to be dispersed in two phases; seeds are initially scattered by the wind, and subsequently carried farther and cached in soil by animals.

AB Our objectives were to determine if the mutualistic effect of ant tending on aphid population growth varied with aphid density, and to consider possible mechanisms explaining such a context-dependent effect. We studied the interaction between Aphis varians and Formica cinerea on fireweed(Epilobium angustifolium) in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. In 1988 we used two experiments to examine the interaction between ant tending and aphid density on the per capita growth of aphid populations at naturally occurring low aphid densities, and naturally occurring high aphid densities. In 1989, we conducted a similar experiment, but we manipulated aphid densities to include the full range from low to high. The results of these experiments were consistent: ant tending significantly improved the growth of small aphid populations, but the benefit from ant tending decreased or disappeared at higher aphid densities. We considered possible mechanisms for the density-dependent mutualistic effect by examining the relationships among aphid density, the number of ants tending, and predator abundance. We show that the relative number of ants tending declined as aphid density increased, and ant tending did not reduce predator abundance at any aphid densities. Therefore, the cause of the density-dependent mutualism is probably a decline in the direct effect of ants on aphids resulting from a decline in the relative number of ants tending aphids at higher aphid densities. We discuss the implications of density-dependent mutualism for the dynamics and evolution of mutualistic systems.

AB Few studies have directly addressed the effects of disturbance on spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Spatial heterogeneity is the degree of dissimilarity in species composition from one point to another in a community, whereas temporal heterogeneity is compositional change within a site over time. The purposes of this study were to determine (1) if a quadratic relationship exists between within-site heterogeneity and disturbance frequency as predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH), (2) if disturbed and undisturbed sites have similar heterogeneity as implied by the disturbance heterogeneity hypothesis (DHM), and whether or not these results differed with scale, and (3) if there is a relationship between spatial and temporal heterogeneity as implied by the DHM. Analyses were based on plant species composition data collected over 9 yr in quadrats permanently located in experimental management units subjected to different burning frequencies at Konza Prairie Research Natural Area, Kansas, USA.
   The relationship between disturbance frequency and within-site heterogeneity was opposite that predicted by the IDH. Heterogeneity was lowest at intermediate disturbance frequencies. Heterogeneity in annually burned prairie was lower than in unburned prairie and prairies burned once every 4 yr in contrast to predictions of the DHM. However, this relationship did not hold at larger spatial scales. There was a positive relationship between within-site spatial and temporal heterogeneity on annually burned sites, sites burned once every 4 yr, and nearly so on sites burned every other year. Within-site heterogeneity was negatively correlated with cover of Andropogon gerardii, and positively correlated with total richness and species diversity. Studies of variation, in addition to averages, will increase our ability to predict patterns of species distribution and abundance within and between communities in response to disturbance.

AB Predictive models relating species richness of rare plants to measured habitat variables were developed using data from the shoreline vegetation of lakes in southwestern Nova Scotia. These lakes contain large disjunct populations of many Atlantic Coastal Plain plant species whose main ranges are along the eastern seaboard of the United States. The richness of rare coastal plain herbs was easier to predict than richness of the "background flora" of wide-ranging species from noncoastal plain elements. Multiple-regression models using habitat variables accounted for 83% of the variability in species richness of rare coastal plain species but only 45% of that for the background flora. Richness was best correlated with the two inter-related variables, watershed area and shoreline width. The mechanism underlying this pattern appears to be that flooding kills woody plants, thereby reducing competition from shrubs and creating open expanses of shoreline.

AB Wing morphology and echolocation call design have been used to make predictions regarding habitat-use and resource partitioning in insectivorous bats.  Species with very different morphologies and/or calls forage in different habitats or in different ways.  However, bat communities contain many morphologically similar species, which would be predicted to overlap ecologically.  We tested the reliability of such predictions and assumptions by investigating the habitat use and diet of two similar species, the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) and the long-legged bat (Myotis volans), in southern Alberta, Canada.  We recorded the echolocation calls of free-flying individuals and measured wing morphology.
   The echolocation calls of the two species overlapped in design, although on average the calls of M. volans were shorter and had higher maximum frequency than those of M. lucifugus.  Both species had low wing loading and aspect ratio although M. lucifugus had significantly higher values than did M. volans and was thus expected to forage in areas with less environmental clutter.  Field observations did not substantiate this, however,
   We assessed the foraging ecology of the bats by:  (1) monitoring species-specific echolocation calls of free-flying individuals, (2) capturing bats in mist-nets set in various habitats, (3) observing the foraging behavior of light-tagged individuals, and (4) assessing the diet from fecal samples.  There was no evidence of temporal partitioning of resources by the two species, but some spatial partitioning occurred.  Although individuals of both species generally fed in open areas, M. lucifugus foraged primarily low over water while M. volans fed high above the ground and along cliff edges.  Neither fed consistently in cluttered areas despite wing and echolocation call designs that should permit such behavior.  Despite the overlap in foraging areas, the diets of the two species differed significantly.  Myotis volans ate primarily lepidopterans while M. lucifugus ate a wider variety of prey, including dipterans, lepidopterans, and coleopterans.
   Our results suggest that there are several levels at which morphology influences the ecology of insectivorous bats.  Large differences may influence foraging-habitat choice by restricting some species to certain habitats.  At another level, however, we suggest that small differences influence prey availability rather than habitat availability.  Bats may select habitats based on the distribution of suitable prey rather than due to direct limitations imposed by morphology or echolocation call design.

AB This laboratory study of Daphnia magna had two major aims: (1) to examine the effect of food quantity on offspring size and number and how this effect varies with genotype and maternal size, age, and metabolic demand; and (2) to examine the relationship of investment per offspring to total reproductive investment. Differences in the response of offspring size to food quantity between the two clones in this study and between Daphnia studies in the literature are explained by a nonlinear model that explicitly considers the effect of food quantity relative to the metabolic demands of the mother. According to this model, offspring size covaries positively with food quantity/maternal demand at very low food levels because of reproductive constraints, but it covaries negatively with food quantity/maternal demand at middle food levels as an adaptive response, and it remains constant at very high food levels because of a lower limit on viable offspring size.
   Effects of genotype (clone) and ration level on trade-offs between egg size and number and on the maternal size-dependence of egg mass, brood mass, and brood size are described. Strong genotype-environment interactions are evident for egg size and number. Trade-offs between egg size and number are seen at high and low ration levels, but only in second (or third) to sixth broods, and not in first broods, which had relatively high variation in total mass. Results of this study that contradict predictions or assumptions of optimal offspring investment theory include: (1) at both ration levels both egg size and number were strongly positively correlated with brood mass, independently of maternal mass, (2) although, at low ration, variability of brood mass usually exceeded the variability of egg mass, as expected, the opposite was true at high ration, and (3) the interclonal difference in offspring size was not correlated with survival ability under starvation.
   Offspring size covaried positively with maternal size and age, partly independently of culture conditions. This relationship is explained as the result of selection in growing parthenogenetic populations for increased fecundity in young small females, which are constrained to produce relatively small eggs because of spatial limitations of the brood pouch.

AB This study investigates the responses of house mice (Mus domesticus) to two species of introduced mammalian predators in Western Australia, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and cat (Felis catus), and to an endemic carnivorous marsupial, the western quoll (Dasyurus geoffroii). In four study areas containing no mammalian predators, mice showed little discrimination between traps bearing fecal odors of the predators and traps bearing conspecific odors or no odor. Mice in these areas also used sites of different vegetation density roughly in proportion to their abundance, irrespective of the intensity of lunar illumination or whether densities of predator feces were high or low. These results suggest that predator-naive mice do not respond to predator odors or to different levels of predation risk. In contrast, mice in 12 other study areas containing one to three species of mammalian predators avoided traps with predator odors, and generally selected relatively dense vegetation. They also used sites of greater vegetation density on moonlit compared to dark nights, and in two study areas where the density of cat feces had been experimentally increased. These results indicate that mice in areas exposed to mammalian predators distinguish predator odors and use denser vegetation when the perceived risk of predation is increased.
   In further experiments, I introduced predator-naive and predator-experienced mice to study areas containing cats and foxes. Survival rates of experienced mice a month after release were 2 1/2 times higher than those of their naive counterparts, and hence support the hypothesis that a habitat shift to dense vegetation is an effective anti-predator response.

AB A field experiment was conducted to examine the relative importance of soil factors and plant species on communities of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi. Populations of VAM fungal spores were studied in 4-yr-old monocultures of five successional grass species grown in a gradient of soil mixtures ranging from pure subsurface sand to pure sandy loam topsoil. A total of 19 species of VAM fungi were found across all treatments. Of the 12 most abundant VAM fungal species, 6 species had a significant dependence on both soil mixture and host species, while 2 were dependent only on soil and 2 only on host. To our knowledge, these are the first results indicating that even closely related hosts (five grasses) may cause divergence in VAM fungal communities on initially identical soils. Cluster analysis of the similarity of fungal communities by host plant species showed the fungal communities in the two late successional grasses to be most similar to one another and least similar to the fungal communities in the early successional grass species. Cluster analysis of the similarity of fungal communities by soil mixture showed the fungal communities in the sandy end of the soil gradient diverged predictably from the fungal communities in the black soil end of the gradient. These results support the hypothesis that soil factors and plant species may be of equal importance in regulating the species composition of VAM fungal communities.

AB Some planktonic cyanobacteria possess chemical defenses (toxins) or morphological defenses (filamentous morphology) against herbivory by zooplankton; Anabaena affinis is both toxic and filamentous. The presence of A. affinis has a differential effect on various zooplankton taxa, causing reductions in the population growth rates of large cladocerans but not of small cladocerans or rotifers. Here, we investigate the importance of differences in zooplankton foraging patterns in determining the differential inhibitory effect of A. affinis. Radiotracer feeding experiments were conducted on four cladoceran species (5 clones, and 15 body sizes), two rotifer species, and one calanoid copepod species. With one exception (the cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia), the ingestion rates of zooplankton on unicellular phytoplankton (Cryptomonas) were not reduced by the presence of A. affinis. Behavioral observations showed that cladocerans sometimes rejected A. affinis filaments, but did not simultaneously reject Cryptomonas cells. Thus, the differential inhibitory effect of A. affinis is not caused by mechanical interference with feeding. When offered Cryptomonas and A. affinis simultaneously, small cladocerans, rotifers, and the copepod fed more selectively than large cladocerans and avoided ingesting toxic filaments. As a result, large cladocerans received higher mass-specific doses of the toxin. Different tendencies to ingest toxic filaments, perhaps combined with different physiological sensitivities to the toxin, cause the differential effect of A. affinis on various zooplankton taxa. This variation in herbivore response to cyanobacterial defenses may change the species composition and size structure of zooplankton communities.

ID AFFINITY ANALYSIS; MODEL
AB In this paper I develop a new viewpoint with regard to species diversity by defining a new type, pattern diversity, to add to the previous categories of inventory and differentiation diversity. By defining and naming this entity, we expand our notions of the properties of ecological units, can integrate it with other ecological concepts, and investigate it. Pattern diversity is a measure of the relative arrangement of subunits within an ecological unit, such as communities in a landscape. In tum, pattern diversity has three types: spatial, temporal, and compositional. Compositional pattern diversity is measured as mosaic diversity using a method called affinity analysis. Mosaic diversity measures landscape complexity and is a function of two properties of species patterns: the variation in species richness among communities and the variation in commonness or rarity among species (evenness). A low value of mosaic diversity is indicative of a simple landscape with one or a few underlying environmental gradients and dominated by a few species; a high value is indicative of a complex landscape with many environmental gradients and no ubiquitous species. Statistical inference can be used for determining standard errors and for comparing with null models. Mosaic diversity is relatively insensitive to the number of sites sampled, the number of species sampled, and the intensity of sampling of rare species. Thus, pattern diversity and its measure-mosaic diversity-hold out promise to provide a new perspective on species diversity and the rules governing the assemblage of communities.

AB Hundreds of kilometres of West Tennessee streams have been channelized since the turn of the century.  After a stream is straightened, dredged, or cleared, basin-wide ecologic, hydrologic, and geomorphic processes bring about an integrated, characteristic recovery sequence.  The rapid pace of channel responses to channelization provides an opportunity to document and interpret vegetation recovery patterns relative to otherwise long-term, concomitant evolution of river geomorphology.  Nearly 150 sites along 15 streams were studied in the Obion, Forked Deer, Hatchie, and Wolf River basins.  Channels of these streams, except that of the Hatchie River main stem, have undergone major modifications along all or parts of their courses.  This paper presents the eco-geomorphic analyses and interpretation of a large multidisciplinary study, with special reference to the interrelated hydrogeomorphic aspects of channel recovery.  Quantitative plant ecological analyses were conducted to infer relative bank stability, to identify indicator recovery species, and to determine patterns of vegetation development through the course of accelerated channel evolution.  Binary-discriminant and ordination analyses show that distinctive riparian-species patterns reflect a six-stage model of channel evolution and can be used to infer channel stability and hydrogeomorphic conditions.  Woody vegetation initially establishes on low- and mid-bank surfaces at the same location and time that bank accretion begins, and corresponds to the site of initial geomorphic restabilization.  The linkage of channel bed aggradation, woody vegetation establishment, and bank accretion all lead to recovery of the channel.  Pioneer species are hardy and fast growing, and can tolerate moderate amounts of slope instability and sediment deposition; these species include river birch (Betula nigra), black willow (Salix nigra), boxelder (Acer negundo), and silver maple (Acer saccharinum).  High stem densities and root-mass development appear to enhance bank stability.  Tree-ring analyses suggest that on average 65 yr may be required for recovery after channelization.

AB We addressed several controversial issues regarding the impact of predatory fish on prey in natural streams in Kentucky by experimentally adding predatory green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus, to four stream pools that contained small-mouthed salamander larvae, Ambystoma barbouri, while leaving four other pools as fishless controls.  We monitored the density, drift (in and out of pools), and habitat use of the larvae before and for 1 mo after fish addition (until larvae began to undergo metamorphosis).  By quantifying larval density and drift, we were able to address two issues:  (1) effect of prey exchange on predator impacts; and (2) relative contribution to total predator impact of predation per se vs. predator-induced emigration.
   Larval densities and behaviors were similar in experimental and control pools before fish addition.  After fish addition:  (1) density decreased more rapidly in fish pools than in control pools; (2) larvae in fish pools spent more time under rocks and less time in deep, central areas than did larvae in control pools; and (3) larval overnight drift rates (proportion of larval in a pool, drifting out overnight) were higher in fish pools than in control pools.
   We calculated weekly average rates of change in larval density in fish and control pools and found that densities in control pools decreased very little except during a period with flooding; that is, flooding was a major cause of population reduction in fishless pools.  In contrast, in fish pools, densities decreased steadily.  Interestingly, the rate of decrease in larval density in fish pools was lower during the flood period than during other periods.  This might be due to an increase in net drift into fish pools, or a decrease in fish predation during floods.
   Although net drift (drift in minus drift out) showed a tendency to be positive, it did not differ significantly from zero in any situation (fish or control pools, day or night).  In particular, fish-induced increases in larval per capita emigration rates offset high immigration rates into fish pools.  Because there was no significant net drift into fish pools, immigration could not swamp predator impacts.  Because there was no significant net drift out of fish pools, the decrease in larval density in fish pools can be explained entirely by predation per se, rather than by predator-induced emigration.
   Our data suggested that, in the experiment year, almost-equal-to 30-40% of all larvae in this population drifted through a fish pool at some time in their lives; this estimate is conservative because we were unable to get data on drift rates during floods.  On average, only almost-equal-to 6-8% of the larvae that drifted into a fish pool survived to drift out the downstream end.  Thus fish predation should be a strong selective agent favoring behaviors that enhance larval survivorship and drift out of fish pools.
   Auxiliary experiments showed that:  (1) larvae decrease their activity when they first drift into fish pools; this presumably decreases the conspicuousness of these larvae to visual predators; (2) the presence of fish is associated with a larval shift in diurnal activity towards greater activity at night rather than in the daytime; this is associated with drift out at night; and (3) larvae alter their refuge use and drift in response to caged fish, from which larvae probably only receive chemical cues.
   Overall, our study is one of the few to simultaneously monitor predator effects on prey population dynamics, dispersal, and refuge use.  Information on each of these variables helped us to better understand predator effects on the other variables; we suggest that it should be generally useful to monitor a relatively full set of prey responses to predators.

AB The environmental changes associated with a fire-induced shift from old-growth lichen-spruce krummholz to lichen-tundra vegetation have been evaluated at a tree line site in northern Quebec. Tree ring and growth form patterns of black spruce (Picea mariana) remains lying on the ground in a lichen-tundra community were used to reconstruct, within a 4600-m2 quadrat, the structure of a conifer stand at the time of the bum (approximately AD 1750). The prefire spruces were the last members of a long regenerative sequence leading to maintenance of a lichen-spruce stand formed after a bum approximately 1700 yr BP. At this time postfire recruitment was most likely facilitated by favorable climatic conditions. Before the 1750 fire event the krummholz was predominantly maintained by layering, due to severe climatic conditions at least since the beginning of the Little Ice Age (approximately AD 1580). The site was deforested by the 1750 fire, because of the limited regenerative potential of stunted spruce. Postfire spruce exclusion has been responsible for major environmental changes associated with a thinner snow cover. Along the border of the deforested site snow cover depth was controlled by living spruces, whereas postfire shrubs (mostly dwarf birch, Betula glandulosa) of the lichen-tundra stand were unable to trap drifting snow. A significant decrease in thickness of the snow cover following deforestation was deduced from a comparative analysis of stem morphology of prefire spruces and present snow conditions. Inception of gelifluction lobes and mudboils was also caused by a change in the soil thermal regime associated with a reduced snow cover. Our results confirm the hypothesis that several lichen stands of the forest-tundra are postfire communities succeeding from degraded conifer stands during cold periods of the late Holocene.

AB The grasshoppers Phoetaliotes nebrascensis and Orphulella speciosa overlap extensively in both diet and habitat in native tallgrass prairie at Konza Prairie, Kansas. I tested for interspecific competition between these two species during a drought year when primary productivity in the prairie was unusually low. In late June 1989, 1 transferred young nymphs of P. nebrascensis among enclosed plots (each 550-900 m2) to produce three pairs of plots with grasshoppers removed or added. Pretransfer densities in the six plots were estimated at 6 nymphS/m2. Experimental transfers resulted in densities of P. nebrascensis in addition plots 2-3 times as large as in paired removal plots; significant differences in density between addition and removal plots persisted throughout the summer.
   Densities of O. speciosa in plots with P. nebrascensis removed or added did not differ significantly throughout the growing season of 1989, nor in early summer of 1990. Furthermore, growth and development of O. speciosa in these plots (as measured by rate of maturation, and adult femur length and mass in 1989) were not reduced in the presence of high densities of P. nebrascensis, nor was reproductive potential (measured as the ratio of young nymphs present in early summer 1990 to adults in late summer 1989). These results are similar to those of a previous experiment at the same site during 1987 when primary productivity was moderate. Even under the extreme conditions of 1989, with particularly high ratios of grasshoppers to available food resources, variation in P. nebrascensis density did not adversely affect populations of O. speciosa. These results contrast with recent results for sedentary phytophagous insects, but are consistent with the hypothesis that free-ranging insect herbivores may rarely experience interspecific competition for food resources.

AB A three-dimensional spatial perspective was used to determine annual macroinvertebrate production in two low-gradient, first-order stream systems on the Coastal Plain physiographic province of Virginia. Production in predominant habitats was weighted by the proportional areal abundance of each habitat to determine production in the channel surface, hyporheic zone, and floodplains of both blackwater streams.
   Highest production as dry mass in Buzzards Branch, a sand-bottomed stream, was in debris dams (27.4 g/m2); production on the sand sediment was lower (4.9 g/m2) and decreased with depth into the hyporheic zone, primarily as a function of decreasing oxygen concentration. Production on the floodplain varied with elevation, and hence period of inundation; it was 1.1 and 4.3 g/m2 at high and low elevations, respectively. Production, weighted for habitat abundance, was 1.7 g/m2 on the floodplain and 15.8 g/m2 in the channel (10.2 g/m2 in the hyporheic zone; 5.6 g/m2 on the channel surface). Production in the Buzzards Branch stream system, incorporating the channel and floodplain, was 2.4 g/m2, 67% of which was on the floodplain, 21% in the hyporheic zone, and 12% on the channel surface.
   Production in the Colliers Creek system, with a clay and detritus sediment and no hyporheic zone, was only 2.8 g/m2 in debris dams but was 6.1-6.6 g/m2 on channel sediments and floodplain soils. Production in the stream system was 6.1 g/m2, 95% of which was on the floodplain.
   Primary consumers composed 72-74% of production in the channels and 80-85% on the floodplains. The predominant functional feeding groups differed between habitats, suggesting a spatial mosaic of functioning within the stream systems. The majority of production in debris dams and on the sediment was by shredders (30-46%) and predators (31-48%). Collector-gatherers composed 58% of production in the Buzzards Branch hyporheic zone and 56-61% on the floodplains of both streams.
   This study further emphasizes the patchy nature of lotic systems and that habitat-specific sampling is required to adequately determine invertebrate production and function in streams. It also shows the need to view streams with a three-dimensional spatial perspective. Both the hyporheic zone and floodplains can contribute a significant proportion of invertebrate production in low-gradient stream systems.

AB This study was undertaken to provide an estimate of the functional response curve of the moose during winter.  The functional response consists of two components:  the intake rate while foraging and the time available for food searching.  In generalist herbivores an interaction may exist between those two components, because the quality of food eaten (expressed as digestibility) may limit the period available for grazing.  Thus, variation in intake rate while foraging in relation to food availability may give a biased estimate of functional response in such animals.
   We studied the relationship between the different components of functional response during winter for a generalist browser, the moose Alces alces, by comparing the intake rates of free-ranging individuals foraging on three Norwegian winter ranges of different quality.  The intake rate was determined by collecting feces defecated during a 24-h period by radiocollared individuals.  The amount of food eaten was found by multiplying the dry mass of feces with the inverse of the digestibility of the twigs eaten during that period.
   No relationship was found between intake rate and either snow depth or temperature.
   Body mass accounted for a large proportion of the variance in intake rates.  The slope in the regression of intake rate on body mass (b = 0.73) was close to the one expected from Kleiber's law.  However, when calves and adults were analyzed separately, a significant allometric relationship was found only for the calves.
   The intake rates of both age groups increased linearly with resource availability.  This relationship also remained after accounting for the effects of body mass in a multiple-regression analysis.  The intake rate also increased with the digestibility of the twigs eaten.  However, twig digestibility was closely correlated with resource abundance in the present data set, so the separate effects of quality and quantity were difficult to estimate.
   In the present data set no significant relationship appeared between resource availability and the time used for foraging.  Thus, the functional response of winter-foraging moose was linearly related to the resource availability.  However, we suggest that the quality of the food also should be included in the computation of functional response curves of large herbivores.  Consequently, the functional response should be described in three dimensions as a function of quality and quantity of the food resources.

AB Fertilization success was measured in the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, a tropical reef fish with external fertilization of pelagic eggs.  This species exhibits intraspecific variation in its spawning behavior; females either spawn with single males (pair spawning) or spawn with a group of at least three and often > 20 males (group spawning).  Fertilization success averaged almost-equal-to 75% and did not differ between pair and group spawning, despite an estimated 80-fold increase in sperm release in group spawns.  There was also no evidence that pair-spawning males suffered sperm depletion over the course of the spawning period.  Thalassoma bifasciatum occurs in a variety of habitats and is exposed to varying levels of water turbulence.  Fertilization success varied among days, and decreased with rougher water conditions.  Within a reef, the calmer spawning sites behind the reef relative to the current had higher fertilization success than those along the side of the reef.  These data suggest that while the type of spawning occurring at the site does not affect selection for fertilization success, females may gain fertilizations by selecting particular locations or periods of calmer water conditions to spawn.  This is an alternative hypothesis to explain temporal and spatial patterns of mating.  We provide detailed methods on how to accurately obtain data on fertilization success.  Our technique can be used to study natural spawning in a wide variety of reef fishes and other marine organisms with pelagic eggs, external fertilization, and predictable spawning.

AB Eurosta solidaginis (Diptera: Tephritidae) is a common, nonoutbreaking herbivore of goldenrod (Solidago altissima) whose populations fluctuate little through time. A large body of theory is based upon the assumption that nonoutbreaking phytophagous insects are regulated at "endemic equilibria" by the temporally density-dependent mortality caused by their natural enemies. This equilibrium viewpoint has been challenged recently by proponents of "nonequilibrium theory," even though the evidence against population regulation is largely observational and likely to be biased by the almost exclusive study of abundant, pest species. To understand the nature of population stability in Eurosta solidaginis, I altered the density of 20 subpopulations, and looked for compensatory changes in mortality that could allow the populations to return to their pre-experimental density. Mortality diminished in those subpopulations whose density was decreased. Moreover, the change in mortality depended significantly on the change in density; subpopulations in which density was most severely diminished enjoyed a greater decrease in mortality. Of four individual mortality agents, only "early larval death," which may be partly caused by a defensive reaction by the host plant, showed significant density dependence. No within-generation (spatial) density dependence was detected in either the first or the second (experimental) generation. At the end of the density-manipulation experiment, all Eurosta were removed from the patches. Most patches were recolonized within one generation.

AB An analysis of the life history and energetics responses of two small planktonic cladocerans, Daphnia ambigua and Ceriodaphnia quadrangula, to food limitation is presented. The results are consistent with an earlier study of D. pulex in that the size-specific instar durations and proportional investments in reproduction are independent of the food level. Compared to D. pulex, these smaller species spend more time in early instars but less time in adult instars. Of the energy available for (growth + reproduction), a much greater fraction is allocated to reproduction than in the case of similar-sized D. pulex, and it quickly reaches an asymptote of 94-97%. As in the case of D. pulex, the net rate of energy intake reaches a plateau shortly after maturity. This, combined with the increased cost of molting as the animal grows, causes age-specific reproduction to level off and eventually decline. The maximum rate of net energy intake is much lower and the cost of molting much higher for D. ambigua and C. quadrangula than for the larger D. pulex. This puts an upper limit on body size for the two smaller species that is much lower than that attainable in D. pulex. The data suggest the possibility that the sizes of planktonic cladocerans may be less a direct consequence of size-selective mortality than a correlated response to selection operating on energy-related traits.

AB We examined how CO2 concentrations and temperature interacted to affect growth, resource acquisition, and resource allocation of two annual plants that were supplied with a single pulse of nutrients. Physiological and growth measurements were made on individuals of Abutilon theophrasti (C3) and Amaranthus retroflexus (C4) grown in environments with atmospheric CO2 levels of 400 or 700-muL/L and with light/dark temperatures of 28-degrees/22-degrees or 38-degrees/31-degrees-C. Elevated CO2 and temperature treatments had significant independent and interactive effects on plant growth, resource allocation, and resource acquisition (i.e., photosynthesis and nitrogen uptake), and the strength and direction of these effects were often dependent on plant species. For example, final biomass of Amaranthus was enhanced by elevated CO2 at 28-degrees but was depressed at 38-degrees. For Abutilon, elevated CO2 increased initial plant relative growth rates at 28-degrees but not at 38-degrees, and had no significant effects on final biomass at either temperature.
   These results are interpreted in light of the interactive effects of CO2 and temperature on the rates of net leaf area production and loss, and on net whole-plant nitrogen retention. At 28-degrees-C, elevated CO2 stimulated the initial production of leaf area in both species, which led to an initial stimulation of biomass accumulation at the higher CO2 level. However, in elevated CO2 at 28-degrees, the rate of net leaf area loss for Abutilon increased while that of Amaranthus decreased. Furthermore, high CO2 apparently enhanced the ability of Amaranthus to retain nitrogen at this temperature, which may have helped to enhance photosynthesis, whereas nitrogen retention was unaffected in Abutilon. Thus, at 28-degrees, final biomass of Abutilon was not stimulated in a high CO2 environment whereas the final biomass of Amaranthus was. At 38-degrees, Abutilon had slightly reduced peak leaf areas under elevated CO2 in comparison to ambient CO2 grown plants, but increased rates of photosynthesis per unit leaf area early in the experiment apparently compensated for reduced leaf area. For Amaranthus at 38-degrees, peak leaf area production was not affected by CO2 treatment, but the rate of net leaf area loss hastened under elevated CO2 conditions and was accompanied by substantial reductions of whole-plant nitrogen content and leaf photosynthesis. This may have led to the reduced biomass accumulation of high CO2 grown plants that we observed during the last 30 d of growth.
   Plants of both species grown in elevated CO2 exhibited reduced tissue-specific rates of nitrogen absorption, increased plant photosynthetic rate per unit of conductance, and increased initial allocation of biomass to roots, irrespective of temperature. Plants of both species grown under an elevated temperature regime had substantially decreased reproductive allocation, increased allocation to stem biomass, and increased plant water flux at both CO2 treatments. The age of plants also affected our interpretations of plant responses to CO2 and temperature treatments. For example, significant effects of CO2 treatment on the growth of Abutilon were evident early, prior to the initiation of flowering, when nitrogen availability would have been highest and pot space would not have been limited. Nevertheless, the opposite was true for Amaranthus, in which significant effects of CO2 treatment on plant growth were not detectable until the final 30 d of the experiment.
   Elevated CO2 interacted with temperature to affect plant productivity in different ways than would have been predicted from plant responses to elevated CO2 alone. Furthermore, a majority of the interactive effects of CO2 concentration and temperature on plant growth could be interpreted in light of their effects on the rates of net leaf area production and loss, nitrogen retention, and, to a lesser degree, photosynthesis and resource partitioning.

AB We investigated the role of ant behavior as a selective influence on the presentation and morphology of elaiosome-bearing seeds in Australian sclerophyll vegetation by manipulating characteristics of natural and artificial diaspores.  We compared the response to these diaspores of three seed-removing ant species, two of which (Rhytidoponera "metallica" and Aphaenogaster longiceps), produce more favorable seed fates than the third species (Pheidole sp. 1).  We measured the effect on removal rate of diaspore arrangement (degree of clumping), elaiosome removal, diaspore size (i.e., mass), elaiosome/load ratio, and composition of both the elaiosome and seed.
   Clumped seeds were removed significantly faster than single seeds by Pheidole sp. 1, a group forager. A. longiceps, a solitary forager, removed single seeds faster while R. "metallica" removed single and clumped seeds at the same rate.  The presence of elaiosomes on seeds increased removal rates, especially by A. longiceps and R. "metallica."  Both A. longiceps and R. "metallica" responded positively to elaiosome/load ratio while Pheidole sp. 1 responded mainly to diaspore size.  These species-specific responses were such that diaspores with high elaiosome/seed ratios are more likely to be removed by A. longiceps or R. "metallica" than by Pheidole sp. 1.  Diaspore characteristics other than size had inconsistent effects on removal rates.
   The differential response of the ant species to such characteristics as seed arrangement and elaiosome/seed ratios demonstrates the way in which ant behavior may have been an important selective force in the evolution and maintenance of myrmecochory.

AB We experimentally tested the ability of generalist predatory ants to structure sawfly gall communities through differential predation on sawfly-galler larvae in relation to their life history patterns. Galler larvae of three species exit their galls in late summer and are exposed to predatory ants, while larvae of one species (stem-gallers) remain within their galls to overwinter. Many ant species (Formicidae) are patchily abundant in willows in northern Arizona. The abundances of four galler species and the activity levels of ant assemblages were assessed in census studies performed on variable numbers of willow clones between 1986 and 1989. Two distinct types of sawfly gall communities were found on willow clones in the study area, communities composed of four galler species (stem, leaf, and petiole galls, and leaf folds), and communities composed primarily of stem galls. Clones with low ant activity levels support the former, whereas those with high activity levels support the latter.
   Experimental introductions of larvae of two exiting species (leaf- and petiole-gallers) into and beneath natural willow clones with high and low ant activity levels showed that larvae are quickly captured by ants in and under high activity willows. Ants were not selective to larval species in these introductions, and were clearly shown to be generalist predators when experimentally offered two species of larvae. Experimental introductions of leaf- and petiole-galler larvae into four clones with high ant activity in 1987 and 1988 did not result in higher gall populations in the following year, indicating that larvae did not survive to recruit into those clones as adults. Experimental caging of leaf- and petiole-galler adults onto branches of high activity clones resulted in the establishment of modest populations of both species, followed by seemingly normal gall development patterns and larval survival rates inside galls. We conclude that the absence of leaf and petiole galls from willows with high ant activity is due to intensive larval predation by generalist ants, and not to plant resistance factors. This means that generalist and opportunistic predatory ants can significantly structure insect gall communities through differential predation that is dependent upon specific life history traits of some gallers.

AB Diet selectivity by the planktivorous bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) is correlated with the fishes' visual resolution. Poor visual capabilities are thought to impose a constraint on the ability of small sunfish to choose prey. Li et al. (1985) suggested that sunfish subjected to conditions of poor visual resolution select prey in accordance with a model in which prey choice is determined by apparent prey size. Further, enhanced visual resolution permitted large sunfish to assess absolute prey size more accurately than could smaller conspecifics and, consequently, large-sized sunfish consumed relatively more large prey than was predicted by the apparent size model. Here, we examine the visual capabilities and prey selection of very small sunfish, extend the analyses of Li et al. by determining the optimal diet sets for the fish used in their study, and compare prey selection by all sunfish size categories to that predicted by the apparent size and optimal foraging models. Contrary to the conclusions of Li et al., small sunfish (< 20 mm standard length [SL]) were more selective than was predicted by the apparent size model and preferentially attacked small-sized Daphnia. The optimal foraging "prey" model predicted correctly the size-related changes in mean size of prey attacked by sunfish, whereas the apparent size model predicted a preference for larger Daphnia for all sizes of fish. Yet, the observed diet breadths were always larger than those predicted by the optimal foraging model. The visual system and energy considerations constrain prey selection in small sunfish but operate in opposite fashions.

AB Large variations in vital rates are found among individuals in populations of Ascophyllum nodosum along the Swedish west coast due to temporal variation in the environment (years with or without ice).  The population growth in these stochastic environments was analyzed for two populations using model simulations.  A matrix model with a set of three population projection matrices for each population described the demography during three different types of years (environments), i.e., years with (1) no ice, (2) moderate damage due to ice, (3) large damage due to ice.  The frequency of ice years is known for the area studied and was higher at one site (Goteborg) compared to the other (Tjarno).  These frequencies were used as the stochastic process generating the sequence of matrices.  The mean mortality rates decreased with increasing size in both populations.  Simulating the growth for survival matrices (no reproduction included) resulted in an average population growth rate lambda(s) of 0.84 at Tjarno and 0.76 at Goteborg.  The average growth rate lambda(s) was set to 1 by scaling the set of matrices for each population with a fertility function.  To achieve lambda(s) = 1, almost-equal-to 3.2 times more fertility in each size class was required at Goteborg.  Because of the large environmental variability, lambda(s) varied from 0.3 to 1.3 during a long stochastic sample path.  The maximum lifetime of A. nodosum individuals was estimated to be almost-equal-to 50-60 yr, which probably is shorter than for areas with no ice.  The population growth with the sets of scaled matrices (reproduction included) was simulated by following a large number of subpopulations for 300 yr.  With extinction defined as the first passage time through the point N = 1, almost-equal-to 25% of the subpopulations "died" during the simulation, and the mean extinction time for those who died was 163 yr.  An elasticity analysis of lambda(s) to changes in the matrix elements showed that at each time step is was most important for A. nodosum individuals to survive and grow to the next larger size class or to survive and remain in the same size class.

AB The influences of neighbors and flow regime on growth patterns and feeding rates of the bryozoan Electra pilosa were characterized in laboratory and field experiments. In laboratory studies, neighbors inhibited growth, while flow velocity exerted a negative effect on growth rates of isolated colonies but had no influence on growth rates of colonies with neighboring Electra upstream. There were no significant effects of neighborhood or flow on zooid dimensions. Field experiments, which only tested the influence of neighbors on growth, revealed a similar reduction in growth in the presence of neighbors. The growth responses displayed by Electra do not support predictions of adaptive strategy models: despite its noted range in colony morphology, Electra did not assume more runner-like shapes when growth conditions were poor. Rather, growth of Electra appeared to be a result of local astogenetic (colonial ontogenetic) rules. Colonies that fed from similar flows to those they had experienced in the laboratory provide evidence backing the common assumption that patterns of feeding result in growth responses and so may be related to fitness in colonial animals. Evidence that growth patterns resulted from feeding rates suggests a central role for the acquisition of food in the dynamics of benthic assemblages of suspension feeders.

AB The abundance and distribution of corvids (Common Raven, Corvus corax; Hooded Crow, C. corone; Jackdaw, C. monedula; Black-billed Magpie, Pica pica; and European Jay, Garrulus glandarius) were studied across a gradient from a landscape dominated by agricultural land to a landscape dominated by forest in south-central Sweden. The total density and the predation rate on dummy nests increased as the proportion of agricultural land increased. This supports the suggestion that the density of corvids increases as forest becomes fragmented and intermixed with agricultural land, causing an increase in nest predation in small forest fragments. However, the different species responded differently to the proportion of forest in the landscape.
   The two forest-living corvids, the Jay and Raven, were absent from small forest fragments in a matrix of agricultural land and mainly preyed upon dummy nests inside the large forest fragments. Thus, both of these species were habitat specialists restricted to forests. Three corvids basically inhabit agricultural land, the Hooded Crow, Jackdaw, and Magpie. The Jackdaw and the Magpie showed a strong preference for agricultural land and they mainly preyed upon dummy nests in agricultural land. On the other hand, the density of Hooded Crows was higher in landscapes with a mixture of agricultural land and forest than in landscapes dominated by either agricultural land or forest, indicating a use of both agricultural land and forest. Further, Hooded Crows regularly preyed upon nests in both forest habitat and agricultural land; it is a habitat generalist. Therefore, the Hooded Crow was the most important species in the corvid family, causing increased predation pressure close to forest-farmland edges and in small forest fragments surrounded by agricultural land.

AB In view of theoretical interest in the relationships between mating systems and dispersal patterns and the paucity of empirical data on dispersal in monogamous mammals, I studied natal dispersal in the monogamous rodent Peromyscus californicus. Genealogical relationships were determined using fluorescent pigment transfer and DNA fingerprinting, and dispersal distances were determined using dispersal fences and intensive trapping. Minimum dispersal distances were greater for females than for males. Philopatric males (those settling within one home-range diameter of their birth site) tended to be from smaller litters than non-philopatric males. Minimum dispersal distances of males were positively associated with natal litter size at weaning, whereas minimum dispersal distances of females were positively associated with number of sisters in the natal litter. These results suggest that intrasexual mate competition drives female dispersal, while resource competition drives male dispersal. Males remain closer to their natal range than females, most likely to acquire and defend resources to attract females. Peromyscus californicus is unusual among mammals in displaying both a monogamous mating system and female-biased dispersal.

AB Temporal density-dependent parasitism and a host threshold density are important features of disease induced by infectious parasites in populations of aboveground, macroscopic organisms.  We determined whether these features also occur in soil microcosms containing a microscopic host (the nematode Heterodera schachtii) and its parasite (the nematophagous fungus Hirsutella rhossiliensis).  Soil microcosms are especially interesting because (1) the environment and scale are quite different from conventional host-parasite systems and may result in considerably different disease dynamics, (2) the small size of the soil microcosms, although biologically appropriate, facilitates experimentation and parameter estimation, and (3) some soil-borne, microscopic organisms (such as H. schachtii) are important agricultural pests.
   Temporal density-dependent parasitism was directly assessed with laboratory experiments in which host density and environment were controlled.  A theory, which complements and extends the experiments, was developed to enable direct comparison of observed and predicted dynamics and to provide a stringent test of our understanding of processes underlying the dynamics.  The theory was simple, yet explicitly described the essential biology.  Parameters for the theory were measured with short-term experiments.
   We found that the disease dynamics in soil microcosms exhibited both temporal density-dependent parasitism and a host threshold density.  However, epidemics were slow to develop.  Observed and predicted dynamics were quite similar, indicating that our understanding of the underlying biology was correct.

AB Experimental studies using root observation chambers to observe the effects of encounters between individual roots on root elongation rates have revealed that the interactions among roots of Ambrosia dumosa and Larrea tridentata are more complex than simple competition for a limiting resource. Larrea roots inhibited elongation of either Larrea or Ambrosia roots in their vicinity, and Ambrosia roots inhibited elongation of contacted roots on other Ambrosia plants only.
   The purpose of the study reported here was to test the hypothesized involvement of inhibitory substances released by roots in these interroot encounters by attempting to remove such substances by adsorption to activated carbon. The presence of activated carbon caused a significant decrease in the inhibition of elongation of neighboring roots by Larrea roots, but activated carbon had no effect on the intraspecific responses of Ambrosia roots. These results support the hypotheses that the interaction mechanism of Larrea roots involves the release of a readily diffusible, generally inhibitory substance by Larrea roots into the soil, rather than a simple depletion of water or nutrients from around Larrea roots, and that the intraspecific, self-nonself-recognizing interaction mechanism of Ambrosia roots is mediated by contact and is fundamentally different from that of Larrea.
   These findings may enhance our understanding of Mojave desert community structure. The root-mediated allelopathy of Larrea may play a role in producing and maintaining the commonly occurring, regular distributions of Larrea. The complex communication mechanism of Ambrosia roots appears to constitute a detection and avoidance system that may allow this shrub to grow in clumped intraspecific distributions with little or no intraspecific competition for water. The interspecific interference between Larrea and Ambrosia in the field may be mechanistically asymmetrical due to their different root communication mechanisms.

AB Two common features of biological communities are (a) complex interactions among species, which make community dynamics sensitive to initial conditions, and (b) spatial heterogeneity, which fragments large-scale ecological systems into a mosaic of patches, hereafter termed a "metacommunity." This computer simulation study examines the effect of complex interactions on the global and local dynamics of metacommunities. Patches are physically identical and differ only in the initial proportion of species that colonize the patches. The random variation is then magnified by deterministic interactions that cause patches to follow different trajectories based on initial conditions. After a period of interaction, individuals from all patches join a global pool of dispersers that colonize a new "generation" of patches.
   Complex interactions can have at least two important effects on metacommunity dynamics. First, the number of species coexisting in the metacommunity can greatly exceed the number of species coexisting in any single patch, despite the fact that the patches are physically identical, the species do not differ in colonization ability, and stochastic effects are absent after the colonization stage. Second, complex interactions provide a new source of variation upon which natural selection can operate at the patch level, providing a mechanism for the evolution of functionally organized communities.

AB Predator-prey theory is traced from its origins in the Malthus-Verhulst logistic equation, through the Lotka-Volterra equations, logistic modifications to both prey and predator equations, incorporation of the Michaelis-Menten-Holling functional response into the predator and prey equations, and the recent development of ratio-dependent functional responses and per-capita rate of change functions. Some of the problems of classical predator-prey theory, including the paradoxes of enrichment and biological control, seem to have been caused by the application of the principle of mass action to predator-prey interactions. Predator-prey models that evolved from logistic theory or that incorporate ratio-dependent functional responses do not have these problems and also seem to be more biologically plausible.

AB Abert's squirrels (Sciurus aberti) are restricted to stands of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and feed heavily on the inner bark tissues of these trees. Although preferences for inner bark of particular trees (target trees) have been well documented, the basis of the squirrels' selectivity has not been clearly demonstrated. Compared with matched nontarget (uneaten) trees, and with whole populations of ponderosa pine, target trees had significantly lower xylem oleoresin flow rates, and significantly lower levels of beta-pinene and beta-phellandrene in the xylem oleoresin. In feeding trials with free-ranging animals, food laced with ecologically realistic concentrations of either beta-pinene or beta-phellandrene were eaten significantly less than control food. The phloem of target trees had significantly higher concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates and sodium, and significantly lower concentrations of iron and mercury, than the phloem of matched nontarget trees. Oleoresin characteristics associated with selective herbivory were unaffected by simulated herbivory over 2 yr, supporting existing evidence that these characteristics are under strong genetic control. Because herbivory is associated with these host traits and results in dramatic reductions in host fitness, Abert's squirrels are probably important agents of natural selection in host ponderosa pine populations.

AB Sex allocation patterns and nutrient investments in floral components were investigated in hermaphroditic morphs of Sidalcea oregana ssp. spicata utilizing a micro-technique for the determination of nitrogen and phosphorus content. A plant's investment in flowers and individual floral components decreased from early to late in the season. The primary sexual structures (gynoecium and pollen) showed less severe seasonal declines in nitrogen and phosphorus allocation than did the sepals and petals. Phenotypic gender remained relatively constant throughout the season. Sepals, gynoecium tissue, and pollen had significantly higher concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus than did the androecium and petals. Pollen had the highest requirement for phosphorus. These results suggest that the sex functions could be limited by different nutrients. Proportional allocation to floral structures varied with time of season and currency used. A seasonal decrease in the proportion of biomass in the sepals was accompanied by an increase in the proportional allocation to each of the reproductive structures. Selection may favor preserving a minimum level of allocation to the primary sexual structures if gamete (or zygote) fitness is influenced by resource availability during production and/or maturation.

AB Gross rates of N mineralization, immobilization, and nitrification were measured by N-15 isotope dilution in a 10-yr-old conifer plantation and in a mature conifer forest. Gross rates revealed nutrient cycling characteristics that differ from expectations based on more common measures of net rates. Although net mineralization rates were somewhat higher in the young forest than in the old forest, gross mineralization rates in the old forest were 2-3 times as high as gross mineralization rates in the young forest, indicating more rapid turnover of inorganic-N pools in the old forest. Net mineralization rates were < 14% of gross mineralization rates. Smaller NO3- pool size and lower net nitrification rates in the old forest than the young forest might lead to the conclusion that the old forest is a non-nitrifying ecosystem and that nitrate is important only in the N cycle of the young forest. However, gross nitrification rates were similar in both young and old forests. Microbial assimilation of NO3- was also significant in both forests, indicating a rapid turnover of a small but important NO3- pool. Microbial assimilation may be an important pathway for NO3- retention in forest ecosystems.

AB Influences of ant behavior on short- and long-term fate of elaiosome-bearing seeds were investigated in fire-prone sclerophyll vegetation near Sydney, New South Wales.  The short-term fate of seeds was assessed by measuring dispersal distances, seed predation within ant nests, and seed burial.  Most seeds were taken directly to ant nests.  The mean dispersal distance was 1.1 m (range 0.06-11 m).  Seed predation by three ant species was measured by feeding known quantities of seeds and inedible seed mimics, made from plastic beads, into nests.  Nests were excavated 2, 7, and 30 d later to recover seeds and beads.  The recovery rate of beads estimated the disappearance rate of seeds from nests due to factors other than predation.  Pheidole sp. 1 appeared to eat most seeds soon after collection but also stored some seeds in small caches within the nest.  Both Rhytidoponera "metallica" and Aphaenogaster longiceps removed most seeds from the nest intact (the elaiosome having been consumed) and discarded them on the surface, but left some within nests at depths < 12 cm.  Seeds discarded on the soil surface may undergo secondary dispersal by other ants.  A transition matrix analysis was used to assess the importance of this secondary dispersal route and to estimate the probabilities that seeds initially taken by a particular ant species would be either eaten or finally buried within a nest.  The analysis indicated firstly that a significant proportion of seeds initially removed by A. longiceps and R. "metallica" will eventually be eaten by Pheidole spp.  Secondly, some seeds will be discarded in the nests of species other than the original seed remover.  The analysis also indicated that seeds initially taken by A. longiceps and R. "metallica" would be more likely to survive than those taken by Pheidole sp. 1.
   As many Australian ant-dispersed seeds are stimulated to germinate by fire, long-term seed fate was investigated by monitoring seedling emergence after fire from ant nests that had been fed a known quantity of seeds.  Overall emergence was almost-equal-to 1% of seeds fed into nests.  The greatest emergence was from nests of A. longiceps.  This result is qualitatively consistent with those of the short-term experiments.  However, the low overall emergence rate meant the power of this experiment to detect statistical differences between ant species was limited.  The spatial pattern of emerging seedlings differed between nests of the different ant species.  Seedlings from the nests of Pheidole sp. 1 were considerably more clumped than those from nests of the other three species.
   The seed fate experiments collectively indicated that seed-removing ants have different effects on seed fate, with A. longiceps and R. "metallica" being more beneficial than Pheidole.

AB The combined effects of dietary imbalance and the allelochemical tannic acid on fifth stadium Locusta migratoria were investigated. In a factorial-design experiment, insects were fed artificial diets containing digestible carbohydrates and proteins in equal proportions (14 or 28%), or in a 1:2 or 2:1 ratio, with or without 10% tannic acid. Growth, consumption, and utilization efficiencies were measured over the course of the fifth stadium, and histological analyses of the midguts of newly molted adults were undertaken.
   While the consumption of diet was higher on the 14%-protein diets, consumption of protein remained lower than on the 28%-protein diets, indicating that compensatory feeding for protein was incomplete. Similarly, compensation for low dietary carbohydrates occurred, but was incomplete. Low levels of either nutrient resulted in increased intake of the other, but the effect of protein on carbohydrate intake was stronger than vice versa. There was a statistically interactive effect of carbohydrate and protein on the amounts of carbohydrate consumed, resulting from the fact that particularly high levels of carbohydrate were consumed when the diets simultaneously contained 28% carbohydrate and 14% protein. The terms "incidental augmentation" and "incidental restriction" of intake are introduced to describe the ways that certain nutrient groups may affect the intake of others in foods that are nutritionally imbalanced.
   Tannic acid resulted in reduced efficiency of conversion of ingested nitrogen, but the efficiency of conversion of total ingested nutrients was higher on the diets containing tannic acid. A higher frequency of lesions was observed in the midgut epithelia of tannin-fed insects than controls, and it is suggested that the sloughing of necrotic epithelial tissues into the lumen and their subsequent egestion with the feces may account for the reduced efficiency of nitrogen conversion in these insects. A statistical interaction between protein levels and tannic acid demonstrated that tannic acid reduced consumption, but only of the low protein diets. Therefore, the effect of tannic acid was to restrict compensatory feeding for protein. A consequence of this was reduced growth in insects fed low-protein diets containing tannic acid.
   Total growth (dry mass) was lower on the 28%-protein diets and higher on the 28%-carbohydrate diets, and therefore corresponded with levels of carbohydrate intake. Nitrogen accumulation increased with dietary protein levels, but remained constant across carbohydrate levels despite increased intake of nitrogen on low-carbohydrate diets. This was accounted for by lower efficiency of conversion of nitrogen on the 14%-carbohydrate diets. Approximate digestibility was higher for the 14%-protein diets, possibly reflecting increased intake of easily digested carbohydrates. There were no statistically significant interactive effects between the two nutrients, or between either nutrient and tannic acid, on utilization efficiencies.

AB Evolutionary host-size models assume that host quality for parasitoid growth and development is a linear function of host size. To test this assumption, we compared the growth patterns of the hymenopteran parasitoid Aphidius ervi when it developed in different nymphal instars of apterous pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum. At daily intervals, unparasitized aphids and aphids that were parasitized at age 24, 48, 72, and 120 h (corresponding to nymphal instars L1-L4) were dissected. We weighed parasitoid larvae and host remains to determine changes in their relative growth rates, based on wet mass (WM) and dry mass (DM). The growth in DM of unparasitized aphids followed a sigmoid curve. Aphids that were parasitized by A. ervi continued to grow for 5-7 d before their DM started to decline. Trajectories of the parasitoid's growth during its larval and pupal stages could be described by nonlinear equations. The maximum larval DM and the time from oviposition to adult eclosion of parasitoids varied with host age at parasitization, and thus suggested differences in host quality. We propose that, for parasitoids developing in growing and feeding stages of the host, host quality is not a linear function of host size at parasitization but reflects the degree of integration of the two systems.

AB We compared rates and directions of benthic aquatic macroinvertebrate succession following eight spates of varying magnitude that occurred in different seasons over 3 yr in Sycamore Creek, a Sonoran Desert stream. A consistent cycle of seasonal change in assemblage composition occurred each year, little altered by spates. Changes reflected variations in presence or absence rather than relative abundance of taxa. Seasonal patterns were confirmed by plotting temporal changes in densities of common taxa. Invertebrate abundance (mostly oligochaetes and mayflies) peaked in spring. "Summer" dominants included the gastropod Physella virgata and the caddisfly larva Cheumatopsyche arizonensis. Assemblage composition remained relatively consistent during spring over 3 yr when high discharge was prolonged, whereas there was a major change in autumn community structure between 1984 and 1986, probably reflecting low discharge during a drought in 1986. Drying apparently influenced assemblage composition more than spates, possibly by altering habitat availability and the intensity of biotic interactions as surface stream volume shrank.
   Assemblage resistance to disturbance by spates was variable. Similarly, resistance of individual common taxa varied within and among taxa, and like assemblage resistance, was not simply a function of spate magnitude or timing (season). Resilience was generally high. Succession rate (degree of change in assemblage composition) declined during succession in all but spring sequences, which displayed no consistent trend. The two summer sequences had highest initial succession rates (in first 30 d postspate), possibly reflecting higher water temperatures, and also exhibited late-successional increases in succession rate. Spatial variation in assemblage composition was uncorrelated with any physical variable measured.
   Factors known to influence ecosystem-level processes such as primary productivity (e.g., inorganic nitrogen flux, days since spate) also affected community-level aspects such as aquatic invertebrate assemblage composition in Sycamore Creek. Discharge and water temperature had lesser but detectable effects, and probably contributed to the marked seasonality in assemblage composition. Further comparisons of collective properties of ecosystems and communities within other biomes may identify "common denominators" that characterize responses to disturbance and environmental change. This will remove the different perceptions about stability we gain by using response variables that are assessed only at a community or ecosystem level.

AB We examined the effect of body size and habitat on mortality rates of juvenile and adult sailfin mollies (Poecilia latipinna) maintained in field cages that excluded predators. Mortality rates and the extent of size dependence varied among years and among seasons within years for juvenile and adult fish. When mortality rates were size dependent, large individuals had lower mortality rates than small ones. Differences between habitats in mortality rates were present in some experiments but not others. When there were habitat effects under winter conditions, both juveniles and adults had higher survival rates in a saltwater habitat than in a freshwater one. Some adults survived through the winter in all of our experiments. Adult mortality during the growing season exhibited a similar pattern of habitat effects although at lower mortality rates. Juvenile survival to sexual maturity in the growing season showed no consistent effects of habitat. Fish born during the autumn had a much lower probability of survival to sexual maturity than those born in spring or summer, and there was a threshold time beyond which newborn fish were virtually assured of perishing over the winter, presumably due to the inability to achieve a minimum body size capable of withstanding winter conditions.
   These experiments illustrate that the net direction of selection on molly body size in any generation depends on events that are stochastic on a yearly scale, such as the climatic severity of the winter and the intensity of predation pressure. Our results illustrate the complex interplay of different sources of selective mortality that operate in natural populations, and highlight the importance of ecological investigations of the different agents of mortality for a predictive understanding of the operation of natural selection.

AB Misumena vatia (Thomisidae) spiderlings leaving nests guarded by their mothers experienced lower predatory pressure than those leaving unguarded nests. However, this relationship was independent of the size of either their mother or brood, traits affected by differences in maternal foraging success. The principal spiderling predator at this stage, the small salticid spider Metaphidippus insignis, hunted about unguarded, but not guarded, nests. Even the smallest Misumena mothers, being much larger than Metaphidippus, effectively guarded against the salticid, quickly driving it from their nests. This nonselective predation on the spiderlings, combined with the superior success of large broods exposed to parasitism by ichneumonid wasps, demonstrates that highly successful female Misumena foragers enjoy marked fitness advantages, at least through their offspring's dispersal from the nest. It supports the basic, though seldom tested, assumption of optimal foraging theory that success in foraging translates into enhanced lifetime fitness.

I sampled these species in January and August near the extremes of their altitudinal distributions in Puerto Rico.  Hollow electroformed copper lizard models, randomly positioned within habitats occupied by the lizards, served as operative temperature (T(e)) thermometers, providing baseline predictions about basking rates and T(b) of nonthermoregulating lizards.
   Comparison of the basking behavior and T(b) of lizards to the basking rates and temperatures of the models provided unambiguous evidence of nonrandom thermoregulatory activity in some of the lizard populations.  Although basking opportunities were similar in the habitats occupied by both species, basking rates differed markedly:  A. cristatellus basked more frequently than did randomly positioned models, and its basking rates were higher at high elevation and in January; A. gundlachi used basking sites at random at both elevations in both months.  In addition, A. cristatellus limited its activity, particularly at high elevation, to times when operative temperatures were relatively high or basking sites were available (i.e., sunny weather).
   As a result of its opportunistic basking activity, mean T(b) of A. cristatellus was often elevated above mean T(e), and A. cristatellus populations experienced only limited variation of mean T(b) with elevation and season.  In contrast, A.  gundlachi mean T(b) approximated mean T(e), and the T(b) of A. gundlachi varied more with elevation and season.  Mean T(b) in A. cristatellus was always higher than the mean T(b) of A. gundlachi at every elevation and month combination.  The data also suggest that the low T(b) experienced by A. gundlachi at high elevation might dramatically reduce sprinting ability, whereas the T(b) experienced by A. cristatellus allows a majority of lizards at high elevation to sprint quickly.

AB Floral nectar rewards are expected to contribute to plant fitness by influencing several aspects of pollinator behavior.  For example, when flowers have large standing crops of nectar, pollinators may take longer to probe them, thereby increasing the amounts of pollen deposited and removed.  In addition, pollinators may return more often to rewarding plants and/or probe more of their flowers during each visit.  We experimentally investigated how each of these behaviors influences pollination success of the hummingbird-pollinated herb Ipomopsis aggregata (scarlet gilia).  Captive hummingbirds were trained to probe flowers containing known volumes of artificial nectar (25% mass/mass sucrose solution).  Increasing the nectar standing crop of a flower from 1 to 5-mu-L significantly increased probe duration, but this had no detectable effect on pollination success through the female sexual function (pollen deposited on stigmas) or male sexual function (pollen removed from anthers and number of fluorescent dye particles exported to other flowers).  In contrast, both male and female pollination success increased with the number of times a hummingbird probed a flower.  For male function, there was at best a weak tendency for pollen export to diminish with successive probes, in contrast to strongly diminishing returns reported for bee-pollinated flowers.  This difference may reflect foraging mode; hummingbirds hover and remove a small fraction of available pollen with each floral probe whereas bees land and remove most pollen with the first probe.  For plants such as I. aggregata whose pollination success is most sensitive to the number of probes per flower, selection on nectar production may be strongest when there are cues pollinators can use to identify rewarding plants, such as phenotypic correlations between nectar production and floral morphology.

AB In stage-based demography, animals are often categorized into size (or mass) classes, and size-based probabilities of surviving and changing mass classes must be estimated before demographic analyses can be conducted. In this paper, we develop two procedures for the estimation of mass transition probabilities from capture-recapture data. The first approach uses a multistate capture-recapture model that is parameterized directly with the transition probabilities of interest. Maximum likelihood estimates are then obtained numerically using program SURVIV. The second approach involves a modification of Pollock's robust design. Estimation proceeds by conditioning on animals caught in a particular class at time i, and then using closed models to estimate the number of these that are alive in other classes at i + 1. Both methods are illustrated by application to meadow vole, Microtus pennsylvanicus, capture-recapture data. The two methods produced reasonable estimates that were similar. Advantages of these two approaches include the directness of estimation, the absence of need for restrictive assumptions about the independence of survival and growth, the testability of assumptions, and the testability of related hypotheses of ecological interest (e.g., the hypothesis of temporal variation in transition probabilities).

AB We examined effects of natural and experimentally created reductions in food abundance on the reproductive ecology of Black-throated Blue Warblers (Dendroica caerulescens). The study was carried out between 1982 and 1985 on four 30-ha plots of temperate deciduous forest within and near the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA. Experimental food reduction using aerially sprayed Bacillus thuringiensis created significant differences in caterpillar biomass between one sprayed and two unsprayed plots throughout the breeding season in 1983. Where caterpillar abundance was reduced, Black-throated Blue Warblers made significantly fewer nesting attempts and diets of nestlings included fewer caterpillars. Clutch size, hatching success, and number of young fledging per nest did not differ among the food reduction site and controls. Also, the reduced number of nesting attempts per pair on the food reduction site in 1983 did not significantly lower production of young per pair. No detectable differences in caterpillar biomass between sprayed and unsprayed sites were created in 1984 or 1985 because natural caterpillar abundances were already low.
   Natural declines in food abundance for Black-throated Blue Warblers occurred from 1982 through 1985, primarily because of a decrease in caterpillar abundances. Significant reductions in number of young fledging per nest, nestling growth rates and survival, and number of nests attempted per pair corresponded with the natural decline in food abundance. Of those measures, a reduced number of nesting attempts per pair lowered annual production the most. When effects of food limitation were calculated separately from those of nest predation, food limited annual breeding productivity to below that needed to balance annual mortality in at least one of the four years of this study. These findings indicate that neotropical migrant bird species are probably limited periodically by food when breeding in north-temperate habitats.

AB Theories of cascading trophic interactions provide specific predictions regarding the forces that regulate populations across trophic levels. Reducing predators in a food chain with three trophic levels should permit herbivores to increase, thus reducing primary producers. In a manipulative experiment involving a molluscivorous fish (pumpkinseed sunfish, Lepomis gibbosus), freshwater snails, and periphytic algae, we tested this prediction. With 10 cages (3 x 3 x 2 m) in each of two lakes in northern Wisconsin, we generated three treatments: exclosures (fishless), enclosures (three pumpkinseed sunfish), and cageless controls, both in Mann Lake, which had high natural densities of pumpkinseed sunfish (HDP), and in Round Lake, which had low densities (LDP). During a 16-mo experiment, we quantified snail and periphyton biomass on plastic flagging within treatments during summer at 3- and 6-wk intervals in 1986 and 1987, respectively.
   Predation by pumpkinseed sunfish reduced snail biomass on flagging, permitting periphyton biomass to increase, as compared to exclosures. As expected, periphyton biomass in cageless controls in Mann Lake (HDP) mirrored periphyton biomass in enclosures, whereas cageless controls in Round Lake (LDP) differed from exclosures. The periphyton assemblage changed dramatically with increasing grazing pressure. In enclosures (low grazing), filamentous algae and large, stalked diatoms dominated the periphyton assemblage, whereas in exclosures (high grazing), assemblages were dominated by small, adnate diatoms and a colonial, filamentous bluegreen alga (Gloeotrichia). In laboratory trials, snails preferentially fed on periphyton from enclosures (where grazing pressure had been low).
   Predation reduced snail density, but indirectly increased periphyton biomass, dramatically modifying species composition of the assemblage. Thus, in mesotrophic Wisconsin lakes, top-down interactions regulate the benthic, freshwater food chain.

AB Reproductive investment of the intertidal kelp Alaria nana was manipulated experimentally to investigate costs of reproduction. Allocation patterns were examined using treatments that employed vegetative and reproductive tissue removal. Growth, survivorship, size, reproductive investment, carbon, nitrogen, and phenolic secondary metabolites were monitored in tagged experimental plants. Further experiments investigated the contribution of reproductive tissue to drag forces on the plant in intertidal environments. Carbon, nitrogen, and phenolics were all higher in reproductive tissue (sporophylls) compared to vegetative tissue (the frond) in control plants. When some vegetative tissue was removed, carbon and nitrogen in the sporophylls decreased while percent phenolics remained unchanged. Reproductive tissue removal had no effect on plant survivorship, growth, or size compared with control plants. When the entire frond was kept clipped, sporophyll number decreased, often to the point of complete attrition. Although allocation patterns in Alaria nana are consistent with reproductive costs (i.e., the sporophylls are not self-supporting), there is no evidence that reproduction imposes costs on the plant that are demographically important such as growth, size, and survivorship. Instead, both reproductive investment and percent phenolics were positively correlated with growth and size in control plants.

AB Comparisons between competing and noncompeting populations of three annual plant species demonstrate that plant allometry is altered by competition.  When plants are grown in isolation, relationships between stem diameter, height, and plant mass generally show simple allometry (i.e., the relationships are linear on log-log scale).  When plants are competing, however, these relationships are curvilinear or discontinuous.
   We attempt to clarify the relationship between interindividual allometry (the usual source of allometric data) and allometric growth.  When plants are not competing, the allometric relationships among individuals of different sizes at one point in time and the allometry of individual plants as they grow appear to be similar, but these two classes of allometric relationships are very different for competing plants.  We present a simple model that explains both static and dynamic patterns of plant allometry in terms of (a) the allometric responses of individual plants to competition, and (b) the size dependence of growth after the onset of competition.
   Our results illustrate the importance of reciprocal interactions between competition and allometry, and emphasize the difficulty in making inferences from one size measure to another.  We conclude that the commonly held assumption that plant size is a single entity, which can be reflected by any of several measures, may not be justified.

AB The existence of elevated metabolic loads associated with the detoxification of plant allelochemicals has been proposed to be an important selective force in the evolution of dietary specialization of herbivorous insects. In this study we have examined the effects of one host plant toxin (nicotine) and three nonhost plant toxins (xanthotoxin, precocene II, and canavanine) on the growth and energy metabolism of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae).
   Although M. sexta has three mechanisms for reducing the toxic effects of nicotine, nicotine has a dose-dependent growth-inhibiting effect on third-instar larvae at dietary concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 8.0%. Thus, herbivory by adapted species, as well as nonadapted species, can potentially select for higher levels of defensive chemicals in plants. At higher concentrations, where the effects of nicotine are most pronounced, growth reduction is associated with reduced consumption (which reduces the amount of food assimilated) and an increase in the duration of the instar (which increases the amount of the assimilate pool that must be allocated to maintenance metabolism), thus leaving less assimilate for allocation to growth. The respiration rates of larvae on diets containing up to 1% nicotine are the same as the respiration rates of larvae on nicotine-free diets, while the respiration rates of larvae on diets containing 4 to 8% nicotine are lower than those of larvae on the nicotine-free diet. Thus, the processing of nicotine does not impose a significant metabolic cost on M. sexta larvae, and it is invalid to infer increased metabolic costs of detoxification from the observation of concomitant decreases in growth rate (GR or RGR) and the efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD) of larvae on toxin-containing diets.
   In a manner similar to nicotine, the growth-reducing effects of the nonhost plant toxins (xanthotoxin, precocene II, and canavanine) can be explained on the basis of their effects on consumption and the duration of the third instar. In no case is growth reduction a consequence of an increase in metabolic rate. Instead, reductions in growth result from the diversion of assimilate from growth to energy metabolism mandated by a longer instar, and from decreases in the size of the assimilate pool resulting from decreases in consumption and/or assimilation. Thus, the effects of allelochemicals on the energy budget of M. sexta result from their activity as metabolic toxins and feeding deterrents reducing rates of growth and consumption, and not from their diversion of energy from growth to allelochemical processing.
   We conclude that (1) the processing of host plant allelochemicals does not impose a significant energy demand on Manduca sexta and (2) the energy costs of allelochemical processing are unlikely either to constrain the expansion or to drive the contraction of the host plant range of M. sexta. Therefore, we suggest that the concept of metabolic load is not a useful one in understanding the effects of plant allelochemicals on the growth and efficiency of food utilization or in explaining the evolution of dietary specialization of lepidopteran herbivores.

AB Organismal movement is frequently treated as a diffusion process arising from a simple random walk in a spatially uniform environment. However, anomalous diffusion may arise due to: (1) intrinsic departures from random movements of individuals; or (2) the effects of barriers that impede, or corridors that facilitate, movement. We examine anomalous diffusion in field studies of Eleodes beetles (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) and in simulations of correlated random walks on maps of real and artificial landscapes. We show how diffusion alternates between ordinary and anomalous diffusion depending on movement rules, landscape pattern, and the spatial and temporal scales of observation. Recent theories of diffusion in spatially complex media predict power law relations for anomalous diffusion. Over time scales of 5-500 s, Eleodes exhibited power laws for: (1) mean squared displacement with time; and (2) the mean time to travel from the center to the perimeter of circles of various radii. In grasslands, diffusion exponents changed significantly at a radius of 42 cm, which characterized the size of grass and bare soil patches. A second change in diffusion at scales of 24-600 h characterized home range activity. Marked discrepancies between the dynamics of beetles in the field and in simulations suggest a need for more comprehensive models of individual movement that use different rules for various domains of space and time. Studies of anomalous diffusion identify the relative effects of environment vs. innate behavior and reveal a range of scales over which the effects pertain.

AB Most studies of feeding preferences of herbivores have focussed on the role of plant secondary metabolites; very few studies have experimentally tested the importance of plant toughness or calcification as feeding deterrents, although low preference has repeatedly been shown to correlate with these factors. Feeding preferences of the unusual generalist herbivore Dolabella auricularia, an opisthobranch gastropod which, like many other herbivores of that group, sequesters secondary metabolites from some algae, were consistent with our expectation that they might not feed on algae and seagrasses that were tough, calcified, or chemically rich. We experimentally examined the importance of each of these three features in deterring feeding by Dolabella.
   Consumption of plants by Dolabella was negatively correlated with plant toughness, as determined by penetrometer measurements. Given a choice between two species of plants, Dolabella always preferred the softer of the pair. However, when both species were ground up and incorporated into soft carrageenan cakes, Dolabella were significantly less selective in 3 of 4 cases where the tougher plant had no other known line of defense, and in 1 of 3 cases where the tougher plant also had chemical or CaCO3 defenses. Frondose calcified algae on Guam are greater-than-or-equal-to 50% CaCO3 by dry mass. CaCO3 deterred Dolabella feeding at concentrations of 28 and 50% of dry mass, but not at 16%. CaCO3 occurs in algae in two crystal structures, calcite and aragonite; both deterred Dolabella feeding. CaCO3 and chemical defenses of Halimeda macroloba did not interact synergistically to enhance effectiveness. Dolabella feeding was not deterred by organic extracts from most plants, even when offered at very high concentrations. Extracts from many of these plants had previously been shown to deter feeding by fishes at lower concentrations. Of the 12 plants tested, Dolabella feeding was deterred only by extracts from Caulerpa racemosa, Hormothamnion enteromorphoides, and Halimeda macroloba. We isolated and tested the two major metabolites of Caulerpa, caulerpenyne and caulerpin, and identified caulerpenyne as the deterrent agent.
   These results indicate that Dolabella are relatively unaffected by chemical defenses and yet are deterred by other plant defenses such as calcification and toughness. The fact that Dolabella can sequester algal secondary metabolites may explain Dolabella's relative indifference to chemically rich plant extracts.

AB Many populations are heterogeneous collections of different sizes or stages of conspecifics.  Existing overlap indices do not account for the size-/stage-structured nature of these populations.  In this paper I present new overlap indices that use information about the sizes of individuals that co-occur in time and space to predict the potential for interactions in size-structured guilds.  An index of the opportunity for competition (IOC) calculates the frequency with which similar size classes of two species encounter each other, whereas an index of the opportunity for intraguild predation (IOP) calculates the frequency of encounters among disparate size classes of the same two species.
   To illustrate that these indices are more appropriate for size-structured populations than conventional indices, I calculated overlap, IOP, and IOC for all species pairs in a diverse assemblage of dragonfly larvae.  The new indices revealed size-specific patterns of overlap that were not detected by the conventional index, including that (1) some species with high overlap values should interact mainly as competitors, others mainly as intraguild predators, and many as both competitors and predators, (2) subtle differences in phenology and/or size-specific shifts in habitat distribution can lead to the potential for asymmetric interspecific interactions, (3) some species with low pairwise IOP and IOC values are nonetheless vulnerable to the effects of diffuse competition or intraguild predation, (4) seasonal segregation reduces competitive overlap but at the same time increases the opportunity for intraguild predation.  The indices are general in form and should be useful for analyzing distributional data for any size-structured assemblage in which the type and intensity of interaction varies as a function of relative size.

AB The purpose of this study was to identify and quantify the demographic and genetic factors that favor long-term persistence of resident bird populations on small islands. Two species of Darwin's Ground Finches, Geospiza scandens (Cactus Finch) and G. fortis (Medium Ground Finch), were studied on Isla Daphne Major, Galapagos, from 1975 to 1991. Four cohorts born in the years 1975-1978 were followed to the point where almost every individual had died. Life tables were constructed from survival and reproductive data, and used to calculate genetically effective population sizes.
   Annual rainfall was highly variable and erratic. Extremes were 0 and 1359 mm. As a consequence the finch populations fluctuated in all demographic parameters. In years of little or no rainfall breeding did not occur, in years of abundant rainfall as many as eight breeding attempts were made by individual pairs. Maximum ages were 15 yr for G. scandens and 14 yr for G. fortis. Males of both species tended to live longer than females and to breed later; most females bred for the first time at ages 1-3 yr, whereas most males bred for the first time at ages 2-6 yr. An unusual feature of the survival and reproductive schedules is an increase in reproductive value sometimes occurring moderately late in life more than once, associated with occasional extremely favorable conditions for reproduction.
   Harmonic mean breeding population sizes (NBAR) were 94 G. scandens and 197 G. fortis. Effective population sizes (N(e)) were much lower, principally as a result of a large variance in the production of recruits per parent, especially by G. fortis. Average effective sizes were 38 G. scandens and 60 G. fortis by one method of calculation, and slightly larger by another. The proportional rate of loss of selectively neutral heterozygosity or additive genetic variance in quantitative traits potentially caused by random genetic drift (1/2N(e)) in these populations is approximately 0.003-0.005, or 0.3-0.5%/yr, and between 0.8 and 1.4% per generation. We suggest that a general estimate for the effective size of terrestrial bird populations is about one-quarter of average breeding numbers.
   These results are discussed in relation to the long-term viability of the populations and the maintenance of genetic variation. The demographic features that enable the finch species to persist in the face of extreme environmental stochasticity are a high maximum life-span, a generally high adult survival under the stressful conditions of drought, a flexible period of maturity, and a high reproductive rate. Despite their relatively small effective population sizes and the likelihood of genetic impoverishment through random drift they remain genetically variable through gene flow, principally hybridization.
   This study highlights fluctuating (unstable) age structures as a methodological constraint on some of the theoretical calculations. An expanded demographic and population-genetic theory is needed to overcome this constraint.

AB Male territorial behavior and female oviposition behavior of Megaloprepus coerulatus, a damselfly that develops in water-filled tree holes, is interpreted in light of its larval ecology. Sexual selection favors large males because they win more territorial contests than do smaller males, and females mate only in the vicinity of defended tree holes (i.e., passive female choice). Small males behave as territory holders until displaced, and/or act as subordinate satellites at large territories. Females are more predictably found in forest light gaps, even though they oviposit in both gap and understory tree holes. Males defended only 14% of the sites used by ovipositing females.
   Large tree holes are relatively rare, but support a greater number of emerging adults per season and produce larger adults than tree holes containing less-than-or-equal-to 1 L of water, which rarely produce more than one individual per season. By defending only large tree holes in gap areas, a male increases his chances of mating, and of producing multiple offspring and reproductively successful sons. Results from a field experiment suggest that both mate acquisition and procurement of superior larval habitats have been selective pressures in the evolution of male territory choice. Because even large holes are inadequate to support a female's entire clutch, and the presence of conspecific and heterospecific odonate larvae makes offspring survival uncertain, selection favors a female that partitions her clutch among multiple tree holes.

AB The clearwinged grasshopper, Camnula pellucida, exploits incident solar radiation to raise internal body temperatures above ambient levels. Under adequate temperature and light conditions, grasshopper body temperatures may exceed air temperatures by 10-degrees-15-degrees-C with both nymphs and adults preferring to thermoregulate near 40-degrees-C, their optimal temperature for development. Comparison of age-specific phenology data collected from field sites with projections from computer simulation studies on grasshopper development, indicated that incident solar radiation can highly accelerate maturation of grasshoppers. Also, prolonged exposure to temperatures above 35-degrees-C is beneficial to grasshoppers, as it is detrimental to the fungal pathogen Entomophaga grylli (US pathotype I), which is a major cause of natural mortality in many species. E. grylli protoplasts grew little or not at all if incubated at a constant 35-degrees-C in tissue culture medium. Studies, conducted in vivo at constant temperatures, verified that E. grylli has an upper thermal limit of survival and development near 35-degrees-C. In nature, however, these organisms are exposed to fluctuating temperatures. Further in vitro studies revealed that protoplast survival and development were significantly affected by incubation at 40-degrees-C for as little as 2 h per day and almost totally inhibited by 40-degrees-C for 8 h each day. In vivo incubation studies also showed an increase in the incubation period and a decline in the proportion of grasshoppers dying of E. grylli mycosis with increased daily exposure to 40-degrees-C. Infected grasshoppers were also held at 25-degrees-30-degrees-C and allowed to range freely between shaded and lighted areas, so body temperatures could be raised through normal basking activity. Compared to a control group held in diffuse light, E. grylli mycosis was almost totally eliminated from the basking grasshoppers. The few individuals treated with solar radiation that died from E. grylli infection survived significantly longer then infected individuals not exposed to the solar simulator. Computer simulations using field-collected temperature, moisture, and solar radiation data revealed that behaviorally regulated thermal effects on E. grylli survival and development could limit disease development in some locations and seasons. Although it is unclear that the behavioral trait of basking is an adaptive response to selection pressures caused either by the pathogen or by other selective factors, it is clear that thermoregulatory behavior provides survival advantages to C pellucida. In addition to their specific biological significance, these results demonstrate that behavioral exploitation of a physical resource in the environment can be used to profoundly alter biological relationships between species, in this case, allowing one organism to eliminate an antagonist by causing its mortality.

AB Effects of herbivore density on parasitization, bird predation, and interference between parasitoids and predators were tested using midge gall clusters of Giraudiella inclusa (Diptera, Cecidomyiidae) from Phragmites habitats. Winter predation of Blue Tits (Parus caeruleus) did not simply cause an additional mortality of midge larvae, but affected both midge and parasitoid species.
   Fifty-six percent of galls were parasitized, so that the average of 70% gall predation resulted in only 30% additional midge mortality. Out of the eight frequent parasitoid species, two showed positive density-dependent responses, two showed negative density-dependent responses, and four showed density-independent responses. However, in aggregate, percent parasitism was density independent.
   Birds preferentially pecked open large gall clusters and thereby caused a particularly high mortality of parasitoid species concentrated in large clusters. Selection pressure by birds against parasitoids with density-dependent responses suppressed the parasitoids' presumed ability to regulate host populations and probably altered parasitoid coexistence.
   Host plant characteristics affected distribution and abundance of galls, and also the subsequent pattern of parasitization and the percentage of bird predation. Such four-trophic-level cascade effects can be complex: shoot damage by stem-boring caterpillars induced side shoots, thereby increasing gall abundance and facilitating the inverse density-dependent endoparasitoid Aprostocetus gratus, since (1) gall clusters of side shoots were very small (enhancing percent parasitism), and (2) these small gall clusters were little preyed upon by birds.

AB Actual food-web structure or function is difficult to determine based on visual observation, gut analyses, or the feeding interactions expected from a given list of species.  We used C and N stable-isotope distributions to define food-web structure in arctic lakes, and we compared that structure with results based on more traditional analyses.  Although zooplankton species composition was similar across the eight lakes studied, the food-web structure varied greatly.  In some lakes the copepod predator Heterocope fed on the herbivorous copepod Diaptomus as expected in a conventional food web.  In most lakes, however, delta-N-15 data were consistent with Heterocope functioning as an herbivore rather than a predator.  These inferences were supported by evidence from carbon isotopes and energy-flow data.  Our study indicates that only two or three trophic levels exist in the macrozooplankton of these lakes, in comparison to five or six trophic levels reported in temperate lakes.  Isotope analyses showed that actual food-web structure is poorly predicted from simple consideration of species lists and potential trophic interactions.

AB Seed production is usually assumed to be a positive monotonic function of pollen deposition and/or pollinator visitation.  If this assumption were correct, there would be only two outcomes of excess pollen levels:  an increase in fruit or seed set, or no increase.  However, a substantial minority of the studies reviewed here has found that seed production declines with increased pollen loads, both under experimental and natural conditions.  To explain this decrease, we propose the following mechanisms:  pollen tube crowding, pollen removal or stigma damage by pollen thieves or pollinators, stigma damage during hand-pollination, application of low-diversity or local pollen, effects of bagging flowers, missed stigma receptivity, and the application of inviable pollen.  These mechanisms can be distinguished through more complete and more careful experimental designs and incremental pollen supplementation.

AB Two of the central hypotheses of the triangular model of primary plant strategies were tested by a novel technique involving seven grasses of contrasted ecology grown in pure stands and an additive mixture on an experimental matrix of crossed gradients of mineral nutrient stress and vegetation disturbance. The experimental design allowed reductions in vegetative and reproductive vigor resulting from interspecific competition to be distinguished from those arising from direct effects of nutrient stress and vegetation disturbance. It was also possible to determine the extent to which competitive suppression of each species was affected by stress and disturbance.
   In isolation, all species showed maximum vegetative and reproductive vigor at high soil fertility and low disturbance. In the mixture, absolute reductions in biomass and flowering due to competition were greatest at high soil fertility and low disturbance, and the species of most extreme strategy became restricted to areas of the matrix broadly consistent with those predicted by strategy classification. When standardized for differences in biomass in pure stands, the effect of competition remained relatively constant across the stress-disturbance matrix for all species except Poa annua, which was less restricted by competition at high intensities of stress. There were marked and consistent differences between species in their susceptibility to competition. At both high and low soil fertility, two species of natural occurrence on infertile soils (Festuca ovina, Bromus erectus) were poor competitors relative to Arrhenatherum elatius, a widespread dominant of productive grasslands. The effect of competition was least severe on flowering of annuals in low-stress portions of the matrix. If competition is assessed simply as the percentage of reduction in biomass between pure and mixed stands it appears that competition intensity is constant across different intensities of stress and disturbance. However, observations that maximum reductions in biomass coincided with low stress and low disturbance, that competition decreased in importance as a factor reducing yield and flowering (relative to stress and disturbance) as stress and disturbance intensities increased, and that there was a consistently inferior competitive ability of plants from infertile soils at all positions on the matrix all support the hypothesis that competition declines in importance as a vegetation determinant in the vegetation of infertile soils.

AB A factorial experiment was performed to evaluate the relationships between defoliation and canopy closure, recognizing that a major effect of grazing in nature is to prevent that closure. Short (Eustachys paspaloides) and mid-height (Themeda triandra) grasses from the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, were grown for 12 wk in a balanced factorial experiment. Treatments combined clipping and canopy closure, simulated by raising an opaque cardboard collar as plant height increased. At harvest, plants were separated into morphological parts, dried, weighed, and analyzed for nitrogen (N) and nonstructural carbohydrates (CHO). Simulated canopy closure of unclipped plants reduced photon flux density at the plant base by 12% perpendicular to the light source and 55% at a 45-degrees- angle from the lights. Multivariate analysis revealed that experimental treatments produced completely distinct results. Simulated canopy closure of undefoliated plants more than doubled plant height, reduced tiller number by 65% in the short grass and 90% in the mid-height grass, converted differentiation from production of many small tillers to a few very large tillers, changed allocation patterns toward more stem and sheath, and shifted the short grass from a CHO-dominated economy to a more N-balanced economy. The time course of yield from defoliation reached a decided. maximum at 9 wk in the short grass but was much lower and remained comparatively constant in the mid-height grass. Comparing clipped-unshaded plants (simulating grazing) with unclipped-shaded plants (simulating no grazing) revealed that, for both grasses, compensation for defoliation was complete in total yield, yield of live tissues, crown mass, root mass, and total number of leaves. Neither species compensated in residual leaf mass, total leaf area, leaf area per unit of plant biomass, or stem mass. Defoliation shifted leaves of both species to lower CHO and higher N concentrations. In general, the short grass was modified more by canopy closure, the mid-height species by clipping. Greater defoliation tolerance of the short-statured species was due to much greater tillering, significantly greater N accumulation, greater allocation to leaf blade and sheath, less allocation to crown and root, a greater foliage concentration per unit canopy volume, a lower rate of foliage death, and the ability to sustain a considerably higher leaf area per unit of plant mass.
   This experiment indicated that growing unclipped plants isolated in pots grossly distorts morphology, growth, and chemical properties compared to plants experiencing the canopy closure normally encountered in ungrazed grasslands. Therefore, failure to account for the self-limiting consequences of canopy closure can mislead conclusions from laboratory experiments designed to test the consequences of defoliation.

AB This study examines flower choice by two syntopic butterfly species, Agraulis vanillae (Nymphalidae) and Phoebis sennae (Pieridae), and the energy consequences of foraging selectivity. Foraging selectivity is influenced by proboscis length; because the proboscis of P. sennae is approximately 1 cm longer than that of A. vanillae, it is able to forage at long-corolla flowers (three Ipomoea spp.) inaccessible to A. vanillae. Relative to other nectar sources exploited by the two species, these Ipomoea species are highly rewarding energetically. Phoebis sennae increases its energy intake relative to A. vanillae by exercising greater discrimination between high- and low-reward nectar sources, avoiding several species with small nectar volumes that are avidly visited by A. vanillae. Consequently, the average foraging profit of P. sennae is nearly 4 times that of A. vanillae. These differences in foraging selectivity and energy intake are closely related to energy storage and depletion rates, measured as age-related changes in gross lipid contents of adult butterflies. Adult activities in the less selective species, A. vanillae, are fueled to a greater degree with lipid reserves set aside at metamorphosis; A. vanillae emerge from pupae with 13-16% of dry mass allocated to lipids, and these lipid stores decline at a variable rate throughout adult life. By contrast, in P. sennae lipid accumulated from adult feeding provides the largest proportion of energy stores. P. sennae emerge from the pupa with only 6% of the dry mass allocated to lipids, and accumulate lipid stores to levels as high as 40% of dry mass through most of adult life, depleting these lipid reserves only in late adulthood. Further, A. vanillae show significant sexual dimorphism in lipid content throughout life, with females containing greater quantities, while P. sennae show no such dimorphism. These results are discussed with respect to Boggs' model concerning the allocation of larval-derived resources to reproduction.

AB We examined a chronosequence of subalpine lodgepole pine stands to test the hypothesis that low net primary production in older forest stands is caused by higher maintenance respiration costs of woody tissues. We predicted that respiration of woody tissues (particularly stem sapwood) would be greater in older stands and that the higher maintenance costs would account for observed low wood production. For a unit of ground surface, the carbon flux involved in wood production and associated construction respiration was 210 g-m 2-yr-1 in a 40-yr-old stand, but declined to 46 g.m-2.yr-1 in a 245-yr-old stand. However, maintenance respiration of woody tissues in stems and branches consumed only 61 g.M-2.yr-1 in the 40-yr-old stand and 79 g.M-2.yr-1 in the 245-yr-old stand. The slight, nonsignificant increase in maintenance respiration of woody tissues could not explain the dramatic decline in aboveground wood production in the old-growth stand.

AB The dynamics of the interaction of populations of Bacillus subtilis and a temperate bacteriophage in soil microorganisms were examined. The purpose of the study was to investigate these dynamics in a structured habitat approaching that of their natural habitat in soil, in contrast to previous investigations in broth or chemostats. We addressed three main questions. What are the population dynamics of a phage-bacteria interaction in soil? What role might the heterogeneity of the soil play in shaping the interaction? Are the dynamics controlled more by the population biology of the phage or of the bacteria?
   The phage used was isolated from Arizona desert soil in which B. subtilis is common. Phage and bacteria were grown separately or together in sterile soil microcosms consisting of autoclaved soil rich in organic material. Densities of phage and bacteria were estimated through repeated sterile sampling of the microcosms by spreading precise dilutions of sampled soil suspensions onto plates of microbiological media. The plates for estimation of phage densities contained in addition a lawn of host bacteria. While the principal focus is on temperate phage ecology, the dynamics of a single example of interaction between B. subtilis and virulent phage is also presented. In all cases an initial epidemic of phage occurred, followed by stable equilibria lasting weeks to months. A threshold host density for phage outbreak occurs at almost-equal-to 5 x 10(6) colony-forming units per gram of soil. At equilibrium the phage, both temperate and virulent, were much less abundant than the bacteria. The temperate phage did not depress the equilibrium host density, while the virulent phage lowered it by a factor of ten. The acidic soil of these experiments caused rapid and permanent inactivation of free phage, making the continuous interaction of phage and host essential for persistence of phage. Low levels of phage resistance (superimmunity or genetic) were typical of host populations.
   Most properties of the interaction between B. subtilis and phage in soil are quite different from those observed with chemostat populations of Escherichia coli and virulent phages. Potential doubling times and rates of increase in soil for phage and B. subtilis were calculated. At equilibrium, soil slows the interaction of phage and host relative to population growth in broth culture, and possibly also makes it heterogeneous in space and time. The life-history features of B. subtilis and temperate phage are considerably more complex than those of non-sporeforming bacteria and virulent phage. The biotic relationship of temperate phage and host may be distinct from predation or parasitism. Patterns in the ecology and evolution of temperate and virulent phage were explored, leading to the expectation that temperate forms will be more common among the phages of soil bacteria.

AB The distance over which propagules can successfully colonize new sites depends on processes that increase the time they remain competent while being dispersed. As do feeding larvae, algal spores can contribute to their own nutrition (via photosynthesis) during dispersal. We explored the dispersal potential of the kelps Macrocystis pyrifera and Pterygophora californica in laboratory experiments by examining (1) how long their spores can swim, (2) the contribution of energy derived from photosynthesis to spore swimming duration, and (3) the ability of spores to germinate and attach after they stop swimming. Results indicate that under photosynthetically saturating irradiance no spores of either species can swim longer than 120 h; < 10% of the spores were still swimming after 72 h. When placed in the dark, spores did not swim longer than 72 h; < 10% remained swimming after 48 h. More importantly, spores did not die after they stopped swimming; most germinated in the water column and retained their capacity to produce viable sporophyte recruits. The ability of spores to attach after they stopped swimming differed between the two species; settlement density declined in Macrocystis and increased in Pterygophora. Thus, the viable planktonic stage of these algae is not necessarily restricted to the spore but may include later life history stages. These results provide biological evidence that the spores and germlings of these kelps can remain competent in the plankton for extended periods of time, which is consistent with our previous findings that their dispersal can occur over greater distances than previously thought possible.

AB Very little is known about the demography in size-structured seaweed populations, and this is especially true for populations in variable environments.  Thus, the demography of the brown alga Ascophyllum nodosum was analyzed with a matrix population model.  This was built on a 3-yr study in two populations on the Swedish west coast, where > 1100 individuals were marked and followed twice each year.  The environmental variability is due to the presence of ice during some of the winters.  The frequency of ice years in the study area is known, and is higher at one site compared to the other.  During the study there were 2 yr with ice and one without at both sites, and these temporal changes in the environment resulted in large variations in the vital rates of A. nodosum.  The individuals were divided into five size classes and the population dynamics at years without ice were characterized by low mortality rates and high transition probabilities for growth to larger sizes, while years with ice had high mortality rates and high transition probabilities for breakage to smaller sizes.  Of the 25 possible transitions in the life cycle graph all except 2 had nonzero entries, which means that the adult life of A. nodosum individuals can be described as plastic growth between all five size classes.  A crude estimate of the recruitment showed that both populations will increase in numbers in ice-free years, but will decrease in years with ice.  The size-dependent fertility rate is probably subject to errors, and thus the survival matrices were scaled with a fertility function built on total reproductive biomass per individual, allowing analyses of the demography at different levels of the asymptotic growth rate lambda(1).  One of the main differences between the populations was that the stable size distribution for survival matrices in ice-free years was dominated by size class 4 at one population but class 5 at the other.  Thus, to achieve the same value of lambda(1) higher fertility rates were needed at the population dominated by class 4.  Elasticity analysis of the transition matrices showed the same trend, although the main result from that analysis was that growth to larger sizes or remaining in the same class contributed more to lambda(1) than reproduction.  This was valid for all levels of lambda(1) investigated.

AB I experimentally manipulated avian predation pressure in an intertidal community to determine its direct and indirect influence on the abundance and distribution of three limpets and their algal food source. Birds reduced the overall abundance of Lottia digitalis only; L. strigatella abundance increased and the abundance of L. pelta, the species most frequently consumed, did not change. Through crypsis, the goose barnacle Pollicipes polymerus and the mussel Mytilus californianus indirectly affected the abundance of L. digitalis and L. pelta in opposite ways by changing their risk of succumbing to bird predation. These limpets also exhibited strong habitat selection for their cryptic substrates. By altering the amount of preferred habitat, birds indirectly influenced limpet abundance: gull predation reduced the area covered by P. polymerus, releasing M. californianus from space competition. By consuming limpet grazers and reducing space competition, birds indirectly enhanced the abundance of algae. L. strigatella sizes generally fell below the range of limpet sizes consumed by birds. Consequently, birds indirectly increased L. strigatella density by reducing the intensity of exploitative competition with other limpet species; L. strigatella biomass declined significantly with increasing biomass of the other two limpets, and with decreasing algal cover. These results demonstrate that indirect effects and apparently adaptive behaviors can counteract (or reinforce) direct interactions between species pairs, suggesting that conclusions from short-term experiments emphasizing species pairs can be tenuous.

AB We examined whether larval and adult behavior, physiology, and chemical defense were altered as a result of host range expansion by the Baltimore checkerspot (Euphydryas phaeton, Nymphalidae) from the native host plant, turtlehead (Chelone glabra, Scrophulariaceae), to the introduced weed, plantain (Plantago lanceolata, Plantaginaceae).  We found that newly hatched larvae from eggs collected from a population using plantain were heavier than those from a population using turtlehead.  Nonetheless, both the prediapause and postdiapause larvae derived from the turtlehead population and fed turtlehead in a laboratory experiment gained more mass than those from the plantain population fed plantain.  Collections of diapausing larvae from field sites corroborated that pattern.  Regardless of the population source (i.e., those using either turtlehead or plantain), postdiapause larvae reared on turtlehead exhibited higher relative growth rate (RGR), efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI), and efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD) than those fed plantain, even though approximate digestibility (AD) and leaf nitrogen concentrations were lower for turtlehead.  Regardless of their population of origin, choice tests showed that newly hatched larvae preferred turtlehead.  Likewise, adult females reared from larvae collected from both populations oviposited exclusively on turtlehead.  Both C. glabra and P. lanceolata contain iridoid glycosides.  The iridoid glycoside profile of butterflies reared on these two plants differed, reflecting the differences of the host plants.  The shift of some populations of E. phaeton onto plantain is most likely a function of several ecological factors rather than genetic differentiation between populations using turtlehead and plantain.

AB Sea otters (Enhydra lutris), well documented as "keystone" predators in rocky marine communities, were found to exert a strong influence on infaunal prey communities in soft-sediment habitats.  Direct and indirect effects of sea otter predation on subtidal soft-bottom prey communities were evaluated along a temporal gradient of sea otter occupancy around the Kodiak Archipelago.  The results indicate that Kodiak otters forage primarily on bivalve prey and dramatically reduce infaunal bivalve and green sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) prey populations.  Bivalve prey abundance, biomass, and size were inversely related to duration of sea otter occupancy.  The relative conditions of shells discarded by otters in shallow (< 10 m) vs. deep (> 20 m) water at the same sites indicate that otters first exploited Saxidomus in shallow-water feeding areas, and later switched to Macoma spp. in deeper water.  Otter-cracked shells of the deep-burrowing clam Tresus capax were rarely found, even at otter foraging sites where the clam accounted for the majority of available prey biomass, suggesting that it has a partial depth refuge from otter predation.
   The indirect effects of otter predation included substratum disturbance and the facilitation of sea star predation on infaunal prey.  Sea stars, Pycnopodia helianthoides, were attracted to experimentally dug excavations as well as natural sea otter foraging pits, where the sea stars foraged on smaller size classes of infaunal bivalves than those eaten by otters.  Otters also discard clam shells on the sediment surface and expose old, buried shells during excavation.  Surface shells were found to provide attachment sites for large anemones and kelp.  Our study shows that sea otters can affect soft-sediment communities, not only through predation, as in rocky habitats, but also through disturbance, and thus retain a high degree of influence in two very different habitat types.

AB The method and the associated graphical representations proposed in this paper facilitate the interpretation of the correspondence analysis (CA) of a samples/species data table. By using the "reciprocal discrimination" model of CA, this method introduces directly and on the same graph the notions of niche width and within-sample diversity. We propose two Macintosh programs for computing conditional means, variances, and covariances of factor scores for species and samples, and for drawing ellipses and Gaussian curves from these values. Two examples of ecological interest show how resulting graphics help in understanding the results of multivariate analyses.

AB Assimilation of soil organic matter and fresh plant debris by Millsonia anomala, a tropical geophagous earthworm, was investigated by measuring changes in the C-13/C-12 ratio of their tissues when fed on organic matter naturally labelled by C-13. Individuals collected from a soil colonized by C4 plants (C4 soil) that were fed on C3 soil had > 50% of tissue C derived from the C3 Soil after 33 d. Assimilation of organic matter associated with different particle size fractions was investigated with individuals fed for 25 d on C4 soil with C4 particle size fractions substituted in turn for the equivalent C3 soil particle fraction. A significant labelling of earthworms was observed with both the 250-2000-mu-m and the 0-20-mu-m particle size fractions. Addition of fresh C3 plant debris to the C4 soil also resulted in a significant change in earthworm C isotope ratio. Assimilation of fresh plant material was greater than that of soil organic matter. This shows that young M. anomala are able to assimilate young organic matter (fresh plant debris, coarse soil organic matter) as well as fine soil organic matter, both of which classically have been regarded as strongly resistant to decomposition in models of soil organic matter dynamics.

AB Ratio-dependent models of predators and prey are approximations of the biology of resource acquisition and allocation and their consequences for population birth and death rates. A demand-driven functional response model that has a physiological basis in mass (energy) dynamics is reviewed (i.e., the metabolic pool model), and its obvious links to the logistic model are outlined.
   To demonstrate the utility of this approach, a distributed maturation time age-structure model of the dynamics of A. J. Nicholson's classic laboratory population data on the sheep blow fly (Lucilia cuprina Weidman) is developed. The model provides sufficient information on the dynamics of the intermediate life stages to show that the blow fly oscillations were due to the effects of larval competition for food on size, fecundity, and pupation success. These results agree with Nicholson's conclusions. The advantage of this model, in contrast to prior models, is that the dynamics emerge by considering the processes of resource acquisition and allocation as they affect growth, reproduction, and survival. No explicit time delays, which automatically lead to oscillations, were included. Lastly, the notions of the metabolic pool model are found in Nicholson's original model for equilibrium population density.
   The metabolic pool paradigm in an age-structure setting is used to model the tri-trophic dynamics of Acyrthosiphon aphids in an alfalfa ecosystem. The model explains the role of the various natural enemies in the regulation of the aphids.

AB In this paper we present a simple model of multiple-element limitation of plant production and biomass accumulation. The primary aim of this model is to develop a theoretical framework for examining multiple-element limitation vs. single-element limitation and for examining the relationship between short-term and long-term responses to changes in element availability. In the model we assume that there is an "optimal" ratio of mineral elements in vegetation biomass, and that the vegetation continually adjusts its relative element uptake capacities to compensate for shifts away from this optimum. We examine the responses of this model to changes in element availability in the plant environment, where "availability" is defined either as fixed concentrations of non-depletable elements or as fixed replenishment rates of depletable elements.
   The model results suggest that the nature of the controls on element availability has a major impact on whether single- or multiple-element limitation prevails, even when plants can acclimate so as to maintain an "optimal" nutritional balance. Single-element limitation occurs when the replenishment rate of an essential element to the available pool is limited and sustainable plant uptake of that element equals the replenishment rate. Furthermore, when single-element limitation prevails, there is little or no correlation between short-term responses to a change in element availability and long-term, equilibrium responses.
   In general, previous experimental studies and models of plant growth in response to changes in relative availability of multiple, essential elements have either not specified how those resources are controlled, or have examined only one type of control. Our results help to explain the diversity of results of past studies of multiple-element limitation, suggest some improvements in experimental design for future studies, and have important implications for the extrapolation of the results of controlled experiments to field situations.

AB Classical models describing the number of prey consumed by predators rest on an analogy with the law of mass action and, consequently, the functional response of predators depends only on the density of prey. An alternative model is that the functional response depends on the ratio of prey and predator densities. We hypothesize that the applicability of one or the other model depends on the degree of heterogeneity of predators and prey in space, the prey-dependent model being appropriate in homogeneous situations while the ratio-dependent model is appropriate in heterogeneous situations. We have designed experiments to test this hypothesis, using cladocerans filter-feeding on algae. The design is such that the two types of dependence can be discriminated by observation of equilibrium patterns. Daphnia magna and Simocephalus vetulus, the two cladoceran species tested, differ in their spatial distributions. Daphnia has homogeneous distribution whereas Simocephalus has heterogeneous distribution. Experimental results support the hypothesis: D. magna follows the prey-dependent model and S. vetulus follows the ratio-dependent model. By artificially modifying the environment of the two species, we forced D. magna to a heterogeneous distribution and S. vetulus to a homogeneous distribution. As a consequence, each species changed its dependence, further confirming our hypothesis.

AB Resources, pollen, and predation limit fruit and seed set in Lathyrus vernus. Removal of flowers increased fruit and seed set among remaining ovaries and ovules, but did not affect seed mass. The distributions of the increased fruit and seed set among remaining ovaries indicated specific and variable patterns of translocation.
   The importance of pollen relative to resource deficiency varied between two experimental seasons, among individuals, and among flowers within shoots. Pollen supplementation increased fruit and seed set in one of two experimental seasons. When shoots were supplied with extra pollen a greater proportion produced fruits, but the number of fruits per fruit-producing shoot did not increase. Differences in fruit set among flowers with different phenology and different position within inflorescences persisted also among pollen-supplemented flowers. Furthermore, while pollen availability sometimes may limit fruit initiation, maturation seems to be limited primarily by resources. Genets that received supplementary pollen in 1988 produced fewer flowers in 1989, indicating that long-term fecundity is not necessarily pollen limited.                                       Lastly, exclusion of the main ovary predators increased fruit set.

AB I present a model predicting the distribution and abundance of two species of competing nectarivore exploiting nectar in two types of flower. The model uses a submodel of resource renewal and depletion, and the principle that individuals attempt to maximize individual fitness, to construct habitat isolines. The habitat isoline for a population of nectarivores is a line in an abundance phase-plane along which all individuals of the population, regardless of the habitat they are currently exploiting, have equal expected fitness. At equilibrium the habitat isoline determines the distribution of a population between two habitats given a fixed abundance of competitors. The habitat isolines for populations of two species exploiting two habitats can be used to predict the equilibrium distribution of both species. I illustrate the model using data about bumble bees foraging for nectar in flowers (Inouye 1978).
   An asset of the model is its ability to make a priori predictions about flower exploitation patterns using information about resource dynamics and the foraging abilities of the nectarivores.
   Two warnings regarding the empirical detection of exploitation competition between species emerge from the model analysis. Depending on the range over which density manipulations are carried out in exploitation competition systems, competition may or may not be detected, while interspecific competition may or may not appear to be more intense than intraspecific competition.
   Although the model is directed at nectarivores competing for nectar in flowers, the results have wider implications for all systems where species compete exploitatively for resources.

AB Previous experiments have shown that for a specific experimental system of guppies (Poecilia reticulata), per capita growth rate is linearly related to population biomass. A length-specific population model is developed to examine how the various mechanisms of density dependence (i.e., changes in somatic growth rates, reproductive rates, and cannibalism) act in concert to shape the overall population response to intraspecific competition. Despite many nonlinear components, equilibrium per capita growth in the model is linearly related to population biomass, mimicking the logistic growth seen in the experiment. Using the model, the components of density dependence are varied to determine how each component shapes the overall density-dependent response. Density dependence in somatic growth rates is found to be the most important population-regulating mechanism in this system. In the past, emphasis has been placed on density dependence in birth and death functions. The importance of somatic growth in shaping per capita population growth curves may be underestimated.

AB Leach's Storm-Petrels (Oceanodroma leucorhoa), the smallest and most abundant seabirds that breed in the northwest Atlantic, are not usually included in avian energetics models. To round out an energy analysis of seabirds spanning the full range of body sizes in the northwest Atlantic, the field metabolic rates (FMRs) of breeding Leach's Storm-Petrels were measured using doubly labeled water techniques (DLW). Metabolic, dietary and, demographic data were used as inputs in a populations energetics model to estimate the energy requirements and prey harvests of the Leach's Storm-Petrel population of eastern North America.
   FMRs of storm-petrels that remained in burrows averaged 83.3 +/- 19.4 kJ/d. FMRs increased significantly with time (i.e., x in hours per day) at sea (y = [85.8 +/- 6.5] + [3.13 +/- 0.48]x), and metabolism at sea was estimated to be 161 +/- 18 kJ/d. FMRs integrated over activity on land and activity at sea averaged 124 kJ/d during incubation and 142 kJ/d during chick rearing. Incubating adults weighed significantly more than adults rearing chicks, although adult mass did not vary with age of chick. Basal metabolic rate (BMR, measured as O2 flux) averaged 2.02 +/- 1.01 cm3.g-1.h-1, equivalent to 45.4 +/- 30.4 kJ/d, very similar to values obtained for breeding conspecifics in the Bay of Fundy and in the Bering Sea. Thermal conductance averaged 0.124 +/- 0.065 cm3.g-1.h-1.degrees-C-1. FMR/BMR ratios averaged 2.73 for incubating birds and 3.13 for birds rearing young. Population energetics modelling indicated that during a 7-mo breeding period Leach's Storm-Petrels at colonies in the northwest Atlantic Ocean consume > 74000 Mg of prey, mostly myctophids and amphipods (mostly Hyperia galba), as well as euphausiids (mostly Meganyctiphanes norvegica) and other prey (decapods, copepods, isopods). Leach's Storm-Petrels make up approximately 80% of the breeding seabird population in eastern Canada, but owing to small body size and metabolic efficiency, they account for comparatively little of the energy that flows through the avian assemblage of the northwest Atlantic.
   An intra-specific, inter-colony difference in FMR is suggested: FMRs measured in a Newfoundland colony were significantly higher than those determined with the same DLW procedure in the Bay of Fundy near the southern limit of the species' breeding range in the northwest Atlantic. Differences in ambient temperatures and wind speed associated with different oceanographic regimes may generate energetic differences. Like inter-colony differences in feeding ecology, inter-colony differences in FMR need to be considered in population and community energetics models and in meso- and mega-scale extrapolations.

AB Adaptation of plant populations to nutrient-poor environments may follow two essentially different pathways: maximizing the assimilation of nutrients or minimizing the loss of nutrients. Our hypothesis was that plant species that are adapted to nutrient-poor soils can replace species that are characteristic for relatively nutrient-rich habitats by features that enable them to restrict their nutrient losses. We chose Festuca rubra and Arrhenatherum elatius as species to test this hypothesis. In a long-term field experiment in a hayfield it was observed that Festuca was very common and Arrhenatherum was almost absent in the unfertilized plots, whereas after fertilization Festuca disappeared and Arrhenatherum increased strongly. It was hypothesized that differences in nutrient and carbon losses resulting from mowing were responsible for the different success of the two species in the unfertilized plots. A pot experiment was carried out in a greenhouse with clipped and unclipped and with unfertilized and fertilized treatments in a factorial design with four series. In the fertilized treatments Arrhenatherum replaced Festuca; its heavier seeds resulted in more rapid early growth and its more erect architecture enabled it to overtop Festuca after some time. In the two unfertilized treatments Festuca replaced Arrhenatherum, but much more rapidly in the clipped pots than in the unclipped ones. Losses of nitrogen due to clipping were much greater in Arrhenatherum than in Festuca because of the strongly increased allocation of nitrogen to aboveground parts in Arrhenatherum in response to clipping. It was concluded that differences in nitrogen loss resulting from clipping have an important impact upon the competitive balance between plant species under nutrient-poor conditions.

AB Foraging behavior and physiological adaptations for diving were studied in Thick-billed Murres, Uria lomvia, in the field and laboratory. Electronic, light-emitting diode, and capillary recording devices were used to measure foraging behavior. Individual dives were a flattened U shape in profile, and occurred in bouts lasting almost-equal-to 15 min. Dive patterns were nocturnal; most dives occurred between 2000 and 0400. Murres probably concentrate their foraging effort at times when prey is most available as it migrates closer to the surface in the evening as part of the deep scattering layer. Although dives averaged 18 m in depth and 55 s in duration, most time-at-depth was spent between 21 and 40 m. Thus, murres made a large number of shallow, short-duration dives. Maximum dive depth was 210 m, while maximum dive duration was 224 s. Descent and ascent rates averaged 0.94 and 0.85 m/s, respectively. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, blood volume, and pectoralis myoglobin levels were measured in the laboratory as 52.8%, 18.0 g/100 mL, 12.3% body mass, and 1.9 g/100 g, respectively. Total useable oxygen store was calculated as 44.8 mL/kg, giving an estimated aerobic dive limit (ADL) of 47 s. Murres exceeded the calculated ADL in 48% of their dives. Long-duration diving is probably a more efficient foraging strategy for murres given their relatively small size and limited oxygen storage capabilities. The observed dive depths raised questions of potential problems with decompression sickness (bends) and lung collapse.

AB Net-spinning caddisfly larvae of the family Hydropsychidae are known to prefer microhabitats with large, stable substrate and high water flow velocity. It is often assumed that net spinners in high-velocity microhabitats have higher feeding or growth rates than larvae in less preferred sites, but there is no direct evidence to support this assumption. We hypothesized that net-spinning caddisflies would select microhabitats that offered the greatest feeding rates. This hypothesis was tested by field experiments in which we determined if net-spinning caddisfly larvae preferred high-velocity sites even when substrate size and type were held constant. We then measured feeding rates of net spinners in microhabitats with different flow characteristics. High-flow positions were selected by 96% of hydropsychid larvae colonizing artificial moss substrates. Artemia nauplii released into the water column were captured by individual larvae in high-flow sites at a rate of 0.016%/m, significantly higher than the capture rate in low-flow sites. Combining this rate of prey capture with mean hydropsychid densities of 1125 individuals/m2, we estimate that hydropsychid larvae in riffles remove drifting invertebrate prey at a rate of almost-equal-to 18%/m. Assuming exponential prey removal, a prey item in the drift would travel an average of only 5.5 m before being consumed. This study is one of the first to show that the distribution of a stream filter feeder is related to the feeding rates obtainable in different microhabitats.

AB The presence of leaf litter of different depths within a tropical forest creates many different microsites for plant establishment. The amount and distribution of leaf litter within a forest can influence patterns of plant establishment. In this study, we determined the spatial variability in leaf litter in the forest understory, and investigated how different litter depths (bare, 1, 6, and 12 cm) affected the establishment of several tropical tree species in both growth house (sun and shade) and field (gap and understory) experiments in the semideciduous tropical forest of Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The tree species used in this study (Aspidospermum cruenta, Ceiba pentandra, Cordia alliodora, Gustavia superba, Luehea seemannii, Ochroma pyrimidale) were chosen to represent a range of seed masses and a gradient in the light requirement for establishment of the species.
   The spatial distribution of leaf litter was not correlated between adjacent sampling points within the forest understory, suggesting that the establishment environment for seedlings, with respect to litter, is highly variable at scales of 1-20 m.
   The presence of litter affected five of the six species, but the nature and the magnitude of the effect were species specific. The smaller seeded shade-intolerant species had fewer seedlings establishing under leaf litter than on bare ground.The species ranged from strongly negatively affected (Luehea) to moderately negatively affected (Cordia, Ochroma) to affected only by extreme amounts of litter (Ceiba). The presence of litter influenced Gustavia, one of the larger seeded shade-tolerant species, but did not affect Aspidospermum, the other larger seeded species. The effect of litter on Gustavia depended on the light environment. Gustavia had more seedlings establishing under litter in the sun, but the presence of litter had no effect in the shade. Differences among the smaller seeded shade-intolerant species in the amount they were negatively influenced by litter were not correlated with seed mass.
   Data from our field study were consistent with our growth house results for the shade-intolerant species. Additional data from the field study indicated that these species with similar habitat requirements differed in the developmental stage at which they were affected by the presence of litter. Luehea had fewer seeds germinating under litter while the other two species, Ochroma and Cordia, were affected only after germination.
   Interspecific comparisons done for each light level and litter depth indicated that the presence of litter caused reversals in the relative ranking of species success. For example, Gustavia preferentially established under relatively deep litter depths in the sun where Luehea could not establish. In conclusion, the presence of litter can potentially increase seedling diversity within the forest by creating heterogeneity in the establishment environment and by causing reversals in species' rankings.

AB Studies of natural and simulated herbivory were conducted to assess the effects of secondary herbivory and plant association on the reproductive success of Ipomopsis aggregata. Over the 5-yr period of this study 77% of all plants were browsed by ungulate herbivores at some time during the flowering season. Of these, 33% were subsequently browsed. Removal of the single inflorescence stimulated the production of, on average, five new flowering stalks from dormant lateral buds along the remaining portion of the plant's stem. Although regrowth shoots were initially avoided by ungulates following the removal of scarlet gilia's single inflorescence, plant tips were secondarily browsed following stem elongation and flower bud formation.
   Secondary herbivory had no effect on the compensatory outcome. Plants that were naturally browsed produced significantly higher numbers of flowers and fruits than plants that were not eaten, even when plants were secondarily browsed. Because there were no significant differences in numbers of seeds produced per fruit or in seed mass, an increase in total fruits produced by browsed plants resulted in an increase in fitness through seed production.
   Observational and experimental results indicate that I. aggregata switches from a "mutualistic" to an "antagonistic" interaction with its ungulate herbivores in order to achieve its greatest fitness. Results of experimental clipping showed that high levels of secondary herbivory on I. aggregata would be detrimental, decreasing fitness by almost-equal-to 70%. An apparent change in plant quality following the initial bout of herbivory, however, deters high levels of subsequent herbivory, restricting tissue removal to the tips of the plant.
   When plants were found in close association with either pine or grasses (to add in the potential negative effects of competition), browsed plants still outperformed control plants, producing significantly more flowers and fruits than uneaten control plants. As in a previous study, these results support the contention that mammalian herbivores can benefit plants, enhancing plant fitness.

AB The effects of rainfall amount, rainfall distribution, and grazing intensity on net primary production and herbivory were examined for a dry tropical savanna. Above-ground net primary production in permanently protected savanna ranged from 329 to 741 g.m-2.yr-1 and was positively related to annual rainfall. It was not related to early rainy season rainfall, but was related to rainfall of the later part of the rainy season. Grazing stimulated 4-45% greater net primary production, the stimulation being higher at lightly and moderately grazed sites. Consumption, as estimated by comparing net primary production inside temporarily fenced and outside the fenced plots, was 476-734 g-m-2.yr-1. Consumption in the present savanna was positively related to net primary production, and to annual rainfall. Green biomass, being a function of soil moisture, was greater in the high rainfall year. Belowground net primary production in permanently protected savanna (BnpP) ranged from 404 to 838 g.m-2.yr-1 and was significantly related to annual rainfall. BnpP was not related to early rainy season rainfall but was related to late rainy season rainfall. Total net primary production ranged from 836 to 1579 g.m-2.yr-1 and was also related to annual rainfall, and was more sensitive to late rainy season rainfall than early rainy season rainfall. Grazing reduced belowground net primary production by 25-65% in grazed savanna (BnpG). Maximum reduction occurred in heavily grazed savanna. BnpG was inversely related with rainfall. Total net primary production (herbaceous + woody vegetation) of the savanna ranged from 11.9 to 19.1 Mg.ha-1.yr-1. The total net primary production of the savanna was similar to that of the native dry deciduous forest; however, the production of herbaceous species was 61% lower in the forest. The total net primary production of savanna was higher than that of the dry tropical forest when the belowground net primary production of the 0-50 cm layer was considered.

AB We tested the hypothesis that ants, attracted to the foliar nectaries of bracken fem (Pteridium aquilinum), confer protection to the plant in South Africa. Using ant-exclusion experiments with unmanipulated and artificially augmented ant densities, we were unable to detect a positive effect of ants on bracken, as neither the number of herbivores nor the level of herbivory was significantly greater on ant-free fronds. We then examined possible explanations for these results by performing a number of laboratory experiments using the ant Crematogaster peringueyi and two lepidopteran species, the major bracken-feeding herbivores. We showed that their eggs were susceptible to ant predation, but gained protection from their oviposition sites. We also demonstrated that bracken can benefit when densities of ants are high, such as when fronds are infested with honeydew-producing homopterans, as the lepidopteran larvae were more vulnerable to attack under these conditions. We propose that low ant density on the fronds is the primary factor limiting the occurrence of mutualism between bracken and ants in nature.

AB I develop a multivariate technique permitting the study of variation in the maximum velocity of animals. The method was applied to study maximum running speed (MRS) of adult golden marmots (Marmota caudata aurea). Subjects were encouraged to run to home burrows after being livetrapped, and were timed while running over a randomly selected distance between 1.7 and 36.0 m. Body mass, sex, distance run, substrate, and incline the individual ran across for 52 different subjects were entered into a linear model, which implicitly modeled MRS as a function of the running time. Body mass did not significantly explain variation in running time and was deleted. A new model fitted to the remaining variables significantly explained variability in time, and therefore MRS. The model did not violate any of the assumptions of linear models, and appeared to be robust. Intrayear repeatability of individual MRS was small, suggesting that environmental factors may account for much of the variation in MRS in golden marmots. The model predicts that the four significant variables (sex, distance run, substrate, incline) should influence space use and patch selection in golden marmots since they influence the speed at which an alarmed marmot can reach a refuge. The general method developed here can be applied to other species and should shed light on patch use and foraging behavior of refuging species.

AB To determine whether autumnal nutrient resorption contributes significantly to plant fitness, resorption was prevented by defoliating scrub oak (Quercus ilicifolia) plants ("defoliated plants") just prior to the onset of foliar senescence in the years 1985 through 1987. At the same time, to account for the potential influence of the reduced photosynthetic season on defoliated plants, another group ("shaded plants") was subjected to darkness, resulting in senescence in the absence of concomitant photosynthesis. In 1988, senescence and abscission were allowed to proceed normally in all study plants. In the three years that followed treatment years, 1986-1988, radial stem growth and yearly increases in foliar biomass of defoliated plants averaged 41 and 54% less than in controls. Acorn production in defoliated plants in 1989 was only 10% of that in either controls or shaded plants. In contrast to such marked responses in growth and reproduction, content of nitrogen, phosphorus, copper, manganese, and zinc in presenescent (green) leaves exhibited little response to defoliation in the previous year. In 1988, when resorption efficiencies could be measured in plants previously subjected to defoliation, there were no significant differences between control and defoliated plants for nitrogen, copper, manganese, or zinc. The efficiency of phosphorus resorption was 10% lower in defoliated plants. In shaded plants, resorption efficiencies of nitrogen, phosphorus, and copper, but not of manganese and zinc, were substantially reduced relative to controls in treatment years, indicating both quantitative and qualitative differences between dark-induced and normal senescence. The significant negative effects on growth and reproduction that resulted from preventing resorption in Q. ilicifolia offer strong support for the hypothesis that resorption contributes significantly to plant fitness.

AB Human-caused biological invasions by an alien species are a worldwide phenomenon.  They are particularly significant on isolated oceanic islands and represent a serious threat to endemic biota.  The Argentine ant (Iridomyrmex humilis) has become established in portions of the high-elevation shrubland of Haleakala National Park, Maui, Hawaii, over the past 25 yr.  This ecosystem lacks native ants but possesses many locally endemic and rare arthropod species.  Pitfall trapping and under-rock surveys were conducted to determine the effects of I. humilis on the local arthropod fauna.
   More than 180 taxa were sampled, mostly Arthropoda.  Presence of the Argentine ant is associated with reduced populations of many native and non-native arthropod species, including important predator species and major pollinators of native plants.  Effects of ant invasion were particularly severe at higher elevations of Haleakala volcano where endemic species normally exist at low densities.  Some taxa, primarily alien species, were more abundant in the presence of ants.
   Invasion of the Argentine ant has locally reduced the abundance of many endemic species in the shrubland ecosystem.  Although the spread of this ant species is slow, I. humilis appears to have the potential to invade a much larger area of Haleakala National Park than it now occupies.  Active management of Argentine ant populations will be necessary if the endemic fauna is to be preserved.

AB We compared published estimates of net fine root production (FRP) in forest sites to litterfall and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) to test whether annual rates of fine root and aboveground production vary together at global scales.  We also compared FRP estimates to theoretical upper limits as defined by our previously published relationship between total root allocation (TRA, carbon allocated to FRP plus live-root respiration) and litterfall.  Estimates of the carbon content of FRP in the total data set ranged from 25 to 820 g.m-2.yr-1 and were not correlated with annual litterfall or ANPP.  Different methods used for estimating fine root production, however, showed contrasting results.  Estimates derived using either sums of seasonal changes in fine root biomass ("Sequential Core" method) or differences between annual maximum and minimum fine root biomass ("Maximum - Minimum" method) were not correlated with either litterfall or ANPP.  Sequential Core estimates were often high relative to predicted TRA values, whereas Maximum - Minimum estimates were generally < 50% of TRA.  The small number of FRP estimates derived from root growth into root-free cores ("Ingrowth Core" method) were not correlated with measures of aboveground production but were all well below predicted TRA values.  In contrast to results of other methods, FRP estimates derived using ecosystem N budgets ("N Budget" method) were positively correlated with both litterfall and ANPP.  Comparing FRP estimates based on N budgets with previous results of forest soil C budgets suggested that annual fine root production increases with aboveground production and that almost-equal-to 1/3 of TRA is used for production of fine roots.

AB We re-examined the longstanding dogma that cavity-nesting birds have larger clutch sizes than open-nesting species because of lower nest predation rates, which allow longer developmental periods. We provide data on nesting success of open-nesting species plus excavator and nonexcavator species (cavity-nesters that do vs. do not create their own cavities) of birds that coexist in the same habitat and use natural nest sites; studies were conducted in central Arizona in high-elevation forest drainages from 1987 to 1989. In comparisons among species, nest success increased in the order open-nesting < nonexcavator << excavator species. Length of the nestling period increased, whereas number of broods decreased, with increased nest success across these nest types. Contrary to conventional expectation, clutch size did not increase directly with increased nest success and length of the nestling period, and these patterns were not simply a result of phylogenetic effects.
   A literature review of data on adult survival in land birds indicated that nonexcavators have significantly lower adult survival than the other two nest types. The lower adult survival of nonexcavators was associated with greater annual productivity than for the other two nest types. Annual productivity appeared to be associated with nest site attributes, whereas number of brood attempts was related to nest failure rate. Clutch size was a byproduct of annual productivity and number of brood attempts. Thus, the long-standing paradigm relating clutch size directly to nesting failure and developmental period was not supported.

AB The goal of this study was to explore how leaf and canopy level differences interact in determining total canopy productivity. Maximum rates of carbon gain and transpiration were found to be higher in leaves of the deciduous oak Quercus lobata than in the co-occurring evergreen oak Quercus agrifolia. However, the efficiency of water and nitrogen use is greater in leaves of Q. agrifolia. A biochemically based model of annual leaf photosynthesis using environmental field data indicates that the evergreen habit in Q. agrifolia partially compensates for the lower photosynthetic capacity of leaves and increases the amount of photosynthate produced per unit water or nitrogen. Simulations indicate that with low N or water availability, the evergreen species can produce canopies with greater annual production than the deciduous species; the converse is true at higher levels of resource supply. Some of the patterns of distribution of these species in northern California may be explained by examining the relationships between resource availability and estimated annual production.

AB I analyzed some of the factors affecting female breeding success in an eastern population of Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus). Over three seasons, 37% of all nests produced at least one fledgling. Over 77% of nests that failed were destroyed by predators. Nests in all 3 yr were clumped in time, with 50% of the nests being started in just 16% of the season. Temporal proximity of other nests (number of other nests started within +/- 2 d) was positively associated with the number of chicks fledged. The probability of avoiding predation increased with number of temporal neighbors even with date of first egg and female age controlled in a multivariate analysis. Clutch size was associated only with settlement date and not number of temporal neighbors nor date of first egg. Breeding earlier by females resulted in higher total success for some measures in some seasons, but early nests failed sooner and more frequently. Returning females bred earlier than new females, and even though their first nests were more likely to fail, they typically renested within the peak of nesting or, if their first nest succeeded, sometimes started a second brood before the end of the season. New females to the study area started nests late, but tended to do so within the peak of nesting thereby improving their chances of success. These results highlight the importance of considering demography in studies of the ecological causes of synchronous breeding and the timing of avian breeding seasons.

AB Granivore-seed interactions involve a feedback between granivore seed selectivity and seed availability. We examined this feedback to determine how seed preferences by the western harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, related to seed availability and, in turn, affected the soil seed pool. Preferences were estimated from natural diets as well as from experiments that controlled seed size, relative availability, and distance from ant nests.
   Seed availability to ants varied with season and over 2 yr. Colony activity and seed intake rates were correlated with seed availability. Seed preference by ants was correlated with the seasonal availability of preferred species, but not with unpreferred seeds. From the soil seed pool, ants preferentially harvested small, sound seeds. They removed 9-26% of the potentially viable seed pool each year, and as much as 100% of available preferred species. Seed densities were lower 2-7 m from nests, where foraging activity was concentrated, than 7-12 m from nests. In controlled preference experiments, P. occidentalis was unselective near nests, but preferred large seeds with higher assimilable energy content in trials 10 m from nests. A relatively low foraging activity > 7 m, however, suggests that this distance-dependent preference is rarely manifested in natural conditions and does not measurably affect soil seed dynamics.
   Our results point to the importance of studying diet choice in a natural context; preferences measured under experimental conditions may not correspond to natural diets. Such discrepancies in food preference measurements will affect predictions about how consumers influence the population dynamics of resource organisms.

AB The genus Greya is closely related to the yucca moths, and Greya species interact with their host plants in many of the same ways as yucca moths. Females both pollinate and oviposit in the flowers of their host. Unlike yucca moths, however, pollinating Greya species share flowers with co-pollinators that do not oviposit on the host. We studied the interaction between Greya politella (Walsingham) (Lepidoptera: Prodoxidae) and Lithophragma parviflorum (Hook.) Torr. & Gray (Saxifragaceae) to evaluate the effect on seed output of a pollinating seed parasite against a background of co-pollinators.
   Flowers were visited and pollinated mostly by bombyliid flies, solitary bees, and G. politella. Bombyliid flies alone composed 68-88% of the 5522 visits recorded over 2 yr. Although both male and female G. politella visited the flowers and probed for nectar, pollination by this species occurred only as females oviposited through the corolla tube, thereby passively transferring to the stigma pollen adhering to the abdomen. Visitation to flowers by all pollinators averaged 0.3-1.9 visits/h during daylight hours. Consequently, most flowers were visited multiple times during the several days that stigmas were receptive, and 77% of the flowers tagged during the 4 yr had some developing seeds. Pollination did not depend upon visitation by G. politella. Flowers receiving G. politella eggs had the same probability of producing some seed and the same mean number of developing seeds as flowers visited only by other insects.
   Most flowers received the eggs of only one G. politella female, and the larvae ate 15-27% of the developing seeds. The final number of mature seeds remaining in attacked flowers did not differ from unattacked flowers except at one site in 1 yr, in which the values for attacked plants were marginally lower. Other sources of variation affecting seed output masked the effects of seed consumption by Greya.
   Overall, G. politella females have the potential to be mutualistic with L. parviflorum: they are effective pollinators, generally visit most plants and about half the flowers in the population, and impose a fairly small cost on seed output. Nonetheless, the abundant and effective co-pollinators, which do not eat the developing seeds, swamp Greya's mutualistic effects. Under the current conditions at Granite Point, the relationship between G. politella and L. parviflorum may be mostly commensalistic. The evolution of specialization to G. politella as an exclusive pollinator would seem to be possible only in L. parviflorum populations in which effective co-pollinators were either rare or unpredictable. That is, the potential for the evolution of specificity in this mutualism appears to depend upon the community context in which the interaction takes place rather than upon the simple outcome of the pairwise interaction between Greya and Lithophragma.

AB We examined ecophysiological responses of Sanderlings (Calidris alba) to their nonbreeding environments in New Jersey (USA), Texas (USA), Punta Chame (Panama), and Puerto Viejo (Peru). Daily energy expenditure (DEE; measured using doubly labeled water) was strongly influenced by the thermal environment, being higher at colder locations, and equivalent to 4.2 times the basal metabolic rate in New Jersey, 2.8 in Texas, 2.1 in Panama, and 2.7 in Peru (200, 135, 100, and 129 kJ/d; n = 10, 5, 10, and 16, respectively).
   Time budgets varied among locations, but in all cases feeding and roosting accounted for approximately 90% of daylight hours. Feeding times were 55% in New Jersey, 90% in Texas, 40% in Panama, and 45% in Peru, suggesting that Sanderlings required more time to satisfy their food requirements in Texas than in the other locations.
   Total body mass and body fat increased linearly with decreasing long-term mean January air temperature but, because of the synchronous increase in energy expenditure, predicted survival times during food deprivation increased only slightly.
   Individual Sanderlings experience different living conditions throughout their non-breeding distribution, with DEE and nutritional reserves being determined primarily by temperature. Time budgets vary accordingly to accommodate these demands.

AB Shelter use patterns of den-dwelling Caribbean spiny lobster, Panulirus argus, appear to be regulated by predation risk. The risk of predation may be modified by (1) social structure, which alters the effectiveness of communal defense, and (2) the scaling between lobster size and shelter size, which enhances the protective capacity of the den. These hypotheses were tested with field enclosure experiments using artificial lobster shelters, which examined the effects of predation risk (i.e., presence or absence of a major predator, the nurse shark Ginglyostoma cirratum), spiny lobster size, social condition (i.e., presence or absence of conspecifics), and shelter size upon den choice by juvenile and adult P. argus. To corroborate the findings of the enclosure experiments we also quantified seasonal, size-specific abundance patterns of P. argus in the field by deploying artificial lobster shelters (casitas) of different sizes in two habitats that differed primarily in the potential for gregarious interactions: an inner-bay, sand seagrass flat with high lobster densities, and an outer-bay, seagrass bed adjacent to coral reefs with sparsely distributed lobsters.
   The experimental and observational field results were strikingly similar-social condition and the scaling of lobster size to shelter size jointly regulated den choice patterns of adult and juvenile Panulirus argus, particularly under high predation risk. When conspecific density and predation risk were low, lobsters resided primarily in shelters whose dimensions were scaled to their own; when conspecific density was high and predation risk was low, lobsters resided predominantly in large shelters offering the highest potential for gregariousness; when conspecific density and predation risk were high, lobsters shifted to gregarious habitation in smaller, scaled shelters; and, when predation risk was high and conspecific density was low, lobsters occupied smaller shelters. The frequency of gregariousness in the field was much higher at the inner-bay site, where lobsters were dense, than at the outer-bay site, where lobsters were sparse, even accounting for the difference in lobster density between sites. This study indicates that the density of conspecifics in a given habitat can enhance gregariousness in spiny lobsters, which in turn influences the relative impact of lobster size, shelter size, and predation risk upon den choice. In defining the critical determinants of den choice for P. argus, we also provide an empirical and conceptual framework for identifying how variation in the availability of resources, such as conspecifics and appropriately scaled refuges, influence the distribution and abundance of social, shelter-dwelling species.

AB We asked whether invasions by a predator in a patchy environment altered only the death rate of the prey, or whether there were also nonlethal effects, i.e., alterations in three other vital rates: net emigration, reproduction, and individual growth rates. Field studies documented the patch use of the guppy Poecilia reticulata and the killifish Rivulus hartii in pools of a second-order forest stream in Trinidad, before and after invasion by the piscivorous fish Hoplias malabaricus. Experiments revealed that the predator altered the within-pool use of space by Poecilia and Rivulus, and caused significant emigration of the prey from pools in which it was present. Further, intimidation by the predator in an experimental stream suppressed total egg production in Rivulus by approximately 50%, and created spatial patchiness (more eggs laid in safer pools) and temporal patchiness (pulses of eggs) in egg production. The presence of the predator also induced shifts to shallow riffle areas and significantly reduced the growth rate of adult but not juvenile Rivulus.
   In contrast to the familiar paradigm that increased predation rates result in compensatory increases in per capita reproductive rates and/or growth rates as the population is thinned, we found that the threat of predation suppressed rates of reproduction and growth in predator-occupied patches.

AB Drift activity of stream invertebrates typically is greatest during the nighttime hours in running waters throughout the world.  Such diel periodicity may be an adaptive response that minimizes exposure to visually hunting, drift-feeding fishes.  I tested this risk-of-predation hypothesis by examining drift behavior of mayflies in a series of Andean mountain and piedmont streams that vary in the abundance of drift-feeding fishes.  Drift was primarily nocturnal in piedmont streams with natural populations of visually hunting predators.  In contrast, mayfly drift activity did not differ between day and night in mountain streams that historically lack drift-feeding fishes.  However, in naturally fishless Andean streams containing introduced rainbow trout, nocturnal peaks in drift were observed for the mayfly Baetis, suggesting a rapid evolutionary change in behavior in response to an exotic predator.  When drift periodicity was examined along a gradient of predation regimes, activity was found to be increasingly restricted to the nighttime hours as predation risk became more intense.  Diel periodicity was observed even when fish were experimentally excluded, suggesting that nocturnal activity has evolved as a fixed behavioral response to predation, and is not a direct ecological consequence of diurnal feeding by fishes.  These observations support the hypothesis that predation risk is important in determining the timing of prey drift behavior.

AB Many organisms reproduce by releasing gametes into the environment. However, very little is known about what proportion of released eggs become fertilized. We examined the influence of spawning group size, degree of aggregation, position within an aggregation, and water flow, on in situ fertilization in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus franciscanus. This study was conducted at a depth of 9 m on the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Males were simulated by syringes filled with sperm; females were simulated by sperm-permeable containers filled with eggs. Individuals were placed 0.5 or 2.0 m apart within a 2 x 2 or 4 x 4 (group size of 4 or 16 individuals) experimental array. The results indicate that group size, degree of aggregation, position within a spawning group, and water flow all affect fertilization success. Fertilization success ranged from 0 to 82%. Increases in group size and aggregation, decreases in flow velocity, and central and downstream positions within an aggregation all lead to increases in fertilization success. Thus, individual reproductive performance is dependent on, and highly sensitive to, population parameters and environmental conditions.

AB Midge larvae (Diptera, Chironomidae) that weave filamentous algae into retreats or tufts, are dominant primary consumers in a river food web. In a previous study, densities of tuft-weaving midges increased in the presence of large fish. In the absence of large fish, midges decreased as densities of predatory invertebrates built up, and higher standing crops of algae were maintained. To examine the mechanisms underlying these dynamics, we compared the vulnerability of tuft-weaving midges (naked or in algal tufts) to fish and predatory invertebrates, in field and laboratory experiments.
   When midges were exposed for 1 h in the river to fish, 15 out of 15 midges in tufts survived, while 15 of 15 naked midges were consumed. Tufts afforded only partial protection to midges exposed to invertebrate predators, however. After 1 h, enhancement of survivorship by tufts was moderately significant for midges exposed to aeshnids, and insignificant for midges exposed to lestids and naucorids. We suggest that the vulnerability of tuft-weaving midges to invertebrate predators, and their relative invulnerability to fish, sets the stage for trophic cascades observed in this system. Fish, by consuming small predators, release midges, which graze down algae. The strong effects of fish as fourth-level consumers would not be predicted from their diets, in which algivorous mayflies dominate (>60% of the insect biomass found in each of the two most common fish species). Nevertheless, fish in this food web act as fourth-level, rather than third-level, consumers because of the differential vulnerability of one guild of primary consumers, which, when released from predation, can suppress plants.

AB Most theoretical models of the evolution of conditional responses require some form of cost to balance the benefits of an intermittently deployed character. The inducible spines, keels, and helmets of marine and freshwater invertebrates have proven to be tractable subjects for testing this hypothesis. Membranipora membranacea, a marine bryozoan, produces large spines within 2 d of detecting chemical cues from a predatory mollusc. The spine response, which increases with the level of predator attack and varies with colony size, is associated with reduced growth of colonies in short-term laboratory experiments. Because of the plastic nature of allocation shifts in colonial invertebrates, lifetime fitness consequences for inducibly defended colonies in the field were measured in this study. In two successive years, spined colonies grew somewhat more slowly, but also reproduced sooner than less-spined colonies. Spined colonies also senesced sooner than unspined colonies in the one year measured. The differences in growth trajectories between spined and less-spined colonies detected in the field were small relative to those predicted from short-term laboratory experiments, emphasizing the importance of field studies to evaluate the costs of defense in nature.

AB To understand the factors that structure ectomycorrhizal-basidiomycete communities at a local scale, we measured the strength of the relations among the fungal communities, the tree communities, and the environment of a series of forest ecosystems in southern Quebec. We collected fruit bodies belonging to ectomycorrhizal-basidiomycete families and genera, sampled the woody vegetation, and described soils and landforms at 11 permanent sampling stations. We first calculated similarity matrices among stations, one for each descriptor (fungal species abundance, woody species abundance, and abiotic variables). We then explored the dependence among these matrices using Mantel and partial Mantel tests, path analysis, and comparisons of ordinations and classifications. Similarity among ectomycorrhizal fungus communities was strongly and significantly correlated with tree community similarity, even when controlling for the effect of environmental similarity. When the tests were made with a similarity matrix based on those tree species that are known to be hosts of ectomycorrhizal fungi, abiotic similarity explained a significant portion of the residual variation in the similarity among fungus communities. To explore this complex relationship further, we analyzed species associations. The preference of fungus associations for different sets of abiotic conditions showed that some factors affecting fungal species distribution were different from those affecting the distribution of their tree hosts. Direct and indirect gradient analyses showed that humus characteristics seemed to be important niche dimensions of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The continuum concept was useful to interpret the complex relations among symbiotic species. Trees were the main component of the realized niche of ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycetes, but the fungal symbionts of a particular tree species followed that tree species for only a part of the abiotic gradients over which the host tree was found. This type of distribution predicts that beta diversity of fungi would be generally higher than beta diversity of ectomycorrhizae-forming trees. It also means that the ratio of fungus species richness to woody species richness would be high for most community gradients. Our results and those of previous mycosynecological studies agree with these predictions. The results have implications for the conservation of biodiversity: site selection for conservation based on vegetation classification or mapping, or on distribution of tree species, may miss important fungal species.

AB Marine invertebrates growing epifaunally on red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) prop roots in the Indian River, Florida, USA, were studied in a small mangrove island (Jim Island) through which a number of channels had been cut. Roots hanging down into the water supported diverse epifaunal communities including sponges, oysters, barnacles, bryozoans, and ascidians. To determine what factors control species' population dynamics and contribute to the high degree of spatial heterogeneity characteristic of communities in this unique habitat, two hypotheses were tested: (1) Distributions of species on the roots are controlled by differential growth and mortality due to physical features; and (2) Recruitment, as influenced by larval supply, structures the community.
   Four channels of the island were chosen for comparison and experimentation. Distributions and abundances of epifauna in the channels were determined and physical parameters (i.e., temperature, pH, salinity, flow, turbidity) were measured over a 13-mo period. Adult and early juvenile organisms were transplanted among channels and growth and survival were monitored. Patterns of water flow in the island were studied, and plankton samples were taken to determine how larval supply varied among channels in different parts of the island. General patterns of recruitment were measured for 9 mo and patterns were compared to adult distributions.
   Epifaunal cover differed among the study channels, with dramatic differences in abundance and species diversity. Except for flow, physical factors did not differ significantly among channels. Flow rate, per se, was not responsible for disjunct distributions since neither adult nor juvenile survival (processes expected to be most affected by flow) differed among channels. Plankton samples and recruitment measurements revealed that the importance of larval supply depended on the life history of the individual species. Those producing short-lived lecithotrophic larvae showed patchy distributions that were strongly affected by the location of source populations and prevailing patterns of water flow. Species with long-lived planktotrophic larvae were more evenly distributed and post-settlement processes played a more important role in their population dynamics.
   On large temporal or spatial scales, the effects of physical factors on juvenile and adult organisms are probably quite important in controlling epifaunal distributions. However, in this study, the distributions of organisms on Rhizophora mangle root within Jim Island were best explained by differential larval input, with larval life history determining the strength of coupling between adult populations, larval supply, and patterns of recruitment.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of abundant native large herbivores on ecosystem function of a spatially and temporally heterogeneous temperate grassland. Net aboveground primary production (ANPP), large herbivore consumption (C), and dung deposition (D), an index of nutrient flow from herbivores to the soil, were measured in grassland and shrub-grassland habitat on winter, transitional, and summer range used by herds of elk (Cervus elaphus) and bison (Bison bison) in northern Yellowstone National Park. Temporary exclosures (5-7 per site) were moved every 4 wk during the snow-free season to determine ANPP and C Data were collected during 1988, a year of drought and unusually high elk and bison population levels, and 1989, a climatically near-average year, with dramatically fewer elk and bison.
   All three processes, ANPP, C, and D, varied widely among sites: ANPP range: 16-589 g/M2, C range: 0-306 g/m2, and D range: 0-68 g/M2. An average of 45% of ANPP was consumed by herbivores. Production and consumption, and consumption and dung deposition were positively correlated across all sites. In addition, sites were grazed when plants were growing.
   There was a 19% reduction in ANPP from 1988 to 1989, likely caused by death or injury to plants during the 1988 drought. Drought also appeared to be partially responsible for reductions in elk and bison from 1988 to 1989, which were coincident with declines in C and D. Results indicate direct effects and suggest indirect effects of a single-season drought on grassland function that will persist for several years after the event.

AB In a 4-yr field experiment, we tested the hypotheses that insectivorous birds (1) controlled densities of herbivorous grasshoppers in an ungrazed semiarid grassland in southeastern Arizona, and (2) functioned as keystone predators, by limiting abundances of grasshoppers that otherwise might change vegetation cover and species composition, and/or by mediating the effects of otherwise competitively superior members of the grasshopper assemblage.
   We measured grasshopper densities and vegetation on 32 464-m2 grassland plots for 1 yr, then enclosed 16 of these plots with bird exclosures and continued data collection for 3 yr. Eight of the 16 experimental plots were further modified in the last 2 yr of the study by installing fine-mesh 1 m high barriers designed to retard grasshopper dispersal. Microclimates of caged plots differed only slightly from open plots. Lizards and rodents increased inside the exclosures, but they were removed and released elsewhere such that their average abundances did not differ among treatments.
   By the final year of the study, mean annual adult grasshopper density was > 2.2 times higher on plots from which birds were excluded, and where grasshoppers were enclosed by dispersal barriers, than on unmanipulated control plots. Mean nymph density was > 3.0 times higher in the same comparison. Grasshoppers were significantly more abundant in bird exclosures with insect dispersal barriers, indicating that experimental plots were dispersal sources rather than sinks. Seven of 12 common grasshopper species were more abundant inside the bird exclosures, while none was less abundant. Among the more abundant taxa, those responding most positively were grass feeders: Eritettix simplex, Opeia obscura, Paropomala wyomingensis, and Phoetaliotes nebrascensis.
   We found no evidence that grasshoppers competed with one another under increased densities inside the bird exclosures. Although the amount of insect herbivory was somewhat higher inside the bird exclosures, and was positively correlated with grasshopper density across all 32 plots (r = 0.87), overall vegetation cover and species composition did not differ among treatments by the end of the study. Dactylotum variegatum, an aposematic species apparently immune to avian predation, showed no significant responses to the experiment.
   Birds clearly limited grasshoppers in this grassland ecosystem, but they failed to qualify as keystone predators, at least in the short term, for two reasons: (1) in their absence, increased grasshopper densities had no appreciable impact on vegetation cover or species composition; and (2) there was no evidence that birds mediated competition among grass hoppers.

AB Small-scale natural disturbances involving the death of one to a few trees and creating gaps in the forest canopy are key processes in the population and community ecology of many forests.  I examined the patterns of replacement in gaps in a subalpine old-growth forest in southern coastal British Columbia to assess their role in the forest community.  I found no evidence that self replacement or reciprocal replacement act to maintain the current community composition.  Gapmaker-gapfiller comparisons indicated preferential replacement of all species by Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), suggesting that the community is undergoing successional change.  Nor did gap size, location within a gap, or local canopy composition appear to exert a strong influence on the species composition of regeneration within the gap.  The only circumstance where Pacific silver fir was not overwhelmingly dominant among gapfillers was on stumps, where almost all successful western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) gapfillers were located.  These patterns suggest that neither species-specific interactions between gapmakers and gapfillers nor variability in gap environments is adequate to maintain the current composition of the forest canopy.  However, caution is indicated in projecting a long-term trend from this short-term assessment of community trajectory.

AB Among gregarious, placental mammals, breeding synchrony usually occurs by adjustment of the timing of estrus, not births, and it has been suspected that the former process governs synchronized parturition. Gestation length data gathered on wild plains bison (Bison bison) over a 5-yr period demonstrate: (1) females in good body condition who were mated after the seasonal peak shortened gestation by almost-equal-to 6 d, synchronizing births with other females; (2) no similar adjustments occurred among females in poor condition; and (3) those females that shortened gestation incurred a cost because their neonates were, on average, almost-equal-to 20 kg lighter when 6 mo old. Reproductive synchrony may also be achieved by a less radical tactic; unmated females use olfactory cues to explore the status of other females prior to their own estrus but not after. These data suggest that there is adaptive variation in gestation length in bison cows in good condition and that assumptions about the constancy of gestation are unwarranted.

AB This study quantifies the influence of the persistent variation in maternal investment in individual offspring on larval fitness in a population of the oriental fire-bellied toad Bombina orientalis. Offspring fitness was evaluated by exposing newly hatched larvae to interspecific tadpole predators and assessing the effect of ovum size on the probability of surviving predation. The experiment incorporates natural variation in temperature that occurs during development. Embryos that developed in colder ponds took longer to hatch and hatched at a larger size. Larger size afforded larvae significant protection from predation. In addition, larvae that developed from large eggs in cold ponds had a higher probability of surviving predation than larvae that developed from small eggs. A significant interaction between egg size and developmental temperature, however, resulted in larvae that developed from large eggs in warm ponds having a lower probability of surviving predation. Larger eggs resulted in larger snout-to-vent lengths at all temperatures. In warm ponds, however, tails of larvae from large and small eggs were of equal length. Thus, diminished locomotory ability due to larger amounts of inert yolk can be invoked to explain the increased susceptibility to predation of larvae that developed from large eggs in warm ponds. In cold ponds tail length was substantially greater than in warm ponds, and larvae from large eggs tended to have longer tails than those that developed from small eggs. This allowed larvae from large eggs to achieve the advantages of increased body size.
   Thermally induced plasticity during early development resulted in an unpredictability regarding the adaptive value of a particular egg size. This result fits within a growing theoretical literature that indicates that environmental uncertainty can result in the natural selection of developmental plasticity in egg size, even though the fitness ramifications are realized in subsequent stages. Thus, increased maternal investment in offspring is not necessarily associated with an increase in offspring fitness, and the evolution of developmental plasticity in egg size may be the result of environmental uncertainty during the larval stages of life.

AB Northern Shrikes (Lanius excubitor) breed in a variety of habitats, including deserts. Deserts are characterized by unpredictable food supplies, which can lead to a slow growth rate of nestlings. However, given that Northern Shrike males use prey from their caches to augment freshly caught prey in providing food for their mates and nestlings, we hypothesized that their nestlings do not have a slow growth rate, but one that is equivalent to that in other passerine nestlings from temperate areas. To test this hypothesis, we measured growth rates and energy use in Northern Shrike nestlings and fledglings. We also measured energy expenditure in two adult males that were attending nests.
   Growth rate of Northern Shrike nestlings was similar to that predicted for passerines in temperate areas and therefore our hypothesis was supported. However, metabolizable energy available in the cache amounted to only almost-equal-to 7.2% of the total energy requirements of the nestlings or 4.2% of the total energy requirements of parents and nestlings during the nestling period. This suggested that other factors in addition to the cache were important in determining growth rate. These included (1) an extremely low maintenance energy requirement of the nestling; 30% of that predicted for a bird of its body mass when it weighed 10 g, which gradually increased to 70% at 50 g. This allowed for more of the energy intake to be used for growth and also reduced foraging costs of males; (2) the relatively low amount of body energy retained as a fraction of metabolizable energy intake, 0.15 to 0.16, indicating that more water per unit growth was incorporated than in other passerines.
   Energy expenditure of adult males was substantially lower than that predicted for a passerine of similar body mass. Males collected 4.83 times the energy that they consumed in order to provide their mates and offspring with food. Yet, their ratio of field metabolic rate to basal metabolic rate was only 2.33, the lowest reported value for adults feeding altricial young.

AB We report the results of a study designed to examine whether the spatial scale of experimentation in artificial ponds (cattle watering tanks) influences the results of manipulative studies of competitive and predatory interactions. The experiment consisted of two initial densities of Rana utricularia (Ranidae) tadpoles (0.035 and 0.14 animals/L) and the absence or presence (0.005 animals/L) of predatory Tramea lacerata (Odonata, Libellulidae) naiads in each of two water depths in cattle tanks of equal dimensions. Depth of tank did not significantly affect survival rate of tadpoles either as a main effect or as part of any interactive effect. At low tadpole densities the addition of predators decreased tadpole survival rates significantly, but at high tadpole densities they increased them significantly. Length of larval period increased significantly with increases in the density of surviving tadpoles at similar rates at both water depths, but deeper tanks produced significantly longer larval periods for the same tadpole density. Size at metamorphosis decreased significantly with increases in the density of surviving tadpoles, but it decreased at a significantly faster rate in the shallower tanks. The results indicate that experiments at smaller spatial scales do not necessarily distort the numerical dynamics in this system but that they can overestimate the importance of density variation in producing variation in some phenotypic characters.

AB Parallel hypotheses are advanced: (1) the distribution of resources in mesic upland temperate forests is patchy at a scale that is fine grained for adult trees and coarse grained for seedlings and (2) co-occurring tree species differ in abilities to exploit resources, resulting in differences in species rank order, by absolute growth rates of seedlings, among different resource combinations. Spatial variation in growth rate ranking among species may translate, through competition, into patterns of relative species abundances of seedlings that could persist in the community composition of adult trees. Here I report the results of factorial greenhouse experiments that address the second hypothesis. Seedlings of six co-occurring tree species of temperate eastern North American upland forests showed strong interspecific differences in growth rates and patterns of biomass allocation in response to variation in light and mineral nutrients. The ranks of four species in growth measures associated with competitive ability, absolute rates of change in stem height, total leaf area, and root biomass, varied significantly among nutrient treatments. Seedlings of American chestnut, Castanea dentata, ranked highest in traits associated with competitive ability over the broadest range of combinations of resource levels.

AB Large mammalian herbivores can influence the dynamics and structure of ecosystems by selectively removing tissues of specific plant species. The plant community composition can be altered as animals feed on some species but not others, changing the biomass, production, and nutrient cycling of an entire ecosystem. We used four paired moose (Alces alces) exclosures and browsed plots (built between 1948 and 1950) on Isle Royale, Michigan, to examine the influence of moose on aboveground biomass, production, and annual litterfall of boreal vegetation in 1987. Tree biomass was significantly greater (XBAR = 230 vs. 150 Mg/ha, df = 3, P < .05), shrub biomass was significantly less (XBAR = 1.9 vs. 3.1 Mg/ha, P < .05), and herb biomass was significantly less (XBAR = 0.2 vs. 0.8 Mg/ha, P < .05) in exclosures than in browsed plots. Tree production was greater in exclosures than in browsed plots (XBAR = 7.9 vs. 5.0 Mg-ha-1.yr-1, P = .05), but there was no difference in the production per unit biomass between exclosures and browsed plots. Shrub production in exclosures was similar to that of browsed plots (XBAR = 0.4 vs. 0.3 Mg.ha-1.yr-1, P > .05). Litter production was greater in exclosures than in browsed plots (XBAR = 3.5 vs. 2.3 Mg.ha-1.yr-1, P < .05), despite total vegetation biomass differences between paired plots. There was significantly greater herb litter produced in the browsed plots than in the exclosures (XBAR = 0.7 vs. 0.1 Mg.ha-1.yr-1, P < .05).
   Moose browsing prevented saplings of preferred species from growing into the tree canopy, resulting in a forest with fewer canopy trees and a well-developed understory of shrubs and herbs. In addition, browsing may have altered the eventual balance of white spruce (Picea glauca) was balsam fir (Abies balsamea), causing an increase in the former and a decrease in the latter. Thus, browsing by moose influences the long-term structure and dynamics of the boreal forest ecosystem, which has important implications for forest ecosystem management, especially where the population dynamics of moose are regulated.

AB To study the importance of silica as an anti-herbivore defense, two brome grasses were grown hydroponically to control silica, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium content and subsequently offered to the prairie vole, Microtus ochrogaster, in food choice experiments. Feeding experiments used two designs. In the first design, voles were presented a choice of a standard grass having intermediate silica content, and another grass with high or low silica and nitrogen content. In the second design, voles were presented with one of eight pairwise combinations of grasses. Voles consumed less grass of high silica content in both experiments, suggesting that silica acts as an effective deterrent to mammalian herbivores.

AB We studied leaf area production in two annual plant species, Abutilon theophrasti and Amaranthus retroflexus, under three day/night temperature regimes (18-degrees/14-degrees, 28-degrees/22-degrees, and 38-degrees/31-degrees-C) and two concentrations of carbon dioxide (400 and 700-mu-L/L).  The production of whole-plant leaf area during the first 30 d of growth was analyzed in terms of the leaf initiation rate, leaf expansion, individual leaf area, and, in Amaranthus, production of branch leaves.  Temperature and CO2 influenced leaf area production through effects on the rate of development, determined by the production of nodes on the main stem (the plastochron index), and through shifts in the relationship between whole-plant leaf area and the number of main stem nodes.  In Abutilon, leaf initiation rate was highest at 38-degrees, but area of individual leaves was greatest at 28-degrees.  Total leaf area was greatly reduced at 18-degrees due to slow leaf initiation rates.  Elevated CO2 concentration increased leaf initiation rate at 28-degrees, resulting in an increase in whole-plant leaf area.  In Amaranthus, leaf initiation rate increased with temperature, and was increased by elevated CO2 at 28-degrees.  Individual leaf area was greatest at 28-degrees, and was increased by elevated CO2 at 28-degrees but decreased at 38-degrees.  Branch leaf area displayed a similar response to CO2, but was greater at 38-degrees.  Overall, whole-plant leaf area was slightly increased at 38-degrees relative to 28-degrees, and elevated CO2 levels resulted in increased leaf area at 28-degrees but decreased leaf area at 38-degrees.  The effects on leaf area closely parallel rates of biomass accumulation in the same experiment, suggesting that responses of developmental processes to elevated CO2 and interacting factors may play an important role in mediating effects on plant growth.

ID CALIFORNIA; FIRE
AB Age structure of 12 stands of chaparral, unburned for 56-120 yr, was investigated. All shrubs produced discernible growth rings, and ring counts on stems from stands of known age, plus synchrony in annual growth ring width among species in the same stand, were taken as evidence that growth rings represented annual rings. Species that survive fire by vegetative regeneration from the root crown were capable, in the absence of fire, of continuously regenerating their canopy with basal sprouts. These multistemmed resprouting species had an uneven age structure, indicating continuous recruitment of new stems into the population. The predicted age distribution for resprouting shrub stem populations illustrated very different patterns for species within the same stand and for the same species in different stands. In most resprouting shrubs, < 15% of the stems dated back to the first decade after fire, and in many species the majority of stems were < 10 yr of age. This contrasts with obligate seeding shrubs that do not initiate new stems from the root crown, and for which, in undisturbed chaparral, 100% of the stems date back to the years immediately following the last fire.
   Seedling recruitment was abundant in seven of these old chaparral communities. Species with abundant seedling populations, ranging from 1000 to 37 500 individuals/ha, were Quercus dumosa, Q. wislizenii, Rhamnus crocea, Prunus ilicifolia, Heteromeles arbutifolia, and Cercocarpus betuloides. These species share the characteristic of regenerating after fire solely by resprouting, and seldom recruit seedlings during the first few decades after fire. Thus, it is concluded that these postfire obligate resprouters require long fire-free periods for successful reproduction and potential population expansion. For all but the last species, seedlings were most abundant in stands with a closed canopy and deep litter layer. Safe sites for establishment were not in gaps, although gaps may be important for successful recruitment of saplings into the adult population. For all sprouting species the actual age distribution of seedlings and saplings indicated that recruitment did not occur every year; mortality was high but most populations had some saplings that survived beyond the first decade. For all postfire seeding taxa, viz., Adenostoma, Arctostaphylos, and Ceanothus, no significant seeding recruitment was observed in these ancient communities. Seedlings of woodland tree species had colonized several of these old chaparral communities; however, even in stands a century old, successional replacement of chaparral was not imminent.

AB Because resource movement is restricted within and among branches of woody plants, different patterns of folivory are likely to differentially affect plant fitness. I examined experimentally the effects of folivory pattern on growth and seed output in the understory tropical wet forest shrub Piper arieianum (Piperaceae) in Costa Rica. I removed 10% of a plant's leaf area in two constrasting manners, either from a single reproductive branch or throughout the canopy. I also conducted the experiment at two times of year, 3 mo before flowering and during flowering, to determine the effects of damage relative to the phenology of reproduction. Leaf area was removed to simulate damage by natural folivores. I followed the effects of the removal for 1 yr, both for experimental plants and for control plants from which no leaf area was removed.
   Response to experimental folivory varied by treatment both at the branch and whole plant level. When 10% of a plant's leaf area was removed from single reproductive branches 3 mo before the main flowering season, those damaged branches grew less and produced 80% fewer viable seeds than did similar branches on control plants and plants that lost 10% of their leaf area, but with the losses scattered throughout the plant. These differences among treatments for individual branches translated into differences over the entire plant: plants with damage concentrated on one reproductive branch grew less overall and produced fewer seeds than plants of the other two treatments. Thus, restricted movement of resources in P. arieianum following leaf damage to single reproductive branches resulted in decreased whole plant fitness. When this same experiment was conducted at the time of flowering, there were no differences among treatments in seed production or growth, either at the branch or plant level. Results of these two experiments demonstrate that the effects of folivory are dependent on the timing of the loss relative to the reproductive phenology of the plant; resources necessary for fruit production are accumulated before flowering and not subsequent to it in P. arieianum. In 32% of plants in which damage was concentrated, seed production was reduced due to either abortion of the damaged branch (17%) or abortion of its bud inflorescences (15%). In the remaining 68% of branch-defoliated plants, neither level nor timing of flowering was affected by the experimental folivory, suggesting that reduction in seed production was due to a decrease in resource availability and not to a lack of pollinator visitation.
   Together these results add to the evidence that resource movement is restricted in woody plants, even in the face of a stress such as herbivory. The results further suggest that relatively small amounts of folivory can have major detrimental effects in woody plants and that damage pattern as well as damage level must be measured.

AB The roles of edaphic characteristics and grazing in regulating nitrogen cycling and belowground processes were simulated for the shortgrass and tallgrass regions of the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, by coupling a model of grassland productivity with a model of belowground decomposition processes. Grasslands of each region were simulated under ungrazed and observed grazing intensities to establish reference points for sensitivity analyses using a wide range of grazing intensities and different microbial biomasses. The consequences of patchy carbon and nitrogen deposition were also simulated. Results indicate that nitrogen cycling processes are affected differentially by grazing in the shortgrass and tallgrass regions. Net nitrogen mineralized by the microbial biomass in the shortgrass simulations declined from the ungrazed condition at low grazing intensities, and proceeded to increase from moderate to high grazing intensities. Plant nitrogen uptake was significantly correlated with net mineralization, and soil mineral nitrogen levels were greatest at moderate grazing intensities. In tallgrass simulations, soil mineral nitrogen increased with grazing intensity; net nitrogen immobilization occurred over much of the grazing intensity range because of low decomposition substrate quality. Tallgrass plant nitrogen uptake responded to urine nitrogen input to the soil and was uncorrelated with net mineralization. The potential for nitrogen competition between grasses and microbes was greater in the tallgrass than in the shortgrass because of lower total system nitrogen and lower grazing intensity in the tallgrass. The ecosystem-wide soil nitrogen gradient of the Serengeti governs most properties of nitrogen cycling, while within-region edaphic conditions and grazing create significant variation in local ecosystem processes.

AB Ecological and behavioral strategies that reduce predation were examined in North American porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) by testing two hypotheses: (1) habitat use varies with activity level and age class of animals, and (2) with increasing nutritional stress, individuals accept increased predation risk to avoid starvation. Observational and experimental data were gathered over a 2-yr period for a Great Basin Desert porcupine population during winter. Field experiments included manipulations of perceived risk using predator urines and simulated predator encounters with a dog (Canis familiaris). Compared to foraging animals, sleeping porcupines of all age classes avoided high risk (i.e., open) areas. Mass loss varied by habitat with individuals foraging in open areas (high risk) experiencing less mass loss than those foraging in groves (low risk). Age class also affected habitat use by foraging porcupines. Juveniles invariably remained in low-risk areas, even when more risky habitats contained potentially better quality forage. Two-year-old porcupines shifted to high-risk areas as body condition deteriorated, but condition exerted little influence on habitat use by adults, as this age class utilized habitat similarly throughout winter. These data reveal how a species with formidable antipredator morphology uses habitats in risk-sensitive ways.

AB Pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) typically exhibit a strong ontogenetic diet shift. Small (juvenile) pumpkinseeds feed primarily on soft-bodied littoral invertebrates and compete with small bluegill (L. macrochirus), while large (adult) pumpkinseeds feed extensively on snails. We compared pumpkinseed and snail populations in two Michigan lakes that contain bluegill (Three Lakes II and Three Lakes III) with populations inhabiting Wintergreen Lake, a lake lacking bluegill. In the absence of bluegill, pumpkinseeds were abundant and juveniles grew well; however, snail abundances were low and adult pumpkinseeds grew poorly. Furthermore, no ontogenetic diet shift to snails occurred in Wintergreen Lake, and the pharyngeal muscles and bones used to crush snails were smaller than in fish from Three Lakes II. Pumpkinseeds from Wintergreen Lake also required significantly more time to crush and handle thick-shelled snails, but not thin-shelled snails and nongastropod prey, than did fish from Three Lakes II. In a field caging experiment in Wintergreen Lake snail densities increased fourfold when pumpkinseeds were excluded.
   Historical data as well as the among-lake comparisons-suggest that the changes in Wintergreen Lake occurred in response to the selective elimination of the pumpkinseed's juvenile-stage competitor, the bluegill, via a winterkill event in the late 1970s. It appears that removal of bluegill released juvenile pumpkinseeds from competition and increased pumpkinseed recruitment into the adult stage, which resulted in the overexploitation of the adults' snail resource. These events then led to changes in adult pumpkinseed diet, growth, morphology, and feeding ability. These data are consistent with predictions from a two-stage life history model developed for the pumpkinseed-bluegill interaction and illustrate some of the important indirect consequences of interactions involving stage-structured populations.

AB In spite of widespread interest in the impact of herbivores on plants, few studies have addressed the lifetime consequences of attack for perennial plants. I have addressed this issue by studying the interaction between dwarf fireweed, Epilobium latifolium, and its principal herbivore in south-central Alaska, Mompha albapalpella (Momphidae, Lepidoptera). Fireweed is a long-lived, clonal herb that grows as clumps of connected shoots, and suffers from chronic attack by Mompha. I used a Markov Process (transition matrix) model, in combination with 3 yr of experimental data, to simulate expected changes in size and fecundity for clumps growing under different frequencies and intensities of damage. These analyses indicate that fireweed suffers fairly little reduction in growth from low intensity attacks, even if these attacks are quite frequent, but that high intensity attacks suppress growth even at very low frequencies. Damage greatly reduces seed production and also increases the inequality in seed output from different clumps. Because the patterns in which damage is meted out are crucial in determining herbivory's effects, knowing only average amounts of tissue loss will be insufficient to predict the impacts of herbivory. My results show that short-term impacts of herbivory cannot simply be extrapolated to longer time spans; a quantitative, modeling approach is necessary to understand herbivory's complicated effects.

AB The role of age-structured seed banks in influencing population dynamic parameters was investigated in a natural population of the winter annual Collinsia verna. Seed persistence was quantified by creating experimental seed banks in the field with seeds of known age. Survival and fecundities of adult plant stages were determined in quadrats of naturally occurring individuals in the field population. Bootstrapping was applied to the resulting data set to estimate means and 95% confidence intervals for population growth rate, stable age distributions, reproductive values, and elasticities. Analyses were performed to determine the extent of variation in these demographic parameters between two consecutive years and between three transects within each year. The results indicate that the presence of a seed bank, even of short duration, was critical to the demography of this population. The population was expanding rapidly in the 1st yr of the study (growth rate 1.80), but was declining during the 2nd yr (0.4 1). While the seed bank was demographically important in some transects during the good year (Year 1), the demographic effects of the seed bank were seen most significantly in the poor year (Year 2). The results of this study indicate the need for including age-structured seed banks in demographic analyses and the potential importance of seeds in age-structured seed banks in the shaping of plant life histories.

AB I investigated the interactions of intra- and interspecific competition with parasitism for populations of two terrestrial isopods, Porcellio scaber and Porcellio laevis, infected with a lethal virus.  In field experiments, I varied densities of one or both isopod species in enclosures in which food and virus presence were also manipulated.  I estimated the effects of intra- and interspecific competition, additional food, and virus infection on both the survival of P. scaber and the prevalence of the virus.  In uninfected populations, intraspecific and interspecific competition negatively affected isopod survival, although food resources had no effect.  In infected treatments, interspecific competition produced higher levels of virus prevalence than did intraspecific competition.  Virus infection and reduced food interacted to produce higher overall mortality in interspecific competition treatments than in intraspecific competition treatments.  The lack of significant effect of food on competition suggests that interference interactions rather than resource competition predominated.  This mechanism is supported by a laboratory study in which total food availability was controlled.  These results indicate that competition and parasitism interacted to produce the observed mortality patterns, and that ignoring mortality due to the virus would produce apparent interspecific competition.  The data suggest that the impact of P. laevis on P. scaber involves both direct and indirect effects.

AB The existence, causes, and consequences of dietary specialization were explored for a temperature reef fish, striped surfperch (Embiotoca lateralis). Analyses of diets of adults from Santa Cruz Island, California, revealed three dietary regimes within the same population: specialization on caprellid amphipods, specialization on gammarid amphipods, or a mixed (generalized) diet composed of both caprellids and gammarids. Individuals that had specialized on caprellids at the time of capture had obtained a greater intake of prey than did generalists or specialists on gammarids. Different diets were associated with marked differences in body size within most adult year classes; specialists on caprellids were the largest and specialists on gammarids were the smallest for a given age. Generalists were intermediate in size. Females in the different dietary categories were projected to experience different expected lifetime reproductive outputs. Fitness was calculated to be almost-equal-to 10% lower for generalists and almost-equal-to 20% lower for specialists on gammarids compared with caprellid specialists.
   The different diets did not arise from active choice of prey taxa, but from selective use of available foraging patches (i.e., types of benthic algae from which prey are harvested). The degree to which an individual fed from the red alga Gelidium robustum was an excellent indicator of the taxonomic composition of its diet. Gelidium was the only alga harboring substantial numbers of caprellid amphipods; more importantly, it was the most profitable foraging microhabitat. Access to Gelidium was unequal among striped surfperch due to strong interference, and only competitively dominant individuals appeared able to consistently harvest crustaceans from this microhabitat. The least aggressive individuals fed from other, less profitable patches that contained mostly gammarid amphipods. "Dietary" specialization was a passive consequence of patch selection dictated by a strong competitive hierarchy, and was not the result of active choice among available types of prey items.

AB Sex ratio, sexual dimorphism, and neighbor effects were investigated in 20 monospecific stands involving 3500 trees of Juniperus virginiana, a dioecious gymnosperm, near its northern limit in eastern Ontario.  We tested the hypothesis that the intensity of competition for a given tree will depend on the sex of its nearest neighbor because of differential costs of reproduction in male and female plants.  Population sex ratio was significantly male biased in only one stand but was male biased when data from all stands were combined.  Stand sex ratio was not related to age structure, stand density, or local competition intensity (based on separation distance/size regressions).  Male trees were significantly taller and had greater diameters in only three stands.  In the combined data from all stands, however, there was a greater representation of male trees among the larger diameter trees and among the taller trees.  Male trees were also significantly taller in the pooled data set.  These results suggest that female trees pay a slightly but significantly greater cost for reproduction in terms of reduced vegetative growth.  However, the effects of close neighbor proximity did not depend on a neighbor's sex, and male and female trees were randomly distributed relative to each other.  Hence, males and females appear to compete with similar intensities against each other and are not spatially segregated into separate "niches."  The overall greater height for males may be interpreted as a consequence of sexual selection, as greater height in male trees would confer greater success as a pollen donor, especially in dense monospecific stands characteristic of this species.

AB Although the possibility of complex dynamical behaviors-limit cycles, quasiperiodic oscillations, and aperiodic chaos-has been recognized theoretically, most ecologists are skeptical of their importance in nature. In this paper we develop a methodology for reconstructing endogenous (or deterministic) dynamics from ecological time series. Our method consists of fitting a response surface to the yearly population change as a function of lagged population densities. Using the version of the model that includes two lags, we fitted time-series data for 14 insect and 22 vertebrate populations. The 14 insect populations were classified as: unregulated (1 case), exponentially stable (three cases), damped oscillations (six cases), limit cycles (one case), quasiperiodic oscillations (two cases), and chaos (one case). The vertebrate examples exhibited a similar spectrum of dynamics, although there were no cases of chaos. We tested the results of the response-surface methodology by calculating autocorrelation functions for each time series. Autocorrelation patterns were in agreement with our findings of periodic behaviors (damped oscillations, limit cycles, and quasiperiodicity). On the basis of these results, we conclude that the complete spectrum of dynamical behaviors, ranging from exponential stability to chaos, is likely to be found among natural populations.

AB Fugitive species often live under harsh physical conditions, yet their ability to cope with environmental extremes has received little attention. We studied the association of fugitive plants and stressful physical conditions using salt marsh plants that live in hypersaline bare patches.
   In New England salt marshes, primary space is dominated by dense monospecific stands of perennial turfs, but disturbances frequently leave bare space that rapidly becomes hypersaline. Elevated salinities of bare patches result from direct exposure of soil to solar radiation and evaporative water loss.
   A number of fugitive plants that are rare in undisturbed salt marsh vegetation are commonly associated with bare patches before being displaced during secondary succession. Greenhouse studies show that plants that dominate undisturbed vegetation are stunted by high substrate salinities, whereas the photosynthesis and growth of patch-dependent fugitives are relatively independent of typical salinity variation. Moreover, in the field, watering more than doubled the survivorship and growth of seedlings in patches and more strongly affected dominants than patch-dependent fugitives.
   Our results show that physical conditions in salt marsh bare patches can limit plant colonization, and suggest that high salt tolerances may permit fugitive plants to utilize bare patches as refugia from competitors. Since fugitive plants are commonly restricted to physically stressful habitats, the ability to withstand harsh physical conditions is likely often an important aspect of their biology.

AB In population models, omnivorous predation (i.e., predation on > 1 trophic level) generally has a destabilizing influence, whereas habitat heterogeneity tends to stabilize both predatory and competitive interactions. I experimentally evaluated the impact of a native omnivorous predator and of habitat structural complexity on the structure of a freshwater littoral macroinvertebrate community. Perch (Perca fluviatilis) were stocked at three densities (no fish, and low and high natural densities) into pond enclosures with dense submerged vegetation present or absent. Macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass, size structure, and diversity as well as gut contents of perch were monitored over a 2-mo summer period.
   Perch consumed both predatory and nonpredatory invertebrates except molluscs. In vegetation, perch consumed macroinvertebrates almost exclusively during the whole experiment, whereas in the absence of vegetation, perch successively increased their consumption of microcrustaceans. The biomass of predatory invertebrates and the abundance of the dominant predatory invertebrate Sialis lutaria (Insecta: Megaloptera) decreased with increasing perch density in both vegetation treatments. In contrast, perch density had no effect on the biomass of nonmolluscan herbivores and detritivores. Vegetation increased the biomass of all macroinvertebrates and tended to delay the negative effect of perch on predatory invertebrates. Perch density had a negative effect on the mean size of total nonmolluscan macroinvertebrates, but not of predatory invertebrates and nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores considered separately. While perch density had an effect on the diversity (Shannon evenness and Shannon diversity) of only nonmolluscan macroinvertebrates (i.e., potential prey), vegetation had a positive effect on species richness (but not on evenness) of all macroinvertebrates.
   The results suggest that perch disproportionally preyed on predatory invertebrates, but that characteristics other than size per se were responsible for their higher vulnerability to perch. Perch may have affected nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores simultaneously through direct consumption and through indirect release from invertebrate predation, which could explain the lack of a perch effect on nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores. Complex interactions between the omnivorous predator, intermediate consumers, and resource species (macroinvertebrate herbivores and detritivores) may explain the relationship between perch density and macroinvertebrate diversity. The reduction in foraging efficiency of perch in submerged vegetation, and the observed diet shift of perch towards microcrustaceans when predatory invertebrates were still fairly abundant, suggest that relatively large predatory invertebrates were still fairly abundant, suggest that relatively large predatory invertebrates can coexist with fish in the littoral of lakes to a higher extent than in the pelagic zone. Predatory invertebrates may thus play a more important role in food web dynamics of littoral than of pelagic communities.

AB Effects of hydroperiod on the root production of bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) saplings were determined in large (8.0 m2 x 1.5 m deep) watertight enclosures over three growing seasons. Our objectives were to determine the effect of continuous and periodic flooding regimes on biomass production, carbon allocation to roots and shoots, and root-system morphology. The effect of the flooding treatments on plant biomass was different for 1-yr-old seedlings and 3-yr-old saplings. After one growing season, root and shoot biomass was highest in the periodically flooded (PF) treatment. After three growing seasons there were no significant differences in total biomass but there were differences in root-to-shoot ratios. Improved growth in the continuously flooded (CF) treatment began in the second growing season and coincided with morphological adaptations to flooding. Such adaptations include the production of water roots, development of intercellular air spaces, and distinctly different root-system morphologies.
   Periodically flooded cypress allocated more carbon to roots than did continuously flooded cypress and developed deeper root systems. A relatively deep rooting zone may have provided the PF saplings access to water and dissolved nutrients within the water table (50-60 cm deep during summer). Continuously flooded plants had low root-to-shoot ratios and shallow root systems. A relatively shallow rooting zone with ample water and nutrients allowed CF cypress to allocate relatively more biomass to leaves.
   After 3 yr, total productivity in the two treatments was not significantly different, yet belowground production was greater in periodically flooded saplings (P = .05) and there was a tendency for higher aboveground production in continuously flooded saplings (P = .14). Without the belowground production estimates we might have concluded that CF plants were more productive than PF plants. Most plants can respond to changing resource availabilities by shifting the allocation of carbohydrates to roots or shoots. Because resource availability in freshwater forested wetland ecosystems can be highly variable, studies of production should include estimates of root production.
