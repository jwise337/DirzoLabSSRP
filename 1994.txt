AB A new way of analyzing life histories is presented, based on the use of elasticities as derived from the limit properties of population projection matrices. In general there is not a simple relation between life history traits and matrix elements and their corresponding elasticity values. By recognizing the fact that a life history trait always is part of a life history pathway that can be contrasted to other pathways, this problem can be overcome. The various life history pathways form loops within the life cycle graph, the graphical representation of the projection matrix. It is shown that one can calculate the elasticities of such loops from the single elasticity values in the matrix in an unequivocal way. This presents a new and meaningful decomposition of total elasticity in population projection matrices and provides a potentially powerful tool to evaluate the importance of alternative life history options in demographic studies. This point is demonstrated using two previously published sets of data.

AB The proportion of animals in a population that breeds is an important determinant of population growth rate. Usual estimates of this quantity from field sampling data assume that the probability of appearing in the capture or count statistic is the same for animals that do and do not breed. A similar assumption is required by most existing methods used to test ecologically interesting hypotheses about reproductive costs using field sampling data. However, in many field sampling situations breeding and nonbreeding animals are likely to exhibit different probabilities of being seen or caught. In this paper, we propose the use of multistate capture-recapture models for these estimation and testing problems. This methodology permits a formal test of the hypothesis of equal capture/sighting probabilities for breeding and nonbreeding individuals. Two estimators of breeding proportion (and associated standard errors) are presented, one for the case of equal capture probabilities and one for the case of unequal capture probabilities. The multistate modeling framework also yields formal tests of hypotheses about reproductive costs to future reproduction or survival or both fitness components. The general methodology is illustrated using capture-recapture data on female meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus. Resulting estimates of the proportion of reproductively active females showed strong seasonal variation, as expected, with low breeding proportions in midwinter. We found no evidence of reproductive costs extracted in subsequent survival or reproduction. We believe that this methodological framework has wide application to problems in animal ecology concerning breeding proportions and phenotypic reproductive costs.

AB A prior survey of Michigan populations of a freshwater amphipod, Hyalella azteca, indicated that populations occur as one of two morphotypes that differ in body size and life history traits. Population types, which may represent separate species, are associated with distinct habitat types. Generally, lakes with centrarchid fish contain a small-bodied form, and fishless ponds and marshes contain a large-bodied form. In this comparative study of two Hyalella populations, I examine the potential role of size-biased feeding by major predators in maintaining, and perhaps generating, the pattern of association between Hyalella morphotype and habitat type. In Duck Lake (centrarchid fish present), overall mortality generally increased with body size in each of two study years, and adult mortality exceeded juvenile mortality. The opposite pattern was observed in a nearby fishless habitat, Duck Marsh, where mortality generally declined with size, so that juvenile mortality exceeded adult mortality. To determine the degree to which size-biased predation might cause the observed mortality patterns, I used stomach content analysis to assess prey size preferences of fish in the lake habitat and laboratory foraging trials to examine size-biased predation by invertebrate predators from the marsh. Fish predators displayed a strong tendency to prey on larger, adult Hyalella. Size preferences exhibited by larval dragonflies, the principal invertebrate predators in the marsh habitat, depended on predator body size, with small larvae preferring juvenile Hyalella and the largest larvae preferring adults. In general, size-selective predation by major predators in each habitat appeared to contribute importantly to overall mortality patterns, the exception being the marsh habitat in a year of low predator density.
   Observed differences in life history traits between populations are in close agreement with predictions derived from life history models addressing the influence of size-biased mortality on the evolution of reproductive allocation, size at maturity, and egg size. Life history characteristics of Hyalella were measured both on field-collected individuals and on individuals reared for approximately two generations in replicated predator-free artificial ponds. In field samples, the lake Hyalella population exhibited a smaller mean adult body size, smaller size at maturity, smaller egg size, and higher size-specific fecundity and reproductive investment than the marsh population. These life history differences were also observed in the artificial pond experiment, indicating that these traits are genetically based and nonplastic.

AB We studied the relationship between daily activity time and growth rate in hatchling sagebrush lizards (Sceloporus graciosus), a mainly montane species, and western fence lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis), which inhabit a broader range of thermal environments. The study involved two populations of each species along an altitudinal gradient in southern California and one population of S. occidentalis from Oregon. In the field daily activity time varied seasonally: activity periods were short during spring and fall and longer during the summer. Activity patterns also varied geographically: in montane and high-latitude environments, hatchlings experienced reduced opportunity for growth both daily and seasonally, because fewer, shorter days are available before the end of the activity season.
   We conducted laboratory experiments to measure the effect of the thermal environment on hatchling growth rates. Laboratory-incubated hatchlings had access to radiant energy for part of each day and were kept at 15-degrees-C (too low for activity) the rest of the day. The four experimental treatments (6, 9, 12 and 15 h of radiant energy per day) approximated the range of thermal environments encountered by hatchlings in the wild. Food and water were provided ad libitum. Mass-specific growth rates were plastic and generally increased with potential activity time in hatchlings from all populations. However, the form of this relationship varied among populations: growth rates of California S. occidentalis (''growth opportunists'') increased roughly linearly with potential activity time, whereas growth rates of Oregon S. occidentalis and California S. graciosus (''short-day specialists'') showed curvilinear responses to potential activity time. Interspecific and large-scale intraspecific differences in the form of the norm of reaction paralleled the differences in thermal environments encountered by hatchlings in nature. Populations of S. occidentalis at low elevation in California routinely experience short and long days of activity (e.g., 6-13 h/d) and the norm of reaction for growth rate increases linearly over this range. In contrast, populations of S. graciosus rarely experience days with > 9 h of activity and the norm of reaction for growth rate plateaus above 9 h/d. Similarly, nor-them populations of S. occidentalis from Oregon rarely experience days with > 9 h of activity and the norm of reaction for growth rate also plateaus above 9 h/d. On a large scale, therefore, growth responses appear to be appropriate to the thermal environments to which hatchlings are most commonly exposed. However, conspecific populations from different altitudes in California did not differ in growth response, although hatchlings experience different thermal environments in nature. We observed substantial among-family variation in growth rates of S. occidentalis, which may indicate genetic variation, a prerequisite for evolution by natural selection. Moreover, significant family x treatment interaction effects on growth rate that reflect underlying genotype x environment interactions indicate a genetic basis to the observed intraspecific and interspecific differentiation in the norm of reaction. Additional experiments demonstrated that (1) reducing food availability by 50% reduced growth rates by 50% in both species, and (2) growth rates did not differ between hatchlings whose eggs were incubated at 24-degrees vs. 27-degree-C.

AB Clutches of altricial birds generally hatch over a period of hours or days. Numerous hypotheses have been generated to explain hatching asynchrony, but most experiments have focused on the nestling stage to determine some post-hatch benefit such as increased reproductive success. We concentrated on proximate causes in the prelaying period, which have largely been ignored. In northern Saskatchewan, we censused prey species (small mammals) in early spring and measured the asynchrony of 273 clutches of the American Kestrel (Falco sparverius) over 4 yr. Hatching asynchrony was quantified in two ways: time for all the eggs within a clutch to hatch and mass hierarchies among nestlings. In good food years, the hatching spans of clutches were more synchronous than in poor years. Similarly, parents on good territories or females in good physical condition had more synchronous broods than parents under food stress. In an experiment, we supplemented food to kestrels during the prelaying period. Parents that were supplemented laid larger eggs and hatched those eggs more synchronously, but control pairs were more successful at raising young to the fledging stage. Synchronous hatching when food is abundant is consistent with the hypothesis of facultative manipulation of hatching spans in relation to nestling food supply, but not with the energy constraint hypothesis.

AB Relationships between peak annual vascular aboveground phytomass and annual climate variation in alpine plant communities located on Niwot Ridge, Colorado, were analyzed using path analysis. The live community types, fellfield, dry meadow, moist meadow, wet meadow, and snowbed, represent a snow depth-soil moisture gradient and broadly represent the most common vegetation types on east-facing slopes of the Front Range alpine zone. Using nine successive years of data, this is the first longer term analysis of alpine phytomass and climate and one of the longest nonagricultural production records available. Live phytomass ranged from 97 g/m(2) (snowbed) to 237 g/m(2) (fellfield). Among-community differences in phytomass were greater than differences among years, but there was also significant phytomass variation among years. Path analysis indicated that climate accounted for 15-40% of the variation in phytomass. The dry communities, fellfield (exposed rocky summit areas dominated by cushion and mat plants) and dry meadow, were most sensitive to previous year precipitation, the moist and wet meadow communities were most sensitive to current growing season soil moisture, and the snowbed community was most sensitive to date of snow release. Because of the relatively high amount of variation attributable to variables related to precipitation, changes in precipitation regimes that may occur in alpine ecosystems will likely result in changes in phytomass that are detectable with clip-harvest methods. Key words: alpine tundra; climate change; Colorado; ecosystems; path analysis; phytomass; plant community; soil moisture.

AB We tested five mechanisms of coexistence in a community of three common rodent species (two gerbils, Gerbillus allenbyi and G. pyramidum, and one jerboa, Jaculus jaculus) inhabiting sand dunes in the Negev Desert, Israel. The five mechanisms, based on foraging theory, considered various forms of habitat selection in time and space. From November 1986 until January 1988, we live-trapped to census rodent populations, counted rodent spoor in tracking plots to quantify activity, and measured the rodents' giving-up densities (GUDs: the amount of food remaining within a resource patch following exploitation by a forager) in seed trays to determine relative foraging efficiencies, The population sizes of the two gerbil species tended to fluctuate synchronously (unfortunately, we could not live-trap any jerboas). G. allenbyi biased its activity towards the stabilized sand habitat and towards the bush microhabitat. In contrast, G. pyramidum and J. jaculus biased their activity towards semistabilized sand habitats, and J. jaculus also biased its activity towards the open microhabitat. Despite divergent patterns of habitat use among species, G. allenbyi tended to be the most efficient forager and J. jaculus the least efficient forager regardless of microhabitat, sand habitat, or month, G. allenbyi's presence in the community may be assured by its higher foraging efficiency. J. jaculus's presence in the community may either result from its ability to travel greater distances and utilize rare, rich resource patches, or result from an herbivorous diet. G. pyramidum's presence with G. allenbyi in the community appears to require the less stabilized sand habitats and the ability of G. pyramidum to dominate rich patches by interference or nightly temporal partitioning.

AB Numerous small sedentary herbivores (mesograzers such as amphipods, small crabs, and gastropods) are resistant to seaweed secondary metabolites that deter larger, more mobile herbivorous fishes. In addition, specialist mesograzers experience reduced predation from fishes when living on seaweeds that produce these compounds. In this study we tested the hypothesis that generalist, as opposed to specialist, mesograzers can also benefit from reduced predation when they occupy chemically defended plants. Secondly, we assessed the hypothesis that low herbivore mobility, unconfounded by herbivore size or specialized feeding, selects for tolerance of seaweed chemical defenses, by comparing responses to the chemically defended brown seaweed Dictyota menstraulis of three sympatric, generalist amphipods that differ in mobility (Ampithoe longimana, Ampithoe valida, and Gamamruts mucronatus).
   Responses to Dictyota's chemical defenses varied as much among these three amphipods as among the phylogenetically distant fishes and mesograzers studied previously and supported the hypothesis that less mobile herbivores should be most tolerant of plant chemical defenses. In laboratory experiments, A. longimana moved little, preferentially consumed Dictyota over other seaweeds, and was unaffected by all Dictyota secondary metabolites tested. In contrast, G. mucronatus was active, it did not feed on Dictyota, and two of three Dictyota secondary metabolites deterred its grazing. Distribution of amphipods in the field suggested that these feeding patterns affected amphipod risk of predation. A. longimana reached its highest abundance on Dictyota, which is unpalatable to omnivorous fish predators, during the season when fish are most abundant. At the same time, the highly active C. mucronatus decreased to near extinction. Like G. mucronatus, A. valida was deterred by two Dictyota secondary metabolites, did not eat Dictyota, and disappeared when fishes were abundant.
   Experiments confirmed that A. longimana was less vulnerable to fish predation when occupying a chemically defended seaweed than when occupying a palatable seaweed. This decreased predation resulted primarily from a decreased frequency of encounter with predators when amphipods were on chemically defended plants. When we experimentally equalized encounter rates between omnivorous pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides) and the seaweeds Dictyota menstrualis and Ulva curvata (unpalatable and palatable, respectively, to pinfish) in the laboratory, amphipods occupying these two plants were eaten at similar rates. In contrast, when live amphipods were affixed to Ulva and Dictyota and deployed in the held, amphipods survived only on Dictyota. Heavy fish grazing on Ulva in the latter experiment suggests that poor survival of amphipods on Ulva may have resulted from greater detection and/or incidental ingestion of amphipods on this plant, due to frequent visitation by fishes. Infrequent visitation of Dictyota by foraging fish also may explain A. longimana's persistence through the summer on this chemically defended seaweed while the two Ulva-associated amphipods declined precipitously. These results (1) confirm that association with chemically defended plants can reduce predation on generalist, as well as specialist, herbivores and (2) suggest that preferential feeding on chemically defended plants is most likely for sedentary mesograzers because low mobility enhances the ability to exploit chemically defended seaweeds as refuges from fish predation.

AB We investigated how changes in food availability during development affected the timing of and body size at metamorphosis in two closely related species of tree frogs that use different larval habitats. We raised tadpoles of Hyla gratiosa (a temporary-pond breeder) and Hyla cinerea (a permanent-pond breeder) at two different temperatures on either constant resources or a regime in which we altered food levels at one of three different times during development. For both species, larval period was affected only by early changes in food level; early increases shortened larval period, and decreases lengthened it. The timing of metamorphosis of Hyla gratiosa showed greater plasticity than that of Hyla cinerea, because of its greater overall response to any food-level change and not because of any difference between species in the duration of the sensitive period. The two species showed comparable levels of plasticity in body size at metamorphosis; increases in food level produced larger body sizes, and decreases produced smaller sizes. However, in contrast to the pattern seen in larval period, later changes in food level had the greatest effect on body size. These results force a reexamination of current ideas about the adaptive significance of plasticity in the timing of metamorphosis in response to food availability in larval anurans. We offer a model of dynamic allocation that accommodates the extant data on this tissue.

AB In many coral reef fishes, males face the evolutionary problem of how to allocate sperm among frequent, daily matings in order to maximize the number of eggs they fertilize. A method is developed and tested for collecting and counting the number of sperm and eggs released during separate spawns of the coral reef fish Thalassoma bifasciatum. The method was used to examine the pattern of sperm allocation for pair- and group-spawning males. The number of sperm released by pair-spawning males varied positively with the number of eggs released by their female mates and with female body size. The data suggest that males economize on sperm release by providing the minimum amount of sperm needed to fertilize the egg clutch of the female partner. Fertilization efficiency (the number of eggs fertilized by a given number of sperm) was higher with large females than it was with small females. Males differed significantly among themselves in sperm output per spawn, with some males consistently releasing more sperm than other males with same-sized females. Male-male differences were not due to differences in male body size, quality of the spawning site, or the apparent degree of water movement. The number of sperm released per spawn did not decline throughout the daily spawning period, a pattern that disproved one but not all possible patterns of sperm depletion. Tn group spawns, the total number of sperm released and the number released per male were respectively 50 and 6 times the number released in pair spawns, on average. Both of these measures increased significantly with the clutch size of the spawning female. Overall, sperm production is probably sufficiently costly that males have been selected to allocate sperm carefully among their frequent daily spawns.

AB A recent model, designed with stream systems in mind, suggested that prey exchange (movement of prey among patches) tends to reduce predator impacts on prey density; that is, rapid prey im migration into a patch with predators can swamp local effects of predators on prey density. The previous model, however, included two assumptions that influence the model's qualitative predictions. First, it assumed that the system's focal patches are surrounded by an environment that has no predators and a constant prey density. More importantly, it assumed that prey do not alter their per capita emigration rates in response to the presence of predators. We extended the earlier model by relaxing these assumptions. Specifically, we: (1) addressed predator impacts in patches surrounded by background environments that do not have predators, (2) allowed the background environment to have a constant or decreasing prey density (i.e., we examined situations in which predators deplete prey), and (3) accounted for the fact that prey per capita emigration rates are often altered by the presence of predators.
   Our most interesting results concerned the profound effects of prey emigration behavior on the relationship between prey exchange and predator impact. If prey do not alter their emigration rates in response to predators, then, as predicted by the earlier model, high prey exchange should result in very low predator impact. If, however, prey disperse out of patches in response to the presence of predators (i.e., if prey per capita emigration rates are higher out of patches with predators than out of predator-free patches), then even very high prey exchange rates cannot swamp predator impact; instead, prey emigration adds to predator impact. Thus, depending on prey emigration behavior, increased overall prey exchange can either decrease or increase predator impact. Predators can also suppress prey emigration (e.g., if prey hide in refuges so effectively that they disperse at low rates from predator patches). In that case, high prey exchange rates tend to result in ''negative predator impacts'' (i.e., higher prey density in patches with predators).
   The details of the above relationships are influenced by whether or not the background environment has predators. If the background has predators, but predators do not deplete prey (e.g., if predation is offset by recruitment), then predator impact depends only on the ratio of per capita emigration rates out of predator and predator-free patches; that is, attack rates do not influence predator impact. In contrast, if predators can deplete prey, then attack rates influence predator impact. In that situation, if attack rates are high relative to prey emigration rates out of predator-free patches, then predator impact steadily increases over time.
   A literature review suggested that prey alterations in per capita emigration rates in response to the presence of predators can potentially explain some surprising natural phenomena, including the existence of ''negative predator impacts,'' and the apparent tendency for invertebrate predators (primarily, stoneflies) to have stronger impacts on prey than vertebrate predators (primarily, fish). Finally, we discussed possible adaptive links between prey escape success, refuge use, dispersal behavior, and predator impacts. This discussion raised a ''paradox of danger'': that due to their effects on prey exchange, more dangerous predators might often have unexpectedly weak effects on local prey density. In this context, we suggest a framework for studying relationships between prey behavior, prey exchange, and predator impacts.

AB Inducible C-4-like photosynthetic metabolism in Hydrilla verticillata leaf tissue elicits variability in photosynthetic phenotype, expressed as CO2 compensation point (Gamma). We conducted st field and laboratory study to investigate the ecological and adaptive significance of this physiological phenomenon. Spatial horizontal environmental heterogeneity was observed within clonal populations of H. verticillata in Florida, USA. Measured at midday, the edge habitat at the expanding periphery of the clone exhibited a dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration of 0.7 mmol/L, pH 7.1, a dissolved oxygen (DO) level of 0.13 mmol/L, and biomass of 0.2 kg/m(2). The mat habitat, located 200 cm towards the interior of the surface mat, exhibited DIC 0.1 mmol/L, pH 10.2, DO 0.48 mmol/L, and biomass 0.8 kg/m(2). DIC depletion and DO supersaturation characterized the mat habitat for most of the day and much of the growing season. Furthermore, net photosynthesis, daily carbon gain, and relative growth rate (RGR) of H. verticillata were reduced 80% by mat conditions compared to edge conditions. rs of H. verticillata were positively correlated with CO2 and bicarbonate concentration, and negatively correlated with pH, DO, and biomass. Low and high Gamma photosynthetic phenotypes were associated with the mat and edge habitats, respectively. Photosynthetic phenotype of H. verticillata appears to acclimate to environmental heterogeneity within a clone in the field.
   Net photosynthesis and dairy carbon gain of low Gamma phenotype H. verticillata was 128% and 40% greater than the high Gamma phenotype when measured in the mat habitat, but was 21% lower than the high Gamma photosynthetic phenotype when measured in the edge habitat under low quantum flux. Laboratory experiments showed a negative curvilinear relationship between the Gamma of H. verticillata and plant density. The data demonstrate that plasticity in photosynthetic phenotype of H. verticillata is a density-dependent, physiological response that optimizes carbon gain within a stressful heterogeneous environment. Evolution of facultative C-4-like photosynthetic metabolism in H. verticillata may have been an adaptation to the contraints imposed upon carbon gain by DIC and quantum flux limitation in the mat habitat.

AB Recent in situ fertilization studies of free spawning and brooding marine organisms have focused almost exclusively on the yield of fertilized ova (female reproductive success). As a consequence, we know little about the factors that determine male reproductive success. If marine organisms compete for fertilizations (as do many terrestrial organisms), then a male's reproductive success should be reduced by the presence of other males. We tested this hypothesis via in situ experiments employing allozyme markers for both a colonial ascidian (Botryllus schlosseri) and a bryozoan (Celleporella hyalina). Under moderate density conditions, the presence of closer male-functioning colonies reduced the fertilization success of more distant males in both species. In C. hyalina, male fertilization success also increased with allocation to sperm production. In addition, selfing rates in this species were negatively correlated with the abundance of outcross sperm. These results suggest that male reproductive success in sessile marine invertebrates must be assessed as a function of the gamete output and spatial distribution of other males in a population, and that the performance of isolated males may yield overestimates of male fertilization success in natural populations.

AB We compared growth and biomass allocation patterns of Lonicera japonica, an invasive vine in the southeastern United States, and its native congener, L. sempervirens, among three herbivory treatments. Growth and biomass variables were calculated at nine harvest dates across 14 mo under no herbivory, insect herbivory, and mammal and insect herbivory. In the absence of herbivory, L. sempervirens accumulated greater biomass and had higher growth rates than L. japonica. Lonicera sempervirens, however, experienced more herbivore damage than L. japonica, particularly due to the combined effects of insect and mammal herbivory. Total biomass accumulation and greater allocation to leaves and stems indicate a compensatory response to herbivory by L. japonica. These attributes in response to herbivory coupled with lower herbivory in its new range compared to L. sempervirens could give L. japonica a substantial advantage over its native congener.

AB Numerous behavioral hypotheses have been suggested to explain population cycles in microtine rodents. Charnov and Finerty (1980) proposed that preferential behavior toward relatives drives population cycles through kin selection. Their hypothesis makes three assumptions: (1) individuals behaviorally discriminate kin from non-kin, (2) kin associate, and (3) kin benefit from this association. These assumptions were tested in female prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) in eastern Kansas. An equal number of laboratory-born females and males were released into 12 fenced enclosures; 6 enclosures contained groups of littermate sisters and 6 contained groups of unrelated females. Space use, reproductive success, and survival were monitored during two replications of the experiment (Fall 1989 and Spring 1990). Female survival and reproductive success were not affected by relatedness, although more young were born in the Spring than in the Fall. Home range size and overlap were greater for females in related groups than those in unrelated groups. Home range size also was larger in the Fall than in the Spring. Prairie vole sisters associated spatially, but our measurements showed no fitness benefits conferred by these associations. Although the kin-selection hypothesis could not be demonstrated in this experimental population, relatedness in local neighborhoods may have consequences for small mammal population ecology.

AB To determine why herbaceous productivity in tropical and subtropical savannas is often significantly higher under crowns of isolated trees than in adjacent grasslands, experimental plots were established in three concentric zones, crown, tree-root, and grassland, surrounding isolated trees of Acacia tortilis in low-rainfall and high-rainfall savannas in Tsavo National Park, Kenya. Plots were fertilized (to determine the importance of nutrient enrichment by trees), shaded (to determine the importance of crown shade), fertilized and shaded (to identify fertilizer x shade interactions), or trenched (tree roots entering plots were severed to determine the importance of belowground competition between overstory trees and understory herbaceous plants). In addition, vertical root distributions of trees and herbaceous species were determined, and root systems of A. tortilis saplings were excavated.
   At both sites fertilization significantly increased herbaceous productivity in tree-root and grassland zones, but not in canopy zones; artificial shade had no effect on productivity at the low-rainfall site but increased productivity in the tree-root zone at the high-rainfall site; and severing tree roots had no effect on herbaceous productivity at the low-rainfall site, but increased productivity in the crown and tree-root zones at the high-rainfall site. Roots of herbaceous and woody species co-occurred within the same soil horizons, but tree roots extended farther into grasslands at the low-rainfall site than at the high-rainfall site.
   These studies suggest that savanna trees competed more intensely with understory plants at wetter sites, where their roots terminated in or near crown zones, than at drier sites, where their roots extended farther into open grassland. Nutrients added by trees to crown zones in the form of tree litter and animal droppings increased understory productivity by fertilizing nutrient-limited soils. Shade contributed more to regrowth after severe defoliation than to growth under more normal conditions.

AB Vultures comprise two geographically isolated and taxonomically distinct groups, Old World accipitrids and New World vulturids, and provide a classic case of convergent evolution. In both regions, several species of vultures often feed together in large numbers on carcasses. Behavioral studies of East African and Amazonian vultures have documented parallels in apparent ecological separation within this guild of specialized scavengers. Here morphological differences in skull, beak, and mandibular dimensions are compared among sympatric vultures in East Africa, South Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Amazonia, and the Pleistocene Rancho La Brea deposits in California. A discriminant function analysis based on morphological indices separates three basic feeding types: rippers, gulpers, and scrappers. Vultures of the three feeding types are present in both Pleistocene and Recent assemblages and show a similar distribution of body sizes into three size classes, suggesting that competition has favored similar pathways of ecological separation. This is true even when phylogenetic differences among some of the assemblages are partially accounted for. Comparisons between the fossil and extant New World vultures indicate that more specialized species were prone to extinction and that there has been a reduction in body size since the Pleistocene.

AB On coral reefs where herbivorous fishes are both numerous and diverse, many seaweeds combine mineral and chemical defenses. We hypothesized that combined defenses affect a greater number of herbivore species than either single defense, and in this study we experimentally tested this hypothesis. We first incorporated calcium carbonate (aragonite form) alone at a range of concentrations into an artificial diet composed of freeze-dried samples of the noncalcified, green alga Enteramorpha clathrata, carrageenan, cornstarch, and water. In field experiments where diets were made available to a natural fish community, aragonite had variable effects: in some trials aragonite deterred feeding, in others it had no significant effect, and in one trial it even stimulated feeding. Parrotfishes (Scaridae) and the surgeonfish Ctenochaetus striatus (Acanthuridae) showed a significant preference for food containing aragonite in field observations, while the surgeonfish Naso vlamingii and three damselfishes (Pomacentridae) were observed to feed preferentially on food without added aragonite. In the laboratory, the surgeonfishes Acanthurus nigrofuscus, A. triostegus, A. xanthopterus, and Nasa unicornis and the rabbitfish Siganus spinus (Siganidae) significantly avoided food with added aragonite. However, the parrotfishes Scarus sordidus and S. schlegeli consumed significantly more food containing aragonite than plain food. Ctenochaetus striatus avoided aragonite only at the highest aragonite concentration and showed no preference at lower aragonite concentrations.
   Artificial diets containing natural concentrations of aragonite (80% dry mass), diterpenoid secondary metabolites from Halimeda macroloba (1% dry mass), and a combination of both defenses (80% aragonite and 1% aragonite-free dry mass of diterpenes) were tested in the laboratory against four fish species. Scarus sordidus and Ctenochaetus striatus avoided secondary metabolites but not aragonite, and Naso lituratus and Siganus spinus were deterred by aragonite but not by secondary metabolites. All fishes were deterred by one defense or the other, and all fishes but Scarus sordidus avoided food containing the combined defenses. Combinations of aragonite and secondary metabolites increased the number of fsh species that were effectively deterred from grazing relative to either single defense.

AB Caste theory states that worker size distributions in ant colonies have evolved for efficient division of labor and predicts that they should vary with habitat and have an effect on fitness. We tested these predictions in a comparative study of worker size variation and colony fitness in Florida and Long Island populations of Trachymyrmex septentrionalis. Colonies from the two populations were excavated shortly before the time of the mating flights, so that workers and reproductive forms could be censused. We measured worker head widths in each colony and analyzed the resulting size frequency distributions using the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis, and also principal components derived from these parameters. Size frequency distributions were unimodal and close to normal, with a tendency to negative skewness. Colonies in the Long Island population had both larger workers and greater size variation than those in Florida. Florida colonies followed a growth trajectory in which the mean and standard deviation of worker head width both increased with colony size, whereas in Long Island there was an inverse relationship between the mean and standard deviation that was independent of colony size. Analysis based on the principal components showed that worker size variation significantly affected fitness in both populations, and this was not a secondary effect of colony size. Population differences in colony life history strategies may account for the observed patterns: the Long Island population appears to be adapted for surviving the winter diapause, while the Florida population has experienced different selective pressures, possibly for rapid colony growth. Size variation that has evolved in the context of life history strategies may serve as a preadaptation for division of labor.

AB It has been demonstrated in several taxa that generalists grow better when they ingest a mixed diet than when they are restricted to just one or two items, but there are few cases that provide definitive evidence for how this benefit is achieved. Two hypotheses are addressed concerning the possible benefits of feeding on a variety of foods: (1) mixing foods increases the quality of the overall diet by improving the nutrient balance and (2) mixing improves the diet due to dilution of any one plant secondary compound. The generalist grasshopper Schistocerca americana was used in a series of experiments to distinguish between the two hypotheses.
   Experiments using artificial foods with complementary nutrients demonstrated that dietary mixing improves growth while the amount ingested is decreased. Nutritionally identical foods with differing plant secondary compounds led to different growth rates, but insects able to mix generally grew at intermediate rates. Experiments with domestic or wild plant mixtures gave results generally closer to the pattern found with complementary nutrients than the pattern found with differing poisons, but both hypotheses are supported to some extent.

AB Proleptic flowering is common among plant species from tropical seasonal forests. In these species flower initiation and anthesis are separated by a prolonged rest period (the unfavorable season), and the two processes are controlled separately. Proleptic species are appropriate for assessing the within- and between-season effects of herbivory on flowering and reproductive success. We investigated the reproductive consequences of artificial defoliation of the proleptic shrub Erythroxylum havanense, in a seasonal dry forest in western Mexico.
   Twenty individuals in each of three sites were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: control (no manipulation), and three levels of leaf area removed: 0, 25, and 100%. Plants in the latter three treatments were sprayed with insecticide to prevent additional foliage consumption by natural herbivores.
   Within a season undamaged plants (control and 0% defoliation) produced from two to four times more seeds than damaged ones (25 and 100% defoliation). In addition, completely defoliated plants exhibited a significant increase in both fruit maturation time (8 d) and average seed mass (9.5%), when compared to the plants in the other treatments. There was no evidence of a trade-off between seed number and seed mass, or between ripening time and seed mass.
   One year after defoliation, vegetative growth (basal area increment) was reduced only by 100% defoliation. Likewise, flower and fruit production were significantly reduced only in this treatment. Although defoliation reduced seed production in both years, only the first year's reduction was a direct consequence of defoliation. Seed production decline in year 2 was an indirect effect of the reduction in flower number, suggesting that fruit and seed maturation do not depend on resources stored, but on annual production of photosynthates.
   Plant survival was not affected up to 5 yr after defoliation.
   Since most of the effects were evident only in the 100% defoliated plants, our results reflect those instances when insect outbreaks occur and E. havanense plants are completely defoliated.

AB The ability of soil to sustain its supply of nutrients to a growing forest is controlled by a complex of biogeochemical processes. Forest soil data are notably absent, however, that describe sustained nutrient supply or nutrient depletion. The objective of this study was to evaluate how exchangeable nutrient cations of a previously cultivated Ultisol responded to the first three decades of pine forest development. On six occasions during the three decades, the upper 0.6 m of soil was sampled from eight permanent plots and chemically analyzed with the same procedures. During this period, KCl-exchangeable acidity (as positive charges of adsorbed H and Al ions) increased by 37.3 kmol(c)/ha in the upper 0.6 m of soil and positive charges of exchangeable Ca and Mg were depleted by 34.8 and 8.9 kmol(c)/ha (by 696 and 108 kg/ha), whereas, exchangeable K was reduced by only 0.5 kmol(c)/ha (19 kg/ha). Depletion of soil exchangeable Ca was on the same order of magnitude as Ca removals (i.e., Ca accumulation in biomass and forest floor plus that lost in soil leaching). Removals of soil Mg also appeared to outpace resupply from recycling, atmospheric deposition, and mineral weathering, but not to the same degree as Ca. Over the three decades, soil leaching loss of these divalent cations (from 0.6 m depth) appeared equal to cation accumulation in biomass plus forest floor, with sulfate balancing about half these cations in leachates. In contrast to Ca and Mg, total K removals from the soil exceeded reductions in soil exchangeable K by nearly 20-fold. Exchangeable K was well buffered in surface mineral soils apparently due to a combination of biological recycling via leaching of canopies and forest floor plus mineral weathering release. These nutrient dynamics may be common to many nutrient-demanding forest ecosystems supported by soils with low activity kandic or oxic horizons. Such soils (Ultisols and Oxisols) occur on many hundreds of millions of hectares in temperate and tropical zones.

AB We examined interactions between the ant Iridomyrmex nitidiceps and the lycaenid butterfly Paralucia aurifera in southeastern Australia, and present data supporting the hypothesis that both participants benefit from their association. In the field, lycaenids persisted only on those host plants that ants subsequently colonized. In the laboratory, lycaenid larvae reared with ants were 31-76% heavier, developed 37% faster, and commonly completed one or two fewer instars than larvae reared without ants. Ant tending also resulted in 20% heavier pupae, 69% shorter pupal duration, and 5% larger adults as measured by forewing length; adults were not significantly different as measured by body length. We hypothesize that these positive effects occurred largely because ant-tended lycaenid larvae spent more time feeding than did untended larvae. Field data documented that ants colonized host plants only after lycaenid larvae were present, indicating that ants actively maintained the association. In laboratory experiments, 40% more ant workers survived when lycaenid larvae were present than when they were absent, although ant mass was not significantly affected. We hypothesize that the survivorship effects occurred because ants consumed the lycaenid's nectary gland secretions, which contained considerable amounts of glucose and amino acids. Our results show that lycaenids can benefit from ants in ways other than, or in addition to, protection from natural enemies and that they incur minimal developmental costs from associating with ants.

AB Some species of coastal sage and chaparral shrubs of California are extremely tolerant of tissue dehydration, surviving water potentials as low as -9 MPa during dry summer months. Such low water potentials (high tensions on xylem water) are known to cause severe embolism formation in the xylem vessels of woody plants, blocking water transport and potentially causing shoot dieback. Thus drought hardy species of coastal sage and chaparral are either extremely resistant to water stress-induced embolism or they become severely embolized during summer drought. We compared the seasonal changes in xylem water potential and xylem embolism (percent loss in hydraulic conductivity of stem segments due to air emboli) between co-occurring Salvia mellifera (coastal sage) and Ceanothus megacarpus (chaparral) growing in the Santa Monica Mountains of southern California. We also determined the relative sensitivity of each species to water stress-induced embolism by artificially dehydrating branches and measuring percent loss in hydraulic conductivity of xylem tissues at a given water potential. We found that both species experienced the same minimum in seasonal water potentials (-8 MPa) but the xylem of S. mellifera lost 78% in hydraulic conductivity whereas the xylem of C. megacarpus lost only 17% in hydraulic conductivity. These values for a natural plant community were within 10% of those predicted by our artificial dehydration curves. Our estimate of susceptibility to water stress-induced embolism indicated that 50% loss in hydraulic conductivity would occur at -4.5 MPa for S. mellifera but at -11 MPa for C. megacarpus. Irrigation of S. mellifera for one summer reduced loss in conductivity from 78 to 38% and increased leaf areas 10-fold, indicating that xylem embolism and leaf drop were drought induced. Our results show that xylem tissues of S. mellifera are more sensitive to water stress and tissue dehydration than those of co-occurring C. megacarpus. The observed ability of S. mellifera to inhabit drier sites than C. megacarpus may result from drought deciduousness in summer and high growth rates in spring that facilitate rapid construction of new xylem and leaf tissues. It may be that facultative drought deciduousness in coastal sage is tightly coupled to drought-induced embolism of xylem tissues.

AB We investigated adaptation of the armored scale insect Pseudaulacaspis pentagona (Targioni-Tozzetti) to individual mulberry trees (Morus alba L.) in Maryland, USA. We tested local adaptation by transferring eggs within and between trees and by measuring the subsequent survival of developing scales. Survival of P. pentagona was significantly higher when raised on their natal host tree compared to rearings on novel trees. This finding is consistent with local adaptation of scale populations to individual host trees. However, we found evidence for differences in local adaptation of scale populations only between populations on distantly separated mulberry trees. There was no evidence for genetic differentiation of scale populations on neighboring trees, suggesting that gene flow inhibited local adaptation.
   By adapting to individual plants, few populations of herbivores appear to sacrifice their ability to colonize new conspecific hosts. While local adaptation may fine tune herbivore populations to individual host phenotypes, it is unlikely to play a general role in explaining the patchy distribution of herbivorous insects on their host plants.

AB The nature of the interaction between plants and their soil community was investigated by testing for differential responses of four old-field perennial plant species to inocula derived from soil communities that had been grown with (''cultured by'') one of these four plant species. The differentiation of the soil communities was evident in measurements of plant survival, phenology, growth, and root-shoot ratios. Effects on survival and growth suggest negative feedbacks between these species and the soil communities that they culture. Survival rates of Krigia dandelion were significantly reduced when grown with their ''own'' soil community. Considered as a whole, the three other species (all grasses) had significantly lower growth and root-shoot ratios when grown with soil communities started with their own inocula compared to soil communities started with the inocula of other species. However, the significance of this effect on growth rate and root-shoot ratios was due primarily to the pairwise comparison of Anthoxanthum odoratum and Danthonia spicata and of Anthoxanthum and Panicum sphaerocarpon, respectively. Pairwise comparisons of Danthonia and Panicum do not suggest differential responses to each other's soils in growth rate or root-shoot ratios nor do soil communities appear to affect the relative competitive ability of these two species. While the components of the soil community responsible for these effects have not been identified, similar although less pronounced patterns were observed in experiments using inocula consisting of washed live root segments as compared to experiments using whole soil as inoculum, suggesting that root pathogens are one important agent.

AB Populations of the scorpion Cercophonius squama and the terrestrial amphipod, Family Tallitridae, were monitored by pitfall trapping in southeastern Australia for 8 yr as part of a field experiment to study the effects of habitat fragmentation and remnant habitat patch size an biological diversity, for 3 yr prior to the fragmentation treatment, and 5 yr thereafter.
   The abundance of scorpions did not change significantly with habitat fragmentation and there was no discernible effect of remnant size. The abundance of amphipods in the remnants relative to that in the controls decreased markedly after fragmentation, more so on smaller remnants than on larger ones. By reason of their ecological and biological characteristics, scorpions seem resistant to the changed ecological conditions brought about by habitat fragmentation, at least in the short term, whereas amphipods are more susceptible.
   It is not yet possible to generalize about the responses of species to habitat fragmentation. Management of fragmented ecosystems to maintain biological diversity should be directed at populations of species because different species respond differently.

AB In farmland areas of western Finland more than four-fifths of breeding birds are migratory species, mostly small passerines. Migrants arrive at their breeding areas later than their main avian predators, European Kestrels (Falco tinnunculus). We provide evidence that avian predators are a major factor modifying the breeding bird assemblage of a large field. The distribution of kestrels (hence, predation) was manipulated using nest boxes, which are the only nesting places in open farmland. We counted birds on nine 25-ha plots in which a kestrel pair bred, and on nine control areas situated >1000 m from the nearest kestrel nest in large agricultural fields during early summer 1992. We also counted birds on 15 transect lines (length 1000 m, width 100 m) radiating away from kestrel nests. Observations of the hunting behavior of breeding kestrels showed that kestrels mostly captured their prey items <1000 m from their nest. Breeding bird density was higher on control areas than on areas close to a kestrel nest. In particular, densities of migratory and small birds (body mass <140 g), which are potential prey of kestrels, were lowest near the predator nests. In contrast, the densities of nonmigratory and large-sized birds (body mass >140 g) were independent of the presence of kestrel nests. Skylarks (Alauda arvensis), the most abundant migratory species in the study area, bred less often near kestrel nests than farther away. The results of line transect counts corroborated results of area counts. Our conclusion is that predation risk influences habitat selection of small migratory species in open habitats where scarce vegetative cover gives little protection.

AB Optimization theory of leaf nitrogen distribution in canopies with respect to photosynthetic carbon gain predicts that vertical leaf nitrogen gradients are steeper in dense canopies than in more open canopies. We tested this prediction at the intraspecific and the interspecific level by studying the effects of two levels of nitrogen supply on canopy structure and vertical leaf nitrogen distribution in experimental populations of three Carer species that dominate in low-productivity fens (Carer diandra and Carer rostrata) and in high-productivity fens (Carer acutiformis), respectively. The high-productivity species had a significantly higher amount of leaf area per unit ground area, a higher absolute amount of nitrogen in the canopy, proportionally more leaf area in upper canopy regions, and steeper gradients of leaf nitrogen in the canopy than the low-productivity species. Similarly, increased nitrogen supply resulted for each species in a higher amount of leaf area pet unit ground area and a higher absolute amount of nitrogen in the canopy. However, only in C. acutiformis did an enhanced N supply lead to proportionally more leaf area in upper canopy regions and to steeper gradients of leaf nitrogen in the canopy. It is suggested that the observed patterns in Carer acutiformis (a very high canopy with a large amount of leaf area) are not only directed towards maximization of photosynthetic carbon gain, but are also directed towards suppression of other species in the competition for light.
   The interspecific differences in canopy structure and leaf nitrogen distribution are in agreement with the optimization theory. However, at the phenotypic level the low-productivity species did not show proportionally more leaf area in upper canopy regions and steeper gradients of leaf nitrogen in the canopy upon enhanced N supply, despite a strong increase in the total amount of leaf area. This suggests that low-productivity species have a lower phenotypic plasticity with regards to their vertical leaf distribution pattern and their vertical leaf nitrogen distribution than high-productivity species.

AB Population foraging in a patchy environment can lead to an ideal free distribution of competitors among the patches. If patch profitabilities do not change too quickly, individuals may remember patches in which they had been successful and use their memory when they have to deal with new competitors. I investigated whether three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) expect to find food in a patch in which they had foraged between 1 and 14 d ago. Long-term memory for a patch in which the fish had formerly been fed existed for at least 8 d. In another experiment I tested whether sticklebacks use their long-term memory in population foraging. A group of four sticklebacks, each of which had been fed singly in one of two patches, was offered food in both patches simultaneously 3 d later. The four fish achieved an ideal free distribution, with those that had fed in the left patch preferring the left patch and those that had fed in the right patch preferring the right patch, although all fish sampled both patches frequently. The preference for the former patch in the ideal free distribution was similar when there had been a pause of 6 d between feeding and test. Implications of long-term memory for competitive foraging are discussed.

AB The effect of food web structure on community stability and resilience has rarely been examined using empirical data. Yet there is a practical application for such studies insofar as resistance stability determines the ability of a system to ''absorb'' anthropogenic stress and adjustment stability determines the reversibility of resulting damage. The stability of zooplankton food webs in 46 Precambrian Shield lakes was examined using data collected in the 1970s, when pH ranged from 3.8 to 7.0, and in 1990, when pH had increased by up to two units in some lakes. Acidification overcame resistance stability at pH < 5.0, as evidenced by decreases in species richness, numbers of predatory and competitive links, directed connectance, predator generalization, and linkage density, identified by analysis of variance. Adjustment stability was demonstrated by changes in food web attributes in lakes with higher pH in 1990 than in the 1970s. Species richness, numbers of predatory and competitive links, linkage density, and predator generalization all increased relative to the 1970s values. Food web attributes of ''recovering'' lakes were statistically indistinguishable from those of lakes of similar pH that had not been more acidic in the 1970s. Similar trajectories of food web change were followed during environmental degradation and recovery. Planktonic food webs of anthropogenically acidified lakes may eventually recover to resemble their pre-acidification condition, given sufficient time without acidic inputs. Whether adjustment stability is a general feature of anthropogenically stressed systems remains to be determined.

AB To test if secretory canals limit the host ranges of polyphagous moth larvae, we measured the growth of Trichoplusia ni (cabbage looper) and Spodoptera ornithogalli (yellow-striped armyworm) on plants in nine families, including species with and without secretory canals. Larvae were reared to the final instar on excised leaves of the test plant, weighed, then enclosed in the field on either detached leaves with depressurized canals or intact leaves with undamaged canals. After 24 h, the larvae were reweighed and the leaves were examined for evidence of trenching. For comparison, nine additional species of generalist caterpillars were tested on Lactuca serriola (with latex canals) using the same procedure; five of these species were also tested with Petroselinum crispum, which has resin canals.

AB Diel vertical migration (DVM) of zooplankton is a behavioral antipredator defense that is shaped by the trade-off between higher predation risk in surface waters and reduced growth in deeper waters. We conducted two laboratory experiments to quantify the costs connected with DVM. In the first experiment, Daphnia magna were kept individually in thermally stratified flow-through tubes and exposed to seven different concentrations of fish-exuded kairomones. Above a threshold concentration, the strength of migration increased with increases in the concentration of fish exudates. Enhancement of migration resulted in a lower mean ambient temperature experienced by the animals and marked decreases in individual growth and reproduction rates.
   In order to separate costs due to low hypolimnetic temperatures in a stratified system from costs due to reduced food concentrations in deeper waters, we conducted an experiment with a 2 x 2 factorial design (fish presence vs. absence and high vs. low food conditions). Differences in mean ambient temperature between Daphnia that performed DVM and nonmigrating animals were found to have a much stronger impact on life history parameters than food effects. A reevaluation of field data on DVM in Daphnia further supports the view that vertical temperature gradients are more important than food gradients.

AB Larvae of the midge Metriocnemus knabi and of the mosquito Wyeomyia smithii are found only inside the water-filled leaves of the carnivorous pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea, where they feed on decaying invertebrate carcasses. I examined the interaction between the two species in a natural population in western Newfoundland, Canada.
   Experimental manipulations of rates of prey capture by pitcher-plant leaves indicated that both insect species are limited by carcass supply. However, the interaction between them is commensal rather than competitive. Midge growth was unaffected by experimental quadrupling of mosquito density in otherwise unmanipulated leaves. Mosquito growth, on the other hand, increased with midge density in both natural leaves and artificial leaf microcosms.
   This interaction is an example of a processing chain commensalism. Although both species feed on carcass material, they use it in different stages of decay: midges feed by chewing on solid material, while mosquitoes filter-feed on particles derived from the decaying matter. Consumption of particles by mosquitoes does not affect resource availability for midges, but feeding by midges does influence particle availability. In artificial leaf microcosms, high bacterial densities occurred sooner in artificial leaves with midges present than in identical leaves without them. Bacteria are a direct food source for mosquitoes, and high bacterial densities also indicate that other organic material is being comminuted, providing particles for mosquitoes and surface area for bacterial growth. Although midges remove some of the carcass resource that also limits mosquitoes, their net effect on mosquitoes is positive because they accelerate conversion of the remaining resource to particles.

AB I monitored natural nests of an Illinois population of the western painted turtle (Chrysemys picta bellii), a species with temperature-dependent sex determination, for 4 yr to investigate the relationships between vegetational cover at the nest site and hatchling sex ratio.
   Most nests produced hatchlings all of one sex (66% of 116 nests). Hatchling sex ratio within nests was predictably related to the nesting beach and to the quantity of solar exposure at the nest mainly from the south. The North beach tended to produce more all-male nests and an overall male-biased sex ratio than did the South beach. Within each beach, nests with more vegetational cover on the southern and perhaps western aspects produced more males than did more exposed nests. However, the relationship between solar exposure and nest sex ratio was absent during two atypically cool summers.
   This study suggests a possible mechanism by which female turtles choose the thermal environment of nests and, hence, the sex ratio of their offspring: they may assess vegetational cover on the nest site at oviposition.

AB Recruitment, the addition of new individuals into a community, is an important factor that can substantially affect community composition and dynamics. We present a method for calibrating spatial models of plant recruitment that does not require identifying the specific parent of each recruit. This method calibrates seedling recruitment functions by comparing tree seedling distributions with adult distributions via a maximum likelihood analysis. The models obtained from this method can then be used to predict the spatial distributions of seedlings from adult distributions.
   We calibrated recruitment functions for 10 tree species characteristic of transition oak-northern hardwood forests. Significant differences were found in recruit abundances and spatial distributions. Predicted seedling recruitment limitation for test stands varied substantially between species, with little recruitment limitation for some species and strong recruitment limitation for others. Recruitment was limited due to low overall recruit production or to restricted recruit dispersion. When these seedling recruitment parameters were incorporated into a spatial, individual-based model of forest dynamics, called SORTIE, alterations of recruitment parameters produced substantial changes in species abundance, providing additional support for the potential importance of seedling recruitment processes in community structure and dynamics.

AB An important challenge in ecology is determining the degree to which the dynamics at one level of organization can be predicted by the behavior of its component parts at a lower level of organization. This endeavor is likely to succeed only if the behavior of the component parts remains essentially the same regardless of the state of other elements in the system. For example, the behavior of multi-species communities is predictable from a knowledge of interactions among species pairs only if the functions describing the pairwise interactions are not modified by the abundance of other species in the community. Here I discuss some of the problems in identifying empirically whether such interaction modifications (''higher order interactions'') occur. Four persistent problems include (1) confusion about the definition of ''higher order interactions,'' (2) discrepancies between the currency typically used in theoretical work (instantaneous rates) and that required in empirical work (the states of variables [e.g., abundances] after a discrete time period), (3) frequent incongruities between statistical procedures and the underlying theory being tested, and (4) a failure to explicitly consider the theoretical framework being tested. Progress may be more rapid in the future if the theory being tested is specified, and if empirical investigations shift their focus toward identifying possible mechanisms by which interactions can be modified.

AB An epizootic of sarcoptic mange was prevalent among Scandinavian red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) during the late 1970s and 1980s. By substantially reducing the population density of foxes, the epizootic created a natural experiment on the importance of fox predation for prey density. The fox population started to recover during the late 1980s. We monitored the populations of the fox and its prey [voles (Cricetidae), mountain hare (Lepus timidus), European hare (L. europaeus), Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), Black Grouse (T. tetrix), Hazel Grouse (Bonasa bonasia), and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)] throughout the event, on a local (10(1)-10(2) km(2)), a regional (10(4) km(2)), and a national scale. Methods included den counts, snap-trapping, pellet/dropping counts, counts of displaying birds, young/adult ratio from incidental observations of deer, regional questionnaires, and national hunting records. The study revealed red fox predation as a crucial factor in limiting the numbers of hares and grouse as well as fawns per doe of roe deer in autumn, and in conveying the 3-4 yr cyclic fluctuation pattern of voles to small game. The classical view, that predators take but a ''doomed surplus'' of their prey, was false for these species in Scandinavia.

AB A battery of null models is used to test for the presence of six aspects of community structure in the pattern of plant species distributed in patches around focal or ''nurse'' plants at a site in the Bolson de Mapimi, Chihuahua Desert, Mexico. Significant community structure was found in five of the six types of test. There were significantly more positive associations between species than expected for a random assemblage. Examined pairwise, negative associations were almost all with one of the two main focal plants: Larrea tridentata or Opuntia rastrera. The other species were generally positively associated with each other, because of their rarity in small patches. Species-poor patches contained nonrandom subsets of the flora of species-richer patches (i.e., the species/patch matrix was significantly nested). This is interpreted as indicating the existence of species whose establishment is dependent on conditions that can be provided by other species. There was also checkerboarding in the species/patch matrix, indicating the possibility of some competitive exclusion.
   All species tended to occur more often on species-rich patches, but relative to other species Larrea occurred significantly more often on small patches. Therefore we suggest that the presence of this shrub may be required before other species, such as Opuntia rastrera, Jatropha dioica, and Opuntia schottii/grahamii, which tended to occur on two-species patches, may colonize a patch. Some species, most of them cacti, showed a significant tendency to occur in the largest patches, suggesting that they were able to invade a patch only after preconditions for dispersal or establishment had been satisfied by habitat changes induced by other species. The two main foci, Larrea and O. rastrera, differed in the overall species composition of their associated flora. Many species showed a significant tendency to occur in adjacent patches, indicating the importance of dispersal, probably by rodents, in determining distribution. We conjecture that these patterns result from colonization processes in which facilitation, inhibition, and tolerance all play a role.

AB Segregation of species occurs when a species tends to be found near conspecifics. This is frequently investigated using a contingency table, classifying each point by its species and the species of its nearest neighbor. Pielou proposed using a 1-df chi-square test of independence as a test of segregation. This test is inappropriate if all locations within a study area are mapped. For completely mapped data, I derive the expectations and variances of the cell counts in the nearest-neighbor contingency table under the null hypothesis that species labels are randomly assigned to points. The properties of the cell counts suggest a new 2-df chi-square test of spatial segregation, a pair of species-specific tests, and a pair of species-specific measures of segregation. In small samples, the proposed tests have the appropriate size, unlike the Pielou test. The new test is illustrated with three examples: Pielou's Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine data, a realization of a mother-daughter process, and the locations of male and female water tupelo trees.

AB Stable carbon isotope composition was determined on leaves of woody plants sampled along an 800-km transect on the western flank of the Rocky Mountains at altitudes ranging from 610 to 2650 m above mean sea level. Discrimination decreased by 1.20 +/- 0.11 parts per thousand (mean +/- 1 SE) per km of altitude (n = 15, F-1,F-13 = 127.8, P < 0.0001). The change in discrimination was just sufficient to maintain a constant CO2 partial pressure gradient from ambient air to the intercellular spaces within the leaf for both deciduous (P = 0.60) and evergreen (P = 0.90) species. However, the CO2 gradient so maintained was significantly steeper among evergreen (11.31 +/- 0.14 Pa) than among deciduous (9.64 +/- 0.14 Pa) species (t = 8.4, 27 df, P < 0.0001). As a consequence, the evergreens had lower discrimination than the deciduous species at any given altitude. After the data were corrected for altitude, further analysis revealed significant differences in discrimination and in CO2 partial pressure gradient among species. Thuja plicata (western red-cedar), a scale-leaved evergreen, had lowest mean discrimination (16.67 +/- 0.50 parts per thousand, n = 4) and the steepest CO2 gradient from ambient to intercellular spaces (14.5 +/- 0.5 Pa). Larix occidentalis (western larch), a deciduous conifer, had the highest discrimination (20.95 t 0.34 parts per thousand, n = 9) and the flattest CO2 gradient (8.3 +/- 0.4 Pa), A simple model of water-use efficiency predicted that evergreen species would average 18 +/- 2% higher in water-use efficiency at any given altitude and that mean water-use efficiency would triple across a 2000-m altitude gradient. The difference between evergreen and deciduous species is attributable to variation in the CO2 partial pressure gradient, but the tripling with altitude was almost exclusively a consequence of reduced evaporative demand.

AB Introduced brown trout (Salmo trutta) have replaced native common river galaxias (Galaxias vulgaris) as the principal predators in many streams in the Taieri River system, New Zealand. Brown trout and common river galaxias present prey with contrasting predation risks as galaxias forage mainly at night using mechanical cues and trout present a higher predation risk during the day by foraging using visual cues. To determine if this change has affected the behavior of a siphlonurid mayfly, Nesameletus ornatus, we compare the behavior of N. ornatus nymphs from three neighboring streams that have different fish predation regimes (trout, galaxias, fishless) when confronted with all possible predation regimes in the laboratory (trout, galaxias, no fish). N. ornatus from a trout stream were consistently nocturnally active whether trout, galaxias, or no fish were present. In contrast, when mayflies from streams without trout were confronted with trout, no consistent diel periodicities in their behavior were observed. However, when mayflies from streams without trout were tested with and without galaxias they altered their behavior according to the presence/absence of the native predator. The possibility that N. ornatus accumulates evolutionary experience of trout through adults flying between streams may be ruled out: mayflies with no possible experience of trout did not respond differently to those from streams without trout but with the possibility of migrating from trout streams close by. The presence of different predatory fsh may have resulted in differential trade-offs between foraging and predator avoidance. The probability of mayflies leaving food patches was higher during the day in the presence of trout. In contrast, the probability was higher during the night in the presence of galaxias. Trout and galaxias were also associated with differential reductions in the number of mayflies on the substrate surface and the proportion of mayflies on food patches, with consequent effects on time spent foraging. These responses indicate that both the history of the prey population and the nature of the predation risk have considerable influence on antipredator behavior and indicate a possible important influence on stream communities of predatory fish through sublethal effects on prey behavior.

AB Factors affecting yearly population levels of both breeding and nonbreeding numbers of Black-capped Chickadees (Parus atricapillus) were studied over a 10-yr period in a 35-40 ha partially residential area in western Massachusetts. More than 90% were color-banded each year. Breeding levels were remarkably stable, varying between 12 and 15 pairs. Most of the few recorded changes in breeding density were negatively correlated with changes in fall numbers over the previous two years, producing a see-saw effect. Significantly more fall recruits settled in years of higher subsequent winter survival, suggesting an ability by fall chickadees to assess survival in the coming winter. Winter survival was not affected by sex, but was strongly affected by within-sex rank. Among young birds, those with high winter rank gained significantly more local breeding territories than did lower ranked birds. Low-ranked yearlings vanished from the study area in all but one spring, most driven away by the territorial behavior of higher ranked birds. Significantly more yearlings vanished at flock break-up in years with higher overall winter survival. Older chickadees showed no similar spring drops in numbers. If 10-15% of those driven off in spring bred elsewhere, birds surviving until 1 September lived an average of approximate to 1.8 yr. Annual survival was approximate to 59%.

AB Xylem embolism was measured in nine tree species for one or more years. Species were ring-porous (Quercus sp.), diffuse-porous (Alnus, Betula, Populus spp.) or coniferous (Picea, Larix, Abies spp.). Intraspecific (Populus tremuloides) and intrageneric (Betula, Alnus) comparisons were made between sites in northern Utah and interior Alaska. Most embolism, >90% in some dicot species, occurred in winter. Within sites, dicot trees embolized more than conifers. Between sites, Alaskan dicot trees embolized less than their Utah counterparts. Differences were explained by vulnerability to embolism caused by freeze-thaw cycles. Most conifers were entirely resistant, whereas dicot trees were vulnerable. Less embolism in Alaskan dicot trees was associated with fewer freeze-thaw events in Alaska vs. Utah. Vulnerability was positively correlated with conduit volume and hydraulic conductance per unit xylem area (k(s)). Tracheids were superior to vessels in avoiding freeze-thaw-induced embolism, and had lower k(s). At the other extreme, ring-porous xylem had the highest k(s) but lost >90% of hydraulic conductance after a single freeze-thaw event. Vulnerability to water-stress-induced cavitation was not correlated with conduit volume or k(s). Dicot species either reversed winter embolism by refilling vessels with positive root pressures during spring (Betula, Alnus spp.), or tolerated it and relied on new xylem production to restore hydraulic conductance (Quercus sp.). Conifers reversed embolism by refilling tracheids in the absence of positive pressure. Populus species behaved inconsistently, showing some reversal one year but none the next. Even without embolism reversal, Populus species had hydraulic conductances per unit leaf area equal to other diffuse-porous species.

AB The understory flora of successional forest in the Delaware/Pennsylvania Piedmont zone (USA) is species poor relative to old regrowth stands in the region. Impoverishment may reflect (a) limitations on dispersal of potential colonists, or (b) the unsuitability of successional stands for establishment. To examine the importance of dispersal, herb and shrub distributions were surveyed in successional stands of varying age and spatial arrangement.
   In successional stands contiguous with species-rich old-regrowth forest, understory species richness declined with distance into the successional stands, implying contagion across the old-regrowth ecotone. Individual species showed evidence of contagion in 67% of site x species combinations. Mean rates of migration ranged from no measurable movement (e.g., Carex laxiflora, Cimicifuga racemosa) to >2 m/yr in some species (e.g., Galium aparine, Potentilla canadensis). Significant differences in rate of migration were observed among seed dispersal modes: ingested > adhesive >> wind greater than or equal to ants greater than or equal to none. By contrast, there were no significant differences in rate between clonal and exclusively sexual species.
   In stands disjunct from old regrowth, the understory was species poor relative to old-regrowth forest due to a lack of species dispersed by ants and spores and those with no obvious dispersal vector. Understory species richness was greater in older disjunct stands and in stands closer to potential sources of propagules than in young and isolated stands, trends that were also noted in distributions of individual species.
   These results suggest that accessibility to colonists plays an important role in determining understory composition of successional stands. Medium- and long-range migration appears to be an issue of seed and spore dispersal rather than vegetative propagation. The extremely low migration rates of some species threaten their continued existence in the second-growth forest landscape.

AB To explore how plants may influence dispersal of their own seeds by manipulating the behavior and physiology of their dispersers, we studied the effect of a soluble chemical (or chemicals) in the fruits of Witheringia solanacea (Solanaceae), a Costa Rican cloud forest shrub, on passage of its seeds through the guts of one of its major dispersers, the Black-faced Solitaire, Myadestes melanops (Muscicapidae: Turdinae). Using artificial fruits containing natural seeds, we found that the presence of a crude pulp extract reduced the median seed retention time by nearly 50%. Estimation of seed dispersal distance as a function of retention time suggested that more rapid seed passage results in shorter average dispersal distances, especially for seeds retained <20 min. At the same time, germination trials revealed that seeds voided rapidly were far more likely to germinate than those remaining longer in Myadestes guts. We propose that ''laxative'' chemical(s) in Witheringia fruits balance these positive and negative consequences of ingestion by Myadestes.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine experimentally the potential mechanism(s) favoring specialized foraging behavior of stream-dwelling predatory stonefly larvae (Megarcys signata), and whether this specialized behavior was fixed or flexible. We measured stonefly growth rates after 10 d of conditioning on Baetis bicaudatus (Ephemeroptera) or one of two alternative mayfly prey species in replicated circular plexiglass flow through chambers powered by water from a stream in western Colorado. We then compared attacks per encounter (as an index of predator choice) of conditioned stoneflies to those of unconditioned controls given equal densities of all three prey types. We conducted additional behavioral observations to determine whether predators differentially encountered the alternative prey types on natural substrates, and to determine whether predator-prey microhabitat overlap was a mechanism explaining differential prey encounter rates among prey species. Megarcys exhibited a stereotyped attack bias toward swimming mayflies, such as Baetis, following the simple rule, ''attack any prey that swim,'' which results in Megarcys' selection of prey types that swim in response to stonefly encounters. This behavior remained unmodified after extended experience with alternate but palatable nonswimming mayfly species. A potential fitness advantage (measured as relative growth rate) of this behavioral specialization occurred for female Megarcys, but not for males. Female Megarcys grew faster on Baetis diets because they ate more Baetis, not because Baetis was a more intrinsically profitable prey item (in terms of promoting predator growth). Further, high feeding rates on Baetis were a result of disproportionately high encounter rates and attacks per encounter with Baetis compared to the other mayfly species. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that this predatory behavior arose and is maintained in female stoneflies due to a fitness advantage to individuals specializing on a relatively abundant, easily recognized prey resource. We speculate that this specialized behavior has not been lost in male stoneflies, for which we did not measure a fitness advantage, because there is no strong selection pressure against it. Effective pre-and post-contact prey defenses may exert enough selection pressure to prevent stoneflies from evolving specialization on alternative mayfly types.

AB Annual C inputs from plant production in terrestrial ecosystems only meet the maintenance energy requirements of soil microorganisms, allowing for little or no net annual increase in their biomass. Because microbial growth within soil is limited by C availability, we reasoned that plant production should, in part, control the biomass of soil microorganisms. We also reasoned that soil texture should further modify the influence of plant production on soil C availability because fine-textured soils typically support more microbial biomass than coarse-textured soils. To test these ideas, we quantified the relationship between aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and soil microbial biomass in late-successional ecosystems distributed along a continent-wide gradient in North America. We also measured labile pools of C and N within the soil because they represent potential substrate for microbial activity. Ecosystems ranged from a Douglas-fir forest in the western United States to the grasslands of the mid-continent to the hardwood forests in the eastern U,S. Estimates of ANPP obtained from the literature ranged from 82 to 1460 g.m(-2).yr(-1).
   Microbial biomass C and N were estimated by the fumigation-incubation technique. Labile soil pools of C and N and first-order rate constants for microbial respiration and net N mineralization were estimated using a long-term (32 wk) laboratory incubation. Regression analyses were used to relate ANPP and soil texture with microbial biomass and labile soil C and N pools. Microbial biomass carbon ranged from 2 g/m(2) in the desert grassland to 134 g/m(2) in the tallgrass prairie; microbial N displayed a similar trend among ecosystems. Labile C pools, derived from a first-order rate equation, ranged from 115 g/m2 in the desert grassland to 491 g/m2 in the southern hardwood forest. First-order rate constants for microbial respiration (k) fell within a narrow range of values (0.180 to 0.357 wk(-1)), suggesting that labile C pools were chemically similar among this diverse set of ecosystems. Potential net N mineralization rates over the 32-wk incubation were linear in most ecosystems with first-order responses only in the alpine tundra, tallgrass prairie, and forests. Microbial biomass C displayed a positive,linear relationship with ANPP (r(2) = 0.51), but was not significantly related to soil texture. Labile C also was linearly related to ANPP (r(2) = 0.32) and to soil texture (r(2) = 0.33), Results indicate that microbial biomass and labile organic matter pools change predictably across broad gradients of ANPP, supporting the idea that microbial growth in soil is constrained by C availability,

AB We examined density dependence in population attributes and community impact of a generalist predator by experimentally mimicking natural variation in initial cohort densities produced by synchronous egg hatch in Mantis religiosa (Mantodea: Mantidae). Mantid cohorts within the normal range of emergence from a single egg mass were established in a replicated, well-controlled open field experiment. On the scale of the progeny from a single female, density-dependent food limitation caused mortality and ontogenetic asynchrony to increase with increasing density. All cohorts converged to a common level of abundance and biomass because both development rate and population size declined with increasing initial density.
   Numbers and biomass of other arthropods generally declined with increasing initial density of mantids, although there were both positive and negative effects on different taxa. The abundance of hemipterans (almost exclusively herbivorous mirids) increased in the presence of mantids; this was an indirect effect as large in magnitude as any of the direct reductions in abundance of other taxa. Per capita interaction strengths of mantids on most taxa generally were weak except for the strong positive interaction with hemipterans. In spite of different mantid development rates among treatments, predator load (proportion of arthropod biomass present as predators) for all three treatments, attributable mainly to mantid biomass, converged to approximately five times control level by the end of the experiment. The differences in predator loads between control and treatment plots thus may represent different levels of predator saturation: one for control plots, where predator load was constant over time and in which generalists contributed relatively little to predator biomass, and a higher one for treatment plots, in which generalists comprised the bulk of predator biomass. Predator load may therefore be an indicator of the relative importance of generalist vs. specialist predators in terrestrial arthropod assemblages.

AB The detection and significance of higher order interactions (HOIs) between species has been a matter of debate and experimentation in community ecology for several decades. HOIs are considered potentially significant because their presence is assumed to mean that the dynamic behavior of a full community of species is unpredictable based on observations of interactions between subsets of the species within the community. Despite such attention, the causal mechanisms that produce HOIs have been inadequately discussed. We discuss three different usages of the term HOIs and provide insight as to why HOIs might be found within a given community. HOIs may be detected for three reasons: inappropriate assumptions made concerning species interactions that influence statistical tests, unmeasured parameters and variables, and interaction modifications (i.e., a functional change in the interaction of two species caused by a third species).
   This confusion concerning the defining attributes of HOIs has made their detection problematic. While the statistical tests being used in the ecological experiments to detect HOIs are described in detail in most papers, the dynamic models underlying these tests are often not made explicit. Additionally, we demonstrate the equivalency of three different statistical tests: the Case and Bender (1981) test, analysis of variance, and a multiplicative test(Wootton 1994). However, the choice of a response variable (i.e., population densities, population growth rates, per-capita growth rates, etc.) and different data transformations applied to these response variables alter the underlying dynamics model that is being tested. The result is that the statistical test applied does not always perform the intended comparison but instead tests a different and sometimes unjustified or even inappropriate dynamic model.
   Finally, we review the relationship between indirect effects and HOIs. Whereas some researchers have lumped HOIs and indirect effects, we argue that the two represent completely unique and separate phenomena. Additionally, indirect effects can complicate detection of HOIs, and we review several methods by which to separate the two processes.

AB Habitat differences in variables describing food web structure were examined using data from two food web compilations, taking into account differences between webs in species richness and using independent data points only. Log-log regressions of connectance, linkage density, and food chain length on species number were calculated. In most cases these relationships were significant. The residuals from the regression lines were used to analyze differences between habitats in connectance, linkage density, and food chain length. In one compilation of insect-dominated webs, aquatic habitats had comparatively high connectance and linkage density when species number had been accounted for. In the other compilation, marine pelagic webs had higher relative connectance, relative linkage density, and mean chain length. In addition, desert webs had higher relative connectance. Several of the results when taking species richness into account do not agree with previous studies. Therefore it is concluded that it is important in examinations of food web patterns to account for web species number and to use independent observations as far as possible.

AB Along a gradient of increasing productivity in lakes, the abundance of perch (Perca fluviatilis) first increases and then decreases, whereas the abundance of ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) and that of roach (Rutilus rutilus) continue to increase. Perch, unlike roach and ruffe, undergoes dramatic ontogenetic diet shifts. The decrease in the abundance of perch along the productivity gradient may be due to competition from roach at its plankton-feeding stage and from ruffe at its benthic-macroinvertebrate-feeding stage. Previous studies of these three species have focused on the effects of roach on the other species. To further examine the competitive relationships among these species, we studied the effect of increasing the density of ruffe, while maintaining a relatively high, constant density of roach, on the diet and growth of perch. Food resources were also monitored during this 2-mo experiment, which was conducted in 10 enclosures in a pond in southern Sweden. Based on prior experiments we expected roach, an efficient planktivore, to reduce the biomass of zooplankton in all enclosures. Moreover, we expected that the increased density of benthic-feeding ruffe would force perch to increase its consumption of zooplankton, resulting in reduced growth.
   We found, as predicted, that the biomass of cladocerans and copepods decreased over time but was not affected by ruffe density. The biomass of the commonly consumed macroinvertebrates Sialis (a megalopteran), trichopterans, and ephemeropterans was lower in enclosures with ruffe than in enclosures without ruffe. Moreover, the biomass of Sialis decreased and that of chironomids and the clam Pisidium increased over time. High ruffe densities were related to an increased proportion of zooplankton in the diet of perch in August, but not in September. The diet of ruffe changed little along the ruffe gradient. Only the proportion of trichopterans (in August) and Pisidium (in September) in the diet of ruffe increased along the ruffe gradient. The growth of both perch and ruffe decreased with increasing ruffe density, whereas the growth of roach was constant. These data suggest that one reason perch decrease in abundance along a productivity gradient may be because they are competitively sandwiched between planktivore and benthivore specialists.

AB Beaver (Castor canadensis) affect biogeochemical cycles and the accumulation and distribution of chemical elements over time and space by altering the hydrologic regime. Aerial photograph analyses of beaver activities on the 298-km(2) Kabetogama Peninsula, Minnesota, were coupled with site-specific studies of soil and pore water concentrations of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) and other ions (potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, sulfate, chloride), nitrogen cycling processes (nitrogen fixation and denitrification), and biophysical environmental variables (vegetation, temperature, organic matter, soil structure, pH, and oxidation-reduction potential). Our analyses demonstrate that beaver influence the distribution, standing stocks, and availability of chemical elements by hydrologically induced alteration of biogeochemical pathways and by shifting element storage from forest vegetation to sediments and soils.
   Over the 63 yr of aerial photo records (1927-1988), beaver converted 13% of the peninsula to meadows and ponds. Elemental concentrations in soils (in micrograms per cubic centimetre) and in pore water (in milligrams per litre) revealed complex patterns within and among the principal hydrologic zones (e.g., forest, moist meadow, wet meadow, pond, stream). Principal components analysis (PCA) suggested that anaerobic conditions caused by saturation of soil by water was the fundamental control over subsequent alterations of biogeochemical pathways. Although few clear statistical trends were detected for mass- or volume-specific elemental concentrations among habitats, organic horizon (O and A) depths were greatest in the wet meadows and ponds (>15 cm), causing the standing stocks of chemical elements to be greatest there. We argue that the net effect of beaver activities has been to translocate chemical elements from the originally inundated upland forest vegetation to downstream communities and to pond sediments. As the upland vegetation dies and decays after dam construction, only a portion of the chemical elements are exported downstream (except for calcium and magnesium) or returned to the atmosphere (C and N only). Consequently, the organic horizons of pond sediments accumulate substantial standing stocks of chemical elements that are available for vegetative growth when darns fail, the ponds drain, and meadows are formed. Since 1927 beaver activities have augmented the standing stock of chemical elements in the organic horizons by 20-295%, depending on the element. These influences are spatially extensive and long lasting, affecting fundamental environmental characteristics of boreal forest drainage networks for decades to centuries.

AB We examined the hypothesis that environmentally induced alteration of immunocompetence is a primary physiological mechanism by which population survival is regulated. The involvement of disease and immunocompetence in the regulation of small mammal populations is not well understood but a strong relationship between physiological stress and immunity has been demonstrated. Its involvement is further supported by several studies, which have provided evidence that survival, incidence of disease, and selected gross measures of immunity change temporally with density and season. We examined this hypothesis by documenting the existence of temporal alterations in selected measures of both humoral and cell-mediated immune function in a population of cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus), a species known to fluctuate widely in density, inhabiting a tallgrass prairie in central Oklahoma. A total of 310 cotton rats was collected from August 1989 to May 1991 (10 collections) using conventional live-trap methods. In addition to morphological characteristics of primary and secondary lymphoid organs, the ability of splenocytes to produce specific antibody in response to a single injection of sheep erythrocytes and to proliferate in response to in vitro exposure to mitogens was measured to assess immunocompetence. Whole blood was collected for the determination of total peripheral blood leukocyte counts, packed cell volume, and total serum proteins. Statistically significant differences in all variables except total serum protein existed among the 10 collections and most of this variability was independent of specific seasonal time periods. Bimodal rhythmicity was characteristic of temporal changes for several measures of immunocompetence. Changes over time in the average immunocompetence of this population could have reflected a shift in genotypic polymorphism; several other plausible explanations are offered to explain the observed temporal patterns.

AB Zeiraphera canadensis Mut. & Free. (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) is an early season folivore that feeds exclusively on young foliage of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss). Most first-instar larvae are unable to colonize vigorous upper-crown apical buds due to the limited time during which newly burst buds are suitable to young larvae and the distinct acropetal bud development pattern exhibited by white spruce. However, late second- and early third-instar larvae abandon buds from the lower and middle crown and disperse to upper-crown apical buds once they become available for colonization. We carried out a 3-yr field study to test the hypothesis that ''acropetal'' dispersal by late second- and early third-instar Z. canadensis larvae through the crown of white spruce is an adaptive response to within-plant variability in foliage development.
   Survival and the size and developmental rate of survivors were highest when larvae developed on apical buds in the upper crown. Smaller buds located more proximally and/ or lower in the crown declined in quality earlier than did the larger buds in the upper crown. Larvae that developed in buds with several conspecifics survived better, were larger, and developed faster than those that developed alone. Intraspecific larval competition was evident only at the highest densities, where the entire apical bud unit was consumed. Individuals allowed to develop for two instars on buds from the lower crown before being transferred acropetally to complete development on apical buds once they became available, always survived better, were larger, and developed faster than nontransferred larvae, irrespective of initial bud position and/or larval density. In addition, acropetal dispersal did not increase the probability of mortality from Formica ants, the most common predators found foraging on young white spruce. Including the costs and benefits associated with competition and predation, the performance of individuals that were restricted to developing within even the highest quality upper-crown apical buds (i.e., alternative strategy) was lower than for individuals that were allowed to feed twice on new foliage (i.e., the observed strategy). Thus, acropetal dispersal increases individual fitness in a heterogeneous environment where the quality and quantity of required plant resources varies spatially and temporally.

AB Recent optimality models of host-parasitoid associations have assumed that host quality varies with host size or age at parasitism. This is based on the fact that larger hosts provide more resources, making size a reliable indicator of the amount of resources available for parasitoid development. Few studies have examined this in parasitoids that allow their hosts to continue development after parasitism (koinobiont parasitoids). In this study we compared growth trajectories of the koinobiont ichneumonid endoparasitoid Venturia canescens developing in four larval instars of one of its hosts, the moth Plodia interpunctella. Hosts were reared with excess food and parasitized as late second, third, fourth, and fifth instars. Hosts were dissected at intervals after parasitism, and host and parasitoid dry mass determined. The survivorship, development time, and size of eclosing adult wasps were also monitored. Hosts parasitized by Venturia continued to grow and become prepupae, although their maximum masses were progressively smaller the earlier that the hosts were parasitized: second-instar (L2) hosts grew to 70% of control (unparasitized) size, while L4 and L5 hosts reached control size. The maximum larval dry mass, as well as eclosing adult size, varied with host instar at parasitism. Venturia larvae spent prolonged periods as first instars when developing from L2 hosts and grew most rapidly during early stages in L5 larvae. The data shaw that for Venturia, host duality is not a direct function of host size at parasitism. Furthermore, the pattern of development shown by Venturia differs markedly from that shown by aphidiid koinobiont parasitoids.

AB The Serengeti ecosystem contains some of Africa's most geobotanically diverse landscapes and supports some of the highest primary and secondary production on Earth. In an attempt to characterize landscape patterns in soil microbial processes across the Serengeti, 17 study sites from nine landscape regions were sampled for soil physical/chemical characteristics and laboratory determination of soil microbial biomass, 20-d net turnover rates of carbon and nitrogen, and respiratory and nitrogen mineralization dispenses to carbon and nitrogen amendments.
   A large variation in soil physical/chemical characteristics across landscapes and a high degree of intercorrelation among these soil properties were found. Soil microbial biomass carbon ranged from 587 to 3971 mu g/g soil dry mass, constituting between 3.4 and 9.4% of the total soil carbon at the Central Hills and Southern Plains landscape sites, respectively. Soil respiration rates (as carbon loss per unit soil dry mass) ranged from 9 pg g(-1).d(-1) in the Northwest to 57 mu g.g(-1) d(-1) on the Southern Plains and were positively correlated with soil microbial biomass. Regression models incorporating percent water-holding capacity and total organic carbon were highly predictive of levels of microbial biomass and soil respiration across all landscapes.
   Net nitrogen mineralization rates per unit soil dry mass, averaging between -0.48 and 1.09 mu g.g(-1) d(-1), were positively correlated with soil respiration rates, but unrelated to soil mineral nitrogen pools or soil microbial biomass. (NH4)(2)SO4 additions significantly reduced both soil respiration rates and net nitrogen mineralization rates, but significantly increased net nitrate production, suggesting that nitrification is limited, in part, by ammonium availability.
   Low phosphorus availability may not only restrict nitrate production, but also limit ammonium production, thus having fundamental impacts on the nitrogen economy in this ecosystem. The interaction between N and P cycling is likely most significant in the tallgrass Northwest and Northeast landscapes, where granitic, P-deficient parent materials predominate, and nitrogen competition between plants and soil microbes limits aboveground nitrogen flow. On the Southern, Southeast, and Northwest Plains, where grazing intensity is greatest, soils have the highest levels of soil microbial biomass and lower C:P ratios, and microbial growth and nitrogen turnover rates appeared to be more C than N limited. The Eastern and Western Corridor, which support lower levels of sustained, intensive grazing, showed intermediate levels of soil microbial biomass and carbon and nitrogen turnover rates.
   The observation that mean annual rainfall is positively correlated with net primary production but negatively correlated with soil fertility across African savannas is supported by our data, which generally show that regional patterns of soil fertility and soil microbial processes are negatively correlated with mean annual rainfall across the Serengeti. We found soil microbial processes to be closely correlated with landscape patterns of herbivore use and intensity of herbivory. Herbivores track plant growth, which is highly variable both temporally and spatially, and in doing so, profoundly impact nutrient cycling processes where they feed. Thus, the bursts in soil microbial processes and plant growth that follow rainfall events are accompanied by the direct impact of herbivores on these processes.

TI MARKOV-RECAPTURE POPULATION ESTIMATES - A TOOL FOR IMPROVING
   INTERPRETATION OF TRAPPING EXPERIMENTS

AB This paper describes a method of population estimation in which a random, unknown number of individuals is marked using a self-marking bait station (a trap modified for mark and release); animals (both marked and unmarked) may then be captured in an otherwise identical trap, which is available simultaneously. The estimate of the unknown population size is based on the assumption of a closed population and a simple Markov model in which the rates of marking and capture are assumed to be equal. The population size estimator is based on the maximum likelihood technique, and is given by the next integer less than N = (C + R)(2)/2(R + 1)' where R and C are, respectively, the numbers of marked and unmarked individuals found in the trap. The estimator is almost unbiased for a wide range of true population sizes, and over a wide range of times over which the experiment is run, although it becomes negatively biased when the mean number of recaptures is <5. Confidence limits may be obtained using asymptotic maximum likelihood arguments, although relative likelihood methods perform better when the number of recaptures is small.

AB In a fragmented, dry subtropical forest in northwestern Argentina, we compared pollination levels, fruit set, and seed set among small (<1 ha) forest fragments, large (>2 ha) fragments, and continuous forest in 16 plant species representing a wide range of pollination systems, breeding systems, and growth forms. For three species, Prosopis nigra (Mimosoideae), Cercidium australe (Caesalpinoideae), and Atamisquea emarginata (Capparaceae), the three treatments were replicated across four sites; we achieved less replication for other species. Because comparisons between forest and fragment populations for different species took place in different sites, however, by treating all 16 species as a unit we lessened the potential bias of confounding site effects and could evaluate the overall impact of fragmentation.
   Significant or marginal (P < .10) fragmentation-related declines in number of pollen tubes per style, fruit set, and seed set occurred in 9 of 16, 5 of 15, and 3 of 14 species, respectively. Overall, significant or nonsignificant declines occurred in 81%(pollen tubes), 73% (fruit set), and 79% (seed set) of the species. In all cases these proportions were greater (P less than or equal to.06) than the null binomial expectation of a 1:1 ratio of increases to decreases. Breeding system did not explain sensitivity to fragmentation: the magnitudes of declines in pollen tubes, fruit set, and seed set were virtually indistinguishable between self-compatible and self-incompatible species. At least 4 of the 10 self-incompatible species, however, were heavily visited in small fragments by Africanized honey bees, which may have compensated for a decline in visits by native pollinators.
   The exact nature of responses varied among plant species. In some, the absolute quantity of pollen grains transferred to stigmas decreased with fragmentation, and sometimes this was reflected in reduced fruit or seed set. In Cercidium, Prosopis, and Atamisquea, the quality of the grains transferred apparently changed: number of pollen tubes produced per pollen grain on the stigma declined with increasing fragmentation, and at least in the latter two species seed production declined as well.
   Overall, levels of pollination and seed production undoubtedly integrated many idiosyncratic effects of fragmentation on particular plant and animal populations, and indicated that ''community health'' of fragments suffered in comparison with that of continuous forest. Median decreases in pollination levels and seed output from forest to fragments approached 20%. The impact of these declines on plant recruitment is less clear, however, because cattle grazing and trampling of seedlings and saplings in fragments may constitute a much more serious short-term conservation problem.

AB In this article I examine moose-wolf interactions over a broad spectrum of moose densities with the primary objective to test empirically whether wolf predation can regulate moose numbers. I also present four conceptual models of moose population dynamics and outline their specific predictions. Based on 27 studies where moose were the dominant prey species, the functional and numerical responses of wolves to changing moose density were derived using an hyperbolic, Michaelis-Menten function. Per capita killing rate was strongly related (P = .01) to moose density, as was the density of wolves (P < .01). Killing rate plateaued at 3.36 moose.wolf(-1) (100 days)(-1) when predators were fully satiated. The asymptotic value for wolf density was 58.7 animals/1000 km(2). Wolf predation rate, as derived from the total predator response, proved to be density dependent from 0 to 0.65 moose/km(2), and inversely density dependent at higher moose densities. Predator: prey ratios reflected wolf predation rate poorly because they did not integrate the functional response. An empirical model based on these results suggests that moose would stabilize at 2.0 moose/km(2) in the absence of predators, and at approximate to 1.3 moose/km(2) in the presence of a single predator, the wolf. Density-dependent food competition creates these two high-density equilibrium conditions. If moose productivity is diminished through either deteriorating habitat quality or bear-induced early calf mortality, then a low-density equilibrium (0.2-0.4 moose/km(2)) is predicted. The model also suggests that when a low equilibrium develops, a ''predator pit'' is absent or extremely shallow, thus arguing against the appropriateness of a predation-food two-state model. Further research on the density relationship of bear predation, on the effect of alternate prey on wolf total response, and on the regulatory impact of food competition at high moose densities, is required for a full understanding of moose demography.

AB We measured acorn production by individual oaks of five different species at Hastings Reservation in central coastal California between 1980 and 1991. Variation in acorn production was considerable both within and among years and was generally uncorrelated between species. Compared to expected values, variance within years in the size of acorn crops was small, while variance among years was high. Crop failures occurred fairly frequently and large crops in successive years were observed, but no more than expected by chance. Individual trees masted at species-specific intervals, but these patterns did not result in regular masting cycles at the population level.
   We compared these patterns to predictions of four hypotheses for the evolution of seed production patterns. Observations did not support the hypotheses that production patterns track resource availability (the ''resource matching'' hypothesis) or that they have evolved to attract seed dispersers (the ''seed dispersal'' hypothesis). However, they are generally consistent with two additional hypotheses, that masting in these wind-pollinated species evolved because of a proportional increase in fertilization and seed set during mast years (the ''wind pollination'' hypothesis) and that masting has evolved to maximize the probability of avoiding predation via predator satiation (the ''predator satiation'' hypothesis).

AB We excavated and mapped the lateral extension of 32 creosotebush shrubs (Larrea tridentata) in the Chihuahuan desert of New Mexico to examine the effect of neighborhood interaction on root distribution. The smallest closed-angle polygon encompassing all roots of an individual was taken as a representation of its root system. Several geometrical characteristics of these polygons were measured and compared to interference vectors based on the location and size of the neighbors. We found that root systems were more developed away from the maximum competitive pressure of neighbors. Relation between root system shape and pressure from neighbors was stronger when the competitive vectors were integrating effect from all neighbors. Size of neighbors did not appear to contribute significantly to the relation. The resulting spatial pattern tended to reduce the overlap between neighboring root systems. Two conceptual models of root growth response to neighbors appear to explain our results. Both models assume that when the root system of neighbors meet, root growth is impaired or ceases at the zone of contact. In the nonoverlapping, non-compensatory model, the decrease in root growth between two close neighbors is not compensated elsewhere, possibly affecting the overall plant performance. In the non-overlapping, compensatory model, a plant with a close neighbor responds by investing in root growth away from the competitive pressure or simply in zones free of neighbors. Under this model, two plants can be close to each other and not compete. Competition in the population is for space and only occurs when a plant root system is crowded on all sides.

AB We conducted a 456-d laboratory incubation of an old-growth coniferous forest soil to aid in the elucidation of C controls on N cycling processes in forest soils. Gross rates of N mineralization, immobilization, and nitrification were measured by N-15 isotope dilution, and net rates of N mineralization and nitrification were calculated from changes in KCl-extractable inorganic N and NO3- -N pool sizes, respectively. Changes in the availability of C were assessed by monitoring rates of CO2 evolution and the sizes of extractable organic C and microbial biomass pools. Net and gross rates of N mineralization (r(2) = 0.038, P =.676) and nitrification (r(2) = 0.403, P =.125)were not significantly correlated over the course of the incubation, suggesting that the factors controlling N consumptive and productive processes do not equally affect these processes. A significant increase in the NO3- pool size (net nitrification) only occurred after 140 d, when the NO3- pool size increased suddenly and massively. However, gross nitrification rates were substantial throughout the entire incubation and were poorly correlated with these changes in NO(3)(-)pool sizes. Concurrent decreases in the microbial biomass suggest that large increases in NO3- pool sizes after prolonged incubation of coniferous forest soil may arise from reductions in the rate of microbial immobilization of NO3-, rather than from one of the mechanisms proposed previously (e.g., sequestering of NH4+ by microbial heterotrophs, the deactivation of allelopathic compounds, or large increases in autotrophic nitrifier populations). Strong correlations were found between rates of CO2 evolution and gross N mineralization (r(2) = 0.974, P <.0001) and immobilization (r(2) = 0.980, P <.0001), but not between CO2 evolution and net N mineralization rates. Microbial growth efficiency, determined by combining estimates of gross N immobilization, CO2 evolution, and microbial biomass C and N pool sizes, declined exponentially over the incubation. These results suggest the utilization of lower quality substrates as C availability declined during incubation. Results from this research indicate the measurement of gross rates of N transformations in soil provides a powerful tool for assessing C and N cycling relationships in forests.

AB As plants become nitrogen-limited in their growth, carbon/nutrient (C/N) theory predicts a decreasing allocation of nitrogen to nitrogen-intensive defense compounds, while optimal defense (OD) theory predicts an increasing allocation to defense; C/N theory predicts no alteration in allocation to defense after damage if the C:N ratio of the plant does not change, while OD theory does. We compare C/N and OD theory predictions for the inducible nicotine production of a native tobacco, Nicotiana sylvestris. We define allocation as the slope of the In-in allometric relationship between whole-plant nicotine and nicotine-free biomass in undamaged and damaged plants, harvested every other day in eight consecutive harvests. Relative growth, nitrogen, and nitrogen in nicotine accumulation rates (RGRs, RNARs, and RNicARs) were calculated to estimate the instantaneous investment of nitrogen in nicotine and in the growth of plant tissues.
   Nicotine accumulation continues during nitrogen stress, resulting in a 3.29-fold increase in the nicotine pools of undamaged plants, and is accelerated in response to leaf damage, resulting in a 4.06-fold increase in the nicotine pools of damaged plants. Nitrogen pool size did not change after day 2, and both undamaged and damaged plants allocated an increasing proportion of their nitrogen pool to nicotine throughout the experiment. Damage increased the allocation of nitrogen to nicotine; the slope of the In nicotine vs. In nicotine-free biomass regression for damaged plants was significantly greater (16.9%; P <.041) than the slope for undamaged plants as measured during the period of damage-induced nicotine accumulation (days 2-10 after damage). Allocation of nitrogen to nicotine accumulation is clearly not a passive function of the nitrogen in excess of growth requirements, and damage increases this allocation.
   Trade-offs between biomass and nicotine production over the course of the experiment between damaged and undamaged plants were not apparent. However, the short-term estimates indicate otherwise. On day 2, there was a significant decrease in RGR, with a correlated increase in RNicAR in response to damage, suggesting that there was a shortterm trade-off between allocation to growth and nicotine accumulation or other induced processes. By the end of the experiment, each damaged plant had accumulated 0.595 mg N in nicotine above that accumulated by undamaged plants, an additional investment representing 1.94% of the total nitrogen pool. However, 2 d after damage, damaged plants allocated 0.131 mg more N to nicotine than undamaged plants, representing a short-term investment of 17.7% of the nitrogen potentially made available by the decrease in RCR (0.740 mg). Plants invest substantial portions of their nitrogen in an induced defense, but our estimates do not include the nitrogen costs of production, storage, transport, detoxification, or the indirect costs of this induced defense.

AB Element dynamics (C, N, P, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, and Al) were examined along a decay continuum from freshly fallen litter to soil organic matter in a red spruce ecosystem in Maine. The continuum was defined using previously reported data on litterfall chemistry and the early stages (i.e., first 24 mo) of decay, combined with new studies on an additional 33 mo of decay and an evaluation of forest floor organic matter at the same site. Carbon concentrations decreased over time as fresh litter was transformed into soil organic matter; N, Fe, and Al concentrations increased; and P, Ca, Mg, and Mn concentrations showed variable patterns of increase and decrease. In general, homogeneity of the litter increased as fresh litter of different initial chemistries was transformed into chemically more uniform soil organic matter. Ecosystem budgets indicated that after 57 mo of decay, litter had lost 63% of its original mass and had released C (65%), N(17%), P (79%), Ca (50%), Mg (80%), and Mn (74%), and had accumulated Al (431%) and Fe (353%). Evidence is presented indicating that the retention of Al (and Fe) is, primarily controlled by abiotic adsorption onto litter exchange sites. Overall results are consistent with a two-phase model of decay: in the first phase (0 to 3-4 yr), mass loss fits a negative exponential model of decay, an inverse linear relationship exists between N concentration and mass loss, and rapid changes are observed in litter chemistry; the second phase (3-4 + yr) is characterized by markedly slower changes in mass loss and litter chemistry.

AB To test the prediction that a mutation causing greater reproductive effort will result in reduced vegetative vigor, we compared the seed production, growth, and carbohydrate status of normal and pistillate genotypes of the grass Tripsacum dactyloides differing in seed production by up to fourfold. We evaluated the costs of reproduction by two methods: experimental manipulation of reproductive effort and comparison of high- and low-yielding genotypes. Despite the large difference in seed production, normal and pistillate (high-yielding) genotypes did not differ in growth rate over a 1-yr period. Contrary to predictions, carbohydrate reserves in the high-yielding genotype were significantly higher at the peak of the seed ripening period. Stalk defoliation and complete removal of seed stalks reduced plant growth rate, total aboveground biomass, and biomass of vegetative storage organs, especially when plants were also under stress from biweekly defoliation. However, stalk removal caused increased rates of growth in the year after experimental manipulations. Reproductive tillers were costly to the plant in terms of lost meristems and therefore future plant size, but seed costs were contained within reproductive tillers of both genotypes, explaining the lack of a trade-off in the high-yielding, pistillate genotype. Although experimental reduction of reproductive effort revealed a cost of reproduction, this result could not be used to correctly predict the consequences of a gene for greater seed production.

AB Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are a novel and abundant potential food source for several species of diving ducks in the Great Lakes region. Using predator exclusion cages, behavioral observations, and analyses of duck gizzard contents, we examined the predator-prey relationship between zebra mussels and their duck predators during the fall migratory period in Lake Erie at Point Pelee, Ontario. Diving ducks feeding on zebra mussels in the area reduced mussel biomass by 57% during the period of heaviest feeding, but had no measurable impact on mussel numbers. Birds were size-selective predators, preferentially taking medium and large mussels over the more common small ones, thereby altering the size structure of the mussel population. Ducks were abundant at Point Pelee only during late fall, and differences between cages and control areas had disappeared by the following spring. Overall, ducks had little lasting impact on mussel populations, but mussel abundance may have determined duck concentration in the area. Duck staging populations were higher in 1990, when mussels were more abundant, than in 1991, when mussels were much scarcer. Effective predator control of zebra mussels in the portion of the Great Lakes region that freezes over winter is unlikely because diving ducks are unable to overwinter in the area. However, mussels have become an important food source for diving ducks, and temporary reductions of mussel density through predation are likely in areas where ducks feed during migratory periods. Similarly, in regions where ducks are resident through winter, greater and longer lasting effects may be observed.

AB Light is never distributed homogeneously since it forms a gradient over biomass. As a consequence, the common theories on nutrient competition are not applicable to competition for light. In this paper, we investigate a model for light-limited growth and competition among phytoplankton species in a mixed water column. The model is based on standard assumptions such as Lambert-Beer's law of light absorption, a Monod equation for carbon uptake, and constant specific carbon losses. By introducing the concept of quantum return, we show that the dynamics of growth and competition can be quantified not only in terms of depth but also directly in terms of light availability. We argue that the crucial measure for phytoplankton growth is not a ''critical depth'' but a ''critical light intensity,'' I-out*. For each species, I-out* corresponds to the equilibrium light intensity at the bottom of a water column when the species is grown in monoculture. I-out* plays a role similar to the ''critical nutrient concentration'' R* used in models of nutrient-limited growth. For a constant light supply, the species with the lowest I-out* will competitively exclude all other species. There are, however, some important differences between R* and I-out*. Whereas R* reflects both the local and the total balance between nutrient uptake and nutrient losses, I-out* only reflects the total carbon balance. Moreover, I-out* decreases with increasing light supply, whereas R* is independent of the nutrient supply. As a consequence, (1) the outcome of competition for light may depend on the light supply, (2) the compensation point is not a good predictor for the outcome of competition, (3) the resource ratio hypothesis does not apply when species compete for both nutrients and light. The outcome of competition for nutrients and light may depend on the nutrient and light supply, on the mixing depth, and on the background turbidity due to inanimate substances.

AB We studied the effect of nitrogen supply (3.3 and 20.0 g.m(-2).yr(-1)) on the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of three Carer species that differ in maximum growth rate. The rank order of maximum growth rate of these species is: Carex diandra less than or equal to Carex rostrata < Carer acutiformis;. We distinguished two components of NUE: the mean residence time of nitrogen (MRT) in the plant and the nitrogen productivity (A). In this concept, NUE equals the product of MRT and A, and thus equals total productivity divided by the total N loss in litter.
   The N productivity (A) of C. diandra was significantly higher than that of C. rostrata and C. acutiformis. In each species A decreased strongly at enhanced N supply. The MRT of N differed substantially between species, but was not significantly affected by N supply. Contrary to what is generally found, the species with the lowest maximum growth rate (C. diandra) had the highest N turnover rate (lowest MRT), while the species with the highest maximum growth rate (C. acutiformis) had the lowest N turnover rate (highest MRT). In all species, the NUE decreased with increasing N supply. As a result of the observed patterns in N productivity and mean residence time, the species with the lowest maximum growth rate (C. diandra) had the lowest nitrogen use efficiency, while the species with the highest maximum growth rate (C. acutiformis) had the highest NUE. These results are not in agreement with the generally observed patterns in NUE along gradients of primary productivity.
   Comparisons of the results of this study with those of other studies show that generalizations of patterns of NUE along gradients of primary productivity should explicitly take into account which growth forms are compared (evergreen species vs. deciduous species, or [congeneric] species with the same growth form). Moreover, this study shows that factoring NUE into its components is a useful tool in the analysis of the adaptive significance of the N economy of plants.

AB We can compare natural communities with null models of communities to indicate how they differ from random assemblages of species (i.e., how much structure is present). However, because null models draw on observed values of species' prevalences, whatever structure already exists in natural communities affects the composition of a null model and weakens its comparative power. To address this, we developed formulae to estimate ''pre-interactive'' species prevalences permitting a more sensitive quantification of community structure. Nonetheless, if a null model deviates from the community that we base it on, it is difficult to separate the effects of heterogeneity in recruitment from competition. We have developed a method to test for each independently. Applying our analytical techniques to a well-studied guild of larval trematodes in the salt marsh snail Cerithidea californica revealed that competitive interactions among species were the most significant structuring force. Interestingly, spatial heterogeneity acted to significantly intensify species co-occurrences. This differs from previous studies, which argued that the isolating effects of spatial heterogeneity, not competition, structure these communities by reducing co-occurrences.

AB We examined the indirect effects of insectivorous birds on plant growth through consumption of leaf-chewing insects in a Missouri Ozark deciduous forest. Over a period of 2 yr, we compared insect numbers, leaf damage, and resultant plant growth for control saplings of white oak (Quercus alba), vs. saplings that we caged to limit access by insectivorous birds but not herbivorous insects. In a third treatment, we sprayed insecticide on young white oak trees to determine the impact of the insect herbivores on plant growth in the presence of birds. The total number of insects encountered on plants inside of cages was twice that on control plants for both years. Insecticide spraying reduced herbivore numbers substantially but did not eliminate them. As a result of the treatments, cage plants suffered 25% leaf area loss, control plants 13%, and spray plants 6% at the end of the first season (34, 24, and 9%, respectively, for the 2nd yr). As a result of the differences in damage, cage plants produced one-third less total aboveground biomass compared to insecticide-treated plants, with control plants producing intermediate values. Differences in biomass production were due mainly to decreased leaf biomass, which in turn was associated with decreased leaf size in subsequent years as a result of high damage during the previous year.
   This is the first terrestrial ecosystem study to demonstrate a significant impact of insectivorous birds on plant growth. Our results suggest that over the long term observed declines in North American populations of insectivorous birds may reduce forest productivity because of potentially higher numbers of leaf-chewing insects and the concomitant negative effect on plant growth.

AB The purpose of this investigation was to accomplish a simultaneous evaluation of both the costs and benefits of mixed-species foraging for a socially subordinate species. Specifically, we studied Carolina Chickadees that commonly forage in winter with a socially dominant congener, the Tufted Titmouse. We prevented these species from foraging together by removing titmice from five central Ohio woodlots. We then compared the biology of chickadees on these sites to that of chickadees on four sites where titmice had not been removed. Where titmice had been removed, chickadees foraged in more titmouse-like locations. Although this shift was statistically significant for two of the five niche parameters measured, there was a consistent pattern of shifts toward the titmouse niche in all five. We were unable to detect a change in chickadee vigilance in the absence of titmice. Chickadees showed statistically greater induced feather growth in the absence of titmice, indicating better nutritional condition, but we detected no differences in survival between treatment groups. We conclude that the foraging niche results provide evidence of a cost to chickadees of foraging with titmice. Furthermore, based on the feather growth results, we conclude that the costs and benefits for chickadees of this interaction sum to a net cost in foraging efficiency if not in survivorship.

AB Interactions between genotype and environment determine the underlying constitutive (background-level) resistance of individual plants to herbivory. Resistance, however, may change in response to herbivory (induced resistance). This study was designed to investigate temporal fluctuations in resistance, and to test the relative influences of constitutive and browsing-induced resistance on patterns of mammalian herbivory. A natural population of creosotebush, Larrea tridentata, browsed by black-tailed jackrabbits, Lepus californicus, served as the study system.
   Creosotebushes varied considerably in their resistance to jackrabbit browsing. Some individual plants were fed upon lightly and infrequently, while others had up to 90% of their living branches clipped during a single month, and were browsed several times per year. Resistance levels of individual shrubs were similar between seasons, and over time scales >2 yr. Shrubs with a history of heavy browsing (low constitutive resistance) were more likely to be browsed again than were individuals with a history of light browsing (high constitutive resistance). In an experiment designed to test jackrabbit response to constitutive resistance and recent browsing damage (artificially clipped vs. unclipped), the importance of both factors was confirmed. Jackrabbits browsed more heavily on plants with low than with high constitutive resistance, but less heavily on clipped shrubs than on controls. The enhanced resistance of clipped shrubs is interpreted as an induced response by individuals to herbivory, and may be responsible for variation in browsing levels of individual shrubs over time scales of 1-2 yr.

AB Microhabitat partitioning based on microhabitat-specific predation rates has been well documented as a mechanism of coexistence in desert rodents. In the Namib Desert, two species of rodent, a nocturnal dune hairy-footed gerbil, Gerbillurus tytonis, and a diurnal striped mouse, Rhabdomys pumilio, co-occur in a vegetated island in the dune sea. The species show a marked preference for the same microhabitat, although gerbils also inhabit a second microhabitat where predation risk is greater. We provide direct experimental evidence for the role of predation risk and both inter- and intraspecific competition in affecting foraging behavior and habitat selection of gerbils. Using two techniques (tracking and seed trays), we were able to show that gerbils decrease foraging activity in vegetated areas during periods of increased illumination (full-moon periods). Removal of a potential competitor, the striped mouse, as well as removal of conspecifics, resulted in a significant increase in gerbil foraging activity. We propose that high susceptibility to predation results in a shared preference for the safest habitat and leads to competition for limited resources.

AB Defense and regrowth after herbivore attack are not mutually exclusive alternatives for most plants, yet few studies have examined the coordination of the processes responsible for these two plant functions. To this end, we studied the coordination of alkaloidal and photosynthetic responses to simulated herbivory in the context of changes in leaf nitrogen in plants grown under a range of nitrate supply rates in two experiments. In the first experiment, damage-induced changes in leaf nicotine, total nitrogen, nitrate, and photosynthetic rate (PR) were monitored in same-aged undamaged leaves of young Nicotiana sylvestris plants grown in pots. In the second, the alkaloidal response to damage was uncoupled from damage by growing plants in pots for >150 d, causing them not to respond to leaf damage with increased nicotine concentrations (''uninducible'').
   We propose that the changes in PR and nicotine content induced by damage reflect the allocation of resources to regrowth and defense, respectively, and examine the predictions of the optimal defense (OD) theory regarding these responses. We have previously established that neither constitutive nor induced nicotine production is a passive consequence of a nitrogen imbalance in excess of growth requirements as is predicted by the carbon/nutrient (C/N) theory. If PR reflects the fitness value of the leaf and damage reflects a high probability of future damage, we interpret the OD theory to predict that PR and nicotine content should be correlated, and that damage should increase the amount of nicotine allocated for a given PR.
   Nicotine, nitrogen, and PR increased in a coordinated fashion in response to leaf damage in the inducible plants. In both experiments, PR and nitrogen were highly correlated, but damage did not affect the PR-nitrogen relationship. In the first experiment with inducible plants, nicotine and nitrogen were also highly correlated. However, damage significantly increased the slope of the nicotine-nitrogen relationship 1.6-fold. Similarly, nicotine and PR were significantly correlated and the slope of the nicotine-PR relationship increased significantly (1.9-fold) in response to damage. These results are consistent with the predictions of the OD theory.
   Despite this coordination, alkaloidal and photosynthetic responses can be uncoupled. Regardless of nitrate supply rate, damaged ''uninducible'' plants exhibited no significant increase in nicotine content, but significantly increased their PR in response to damage with a correlated increase in leaf nitrogen content. Nicotine and PR were not significantly correlated in undamaged plants, but were significantly correlated in damaged plants. Unless other defenses are activated in uninducible plants, these results may reflect a priority of growth over defense in uninducible plants with slow growth rates or reduced rooting volume.

Instead we use a method that separates the effects on patch choice of predator avoidance (site bias) from effects due to the resource ratio. Our experiment examines the distribution of foraging upland bullies (Gobiomorphus breviceps) between two resource sites over a series of five different food input ratios. We had two conditions, a predator-free and a predator condition. The bullies exhibited a strong bias (preference) towards Site 1 when there was no predator (quinnat salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). When a salmon was present at Site 1 they exhibited a strong bias towards the alternative resource site (Site 2). We estimated that it would be necessary to change the relative food availabilities by a factor of approximate to 28 to remove the effect of the presence of the predator. The slope of the distribution of bullies (their sensitivity to resource profitability) deviates from the Ideal Free prediction for both conditions. A trend in the slope of the distribution of the bullies between the predator-free and predator conditions suggested that the presence of a predator may alter the behavior of the bullies, By acknowledging that the distribution of foragers may deviate from Ideal Free, we demonstrate that it is possible to separate the effects of predator avoidance from a change in their ability to discriminate between resource sites caused by the presence of a predator.

AB Recent studies of nitrogen (N) cycling in arctic tundra have indicated that inorganic N supplied to plants by mineralization is not sufficient to meet the annual requirement of N by many tundra species. Whereas N mineralization is slow in tundra soils and concentrations of inorganic N are low, these soils have large stocks of both structural and soluble organic N. In light of these observations, kinetics of absorption of three amino acids (glycine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid) were measured in dominant vascular plant species of the four major ecosystem types in arctic Alaska and compared with concentrations of free amino acids in soils. Absorption rates were measured on roots using C-14-labeled substrates. Concentrations of free amino acids in soil were measured on water-extracted samples by high pressure liquid chromatography. All species had higher capacity (V-max) for ammonium uptake (measured using methylamine as an ammonium analogue) than for any amino acid. However, at concentrations observed in the field, uptake rates estimated for amino acids were similar to (glycine) or less than (aspartic and glutamic acids) that for ammonium. On the basis of these comparisons, uptake rates of the three amino acids together may account for between 10 and 82% of the total N uptake in the field, depending on species and community. Deciduous shrubs had higher uptake rates than the more slowly growing evergreen shrubs, suggesting that new growth created a sink that strongly influenced capacity for amino acid uptake. In general, ectomycorrhizal species had higher amino acid uptake than did non-mycorrhizal species. In species that were sampled from more than one community, amino acid uptake rates were highest in the community where a given amino acid was most abundant in the soil.
   The results indicate that, in arctic tundra, plants short-circuit the mineralization step of decomposition by directly absorbing amino acids. This implies that in the organic soils of these tundra systems (1) inorganic nitrogen is an inadequate measure of plant-available soil nitrogen, (2) mineralization rates underestimate nitrogen supply rates to plants, (3) the large differences among species in capacities to absorb different forms of N provide ample basis for niche differentiation of what was previously considered a single resource, and (4) by short-circuiting N mineralization, plants accelerate N turnover and effectively exert greater control over N cycling than has been previously recognized.

AB Little is known about how inbreeding depression and maternal effects change from the seed stage through offspring maturation or how these patterns differ for plants germinated under natural vs. artificial conditions. I measured these effects in perennial Aquilegia caerulea (Ranuncuiaceae) for both field-sown plants and greenhouse-sown progeny that were subsequently transplanted to the field. Overall, field-sown plants and transplants showed similar cumulative inbreeding depression, averaging 0.54 and 0.52, respectively. Selfed individuals had a lower success than outcrossed individuals in all fitness components measured from the number of seeds produced by the cross to size at year 3, and most effects were significant. Inbreeding depression in survival was worse for field-sown progeny in which mortality was much higher. Furthermore, effects of inbreeding on plant size increased each year for greenhouse-sown transplants, but not for field-sown plants, suggesting inbreeding depression is expressed later when survival is artificially high. The effect of seed mass was investigated in greenhouse-sown individuals. Although selfed seeds weighed significantly less than outcrossed seeds, seed mass was not correlated with emergence or survival. It did, however, correlate with leaf expansion rate, which, in turn, correlated with year 3 size in both transplants and field-sown plants. Maternal effects explained a much larger proportion of variance in seed mass than did level of inbreeding. In the greenhouse, effects of seed parent were strongest on early characters, becoming small and nonsignificant by year 3 when inbreeding effects again became significant. In contrast, maternal effects on juvenile traits of field-sown progeny were negligible.

AB One of the major questions in ecology is, what controls the structure of communities? We used projection matrix models to examine community dynamics and patterns of succession. The inputs of the model are transition probabilities of species replacements that were measured repeatedly during a long-term (1962-1989) study of diverse coral assemblages on Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef. Transitions varied strikingly among species and sites, reflecting differences in recruitment, growth, longevity (persistence), and the rate of replacement of one species by another. Species that had a poor ability to persist (e.g., algae and Pocilloporid corals) were generally good colonists. The observed number of transitions expressed as a proportion of the maximum number possible provides an index of the complexity of interactions in an assemblage, analogous to the concept of connectance in food-web analysis. Transitions occurred to and from nearly every species group, indicating that there was no competitive dominant in this system.
   We use the models in simulations to track transitory changes in species abundance and community composition following a major disturbance (e.g., due to a cyclone or outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish). Some species showed a rapid initial increase followed by a decline to lower equilibrium levels, while others increased smoothly to a generally higher equilibrial abundance. The length of time required to reach a climax assemblage using the same matrix recurrently (approximate to 20 yr) is far greater than the observed interval between major disturbances, supporting nonequilibrium theories of coral reef communities. Climax assemblages were highly diverse and varied in composition from site to site. The ''intermediate disturbance hypothesis'' does not fully predict successional changes in these shallow-water coral assemblages since diversity remained very high at equilibrium (i.e., long after a major disturbance), Competitively inferior species were not eliminated because routine mortality ensured that some space always remained available for colonization.
   We also present a novel method for quantifying the relative importance of each species interaction to community composition and the rate of succession, based on a sensitivity analysis of the transition matrix. The analysis shows that the importance of a species to the dynamics of a community may be unrelated to its abundance at equilibrium, with some rare species groups having a greater impact than more common ones. Sensitivity analysis of this type will provide a powerful means of identifying ''keystone'' species in complex assemblages where experimental manipulation of each species is impossible.

AB The first paleoecological data from the Darien of Panama, a remote region rich in endemic species and purported to be one of the last untouched neotropical wildernesses, demonstrate a 4000-yr history of human disturbance. Unstable climate is recorded as changes in precipitation inferred from the diatom record, but a more important source of disturbance has been human activity. Pollen, and phytoliths of Zea mays, and charcoal from grass fires confirm historical and archaeological judgments that the region has a long history of human settlement. The data are consistent with depopulation and abandonment of most agriculture following the Spanish conquest, showing that the local modern forest has developed in recent centuries. Four millennia of disturbance that preceded the decline of human populations may have had a profound effect upon the modern forest associations. The apparently pristine forests appear to have regrown in just 350 yr, probably from populations fragmented by previous agricultural disturbance. However, the modern richness of the Darien forests suggests that local biodiversity was maintained throughout 4000 yr of indigenous agriculture.

AB Fits of nonlinear difference equations to time series with observation errors were examined by stochastic simulation and analysis of plankton time series from two lakes. Even modest observation errors (e.g., coefficient of variation among replicate samples approximate to 10%) cause errors in model identification and bias in parameter estimates. The latter problem can be corrected by estimation techniques that account for observation error, but model identification is difficult unless the state variables are manipulated. Without manipulation, statistical criteria tend to favor linear models, even when data are simulated by nonlinear processes. Methods that account for observation error produced satisfactory fits to time series of edible algae from two lakes over 7 yr. In Paul Lake, which has not been manipulated, the best fitting model included linear growth, a linear functional response for grazing loss, and an autoregressive moving average model for the errors. In manipulated Tuesday Lake, the best fitting model included linear growth and a nonlinear functional response. Experimental manipulations, or other substantial perturbations, may be essential for detection of nonlinearities in ecological interactions.

AB We examined variations in tree growth responses to climatic variations among different tree species and habitat types in the subalpine zone of the Colorado Front Range. We constructed 25 tree ring site chronologies (11 of Picea engelmannii, 9 of Abies lasiocarpa, 4 of Pinus contorta var. latifolia, and 1 of Pinus flexilis) from a series of subalpine habitats ranging from xeric to wet. To establish tree growth responses to climatic variation, we used correlation and response function analyses to compare variations in ring widths with monthly temperature and precipitation records. At the driest sites, growth of Picea and Abies tracked climatic variation similarly. At mesic and wet sites, however, these species differed in their responses to climatic variation. The responses of Pinus contorta, sampled over a narrower range of habitat types, differed from those of Picea and Abies but did not differ among sites. Steep environmental gradients in the subalpine zone of the Front Range accounted for most of the observed differences in growth responses to climatic variation. Even at adjacent sites that differ only slightly in topographic position, tree growth responses to climatic variation were distinct. Interspecific differences in response to climatic variations generally were less important than site differences. Intersite differences in tree growth responses to climatic variation can be used as indicators of environmental differences among subalpine habitats.

AB I collected data on 27 pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) populations in eastern and central Ontario and conducted a transplant experiment with one of these populations to test growth and competition-related predictions of several life history models. The predictions are that early maturity and high gonadal investment will occur: (1) in large and fast-growing juveniles; (2) in populations with low adult:juvenile growth ratios; (3) in populations with low density; and (4) in the absence of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), a competing congener. Predictions 1 and 4 were fully supported and Prediction 2 was partly supported, but Prediction 3 was not. The earliest maturing juveniles within populations were significantly larger than conspecifics of the same age that did not mature. Females from a lake population that were transplanted into a fishless pond exhibited both significantly faster growth and a significantly higher gonad to body mass ratio (gonadosomatic index) than females living in the lake. At the population level, juvenile growth was significantly correlated with age at maturity (r = -0.53), but not with gonadosomatic index, whereas the Adult: Juvenile Growth Ratio showed a significant, negative correlation with gonadosomatic index (r = -0.66), but not with mean age at maturity. Mean age at maturity showed a stronger correlation with the indicator of life-span and adult survival rate (r = 0.74), suggesting that mortality is more important than growth in the shaping of reproductive life histories of pumpkinseed.
   High population density was associated with early maturity and high gonadal investment, the opposite of what was predicted. However, pumpkinseed populations that co-occurred with bluegills did mature significantly later and at a larger size and tended to have a lower gonadal investment than populations living in waterbodies without bluegills. This difference in reproductive patterns in the presence of bluegill is consistent with two-stage life history theory and may be the result of a direct effect of bluegills on pumpkinseed growth and survivorship, as well as differences in environmental conditions where the two species do or do not co-occur.

AB Density dependence was examined in two species of neotropical treelets, Faramea occidentalis and Desmopsis panamensis, in a 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island in Panama. Survival and growth probability of plants larger than 1 cm dbh (diameter at breast height), and recruitment into the 1-cm class, were assessed as a function of the number of conspecific neighbors in various distance and size classes. Density-dependent effects on survival and growth were strong in Faramea. Performance of 1-8 cm dbh plants declined with increasing numbers of adult neighbors within 1 m, 1-2 m, and 2-4 m, but neighbors at 4-6 m had no effect. Performance also declined with increasing numbers of juvenile neighbors <4 cm dbh, but the effect was less pronounced. Saplings of Faramea grew poorly in areas of high juvenile density within 30 m, independent of the effects caused by neighbors within 4 m. In contrast to Faramea, Desmopsis showed no density dependence in survival nor in growth. For recruitment, however, the two species showed similar patterns: recruit density was lower in regions with an adult conspecific within 1 or 2 m distance, but higher in regions with high densities of adult or juvenile conspecifics between 2 and 30-60 m. Desmopsis must have suffered density-dependent effects at stages < 1 cm dbh, but the effect vanished by the 1 cm dbh stage. In Faramea, strong neighborhood effects were evident in all size classes < 8 cm dbh.

AB We describe a spatially realistic metapopulation model and parameterize it for a metapopulation of the butterfly Melitaea cinxia, residing in a network of 50 discrete habitat patches within an area of 15 km2. Parameter values that are difficult to estimate independently are obtained by fitting the model to patterns of patch occupancy and local density. There is no large ''mainland'' population, and the metapopulation appears to survive at an extinction-colonization equilibrium. Empty patches were smaller than the occupied ones, indicating the extinction proneness of especially small local populations; population turnover was 16% between 2 yr. Density in the occupied patches increased with decreasing isolation and with decreasing patch area, suggesting that migration plays an important role in local dynamics. Mark-recapture results confirmed that migration between local populations was common, in contrast to what is frequently assumed for butterflies with well-defined local populations in discrete habitat patches. The modelling results demonstrate that it is possible to have empty habitat patches in a metapopulation in spite of frequent migration, as we observed for M. cinxia. Colonization rate of empty patches may be low for several reasons, including difficulties in mate location at low density (not likely to be important here), conspecific attraction (possibly important), stepping-stone and other forms of nonrandom migration (likely to be important), and weak density dependence (likely to be important). Our results support the assumptions of structured metapopulation models, which demonstrate the possibility of alternative stable equilibria for metapopulations in which migration significantly affects local dynamics.

AB All organisms, especially terrestrial plants and other sessile species, interact mainly with their neighbors, but neighborhoods can differ in composition because of dispersal and mortality. There is increasingly strong evidence that the spatial structure created by these forces profoundly influences the dynamics, composition, and biodiversity of communities.
   Nonspatial models predict that no more consumer species can coexist at equilibrium than there are limiting resources. In contrast, a similar model that includes neighborhood competition and random dispersal among sites predicts stable coexistence of a potentially unlimited number of species on a single resource. Coexistence occurs because species with sufficiently high dispersal rates persist in sites not occupied by superior competitors. Coexistence requires limiting similarity and two-way or three-way interspecific trade-offs among competitive ability, colonization ability, and longevity.
   This spatial competition hypothesis seems to explain the coexistence of the numerous plant species that compete for a single limiting resource in the grasslands of Cedar Creek Natural History Area. It provides a testable, alternative explanation for other high diversity communities, such as tropical forests. The model can be tested (1) by determining if coexisting species have the requisite trade-offs in colonization, competition, and longevity, (2) by addition of propagules to determine if local species abundances are limited by dispersal, and (3) by comparisons of the effects on biodiversity of high rates of propagule addition for species that differ in competitive ability.

AB Many forest-dwelling small mammals feed on the sporocarps of hypogeous fungi, but the nutritional value to small mammals of these sporocarps is thought to be low. This study investigated the value of hypogeous sporocarps to a mycophagous marsupial, the Tasmanian bettong, Bettongia gaimardi, by monitoring diet composition (via fecal analysis) and energetics in a free-ranging population in relation to variations in sporocarp production. The occurrence of fungus in the diet reflected sporocarp production. When production was high, the animals were almost exclusively mycophagous, while at lower levels of production they added dicot fruit and leaf to the diet. Females were slightly but consistently more mycophagous than males. Body condition in both sexes tended to increase with increased representation of fungus in the diet. Further, rates of energy turnover in females and growth rates of pouch young were positively related to sporocarp production. These observations suggest that hypogeous sporocarps are a primary food resource of high value to this marsupial.

AB Seasonal and spatial patterns of seed dissemination ofthe canopy tree Cornus controversa were studied over two fruiting seasons in a temperate deciduous forest in Japan. Seedfall was monitored every 2 wk in seed traps (N = 221) distributed over a 1-ha study plot that included 12 mature Cornus. Estimated annual seed production was 1.57 x 10(6) seeds/ha. In both years, the peak of fruit ripening had already ended before migratory frugivorous birds entered the area and only 17% ofthe seeds were disseminated by birds. Directly fallen seeds were deposited close to the parent trees (usually within 10 m, infrequently as far as 35 m from parent trees). In contrast, bird-disseminated seeds showed a markedly scattered distribution; the birds deposited more than half of the seeds they ate > 5 m from the crown edge, and density of bird-disseminated seeds exceeded that of directly fallen seeds at distances > 15 m, with some found > 40 m from the nearest mature Cornus. In addition, birds seemed to selectively eat fruits that contained viable seeds. The density of bird-disseminated seed decreased significantly with increasing distance from fruiting trees, both conspecific and heterospecific. Distance to the nearest edge of canopy gaps that were several years old had little effect on the spatial pattern of bird-disseminated seeds. This means that seeds of C. controversa were not directionally dispersed into canopy gaps by birds.

AB Phally, a genital polymorphism found in some species of self-compatible simultaneous hermaphrodites, presents an opportunity to examine environmental and genetic influences on mating system traits. Both aphallics and euphallics can self-fertilize, but aphallics cannot donate sperm because they do not develop a functional penis and prostate. Previous studies of the freshwater gastropod Bulinus truncatus (Mollusca: Pulmonata) suggest that in at least some laboratory populations, phally is determined by temperature during egg and hatchling stages, with colder temperatures favoring the development of euphally. Here we provide evidence for temperature-influenced phally determination in natural populations of B. truncatus in northern Nigeria. The prevalence of euphally across 49 populations ranged from 0 to 81%. Levels of euphally increased significantly both within and across sites as temperatures decreased during the dry-cool season. Across sites, time of year (date) was the strongest single predictor of proportion of euphallics. When the effects of time of year were controlled for, there was a significant negative correlation between temperature during phally development and proportion of euphallics. In addition, maximum water temperature during the Ist wk of the study predicted proportions of euphallics in the next snail generation. A laboratory study of snails from three of these populations demonstrated that temperature sensitivities differed between populations: one population that remained 100% aphallic over the course of held observations showed only low levels of temperature sensitivity in the laboratory, while a population that tripled in proportion of euphallics in the field showed strong levels of temperature sensitivity. Furthermore, individuals within populations varied in their temperature sensitivities. These results are discussed in light of the adaptive significance of labile phally determination.

AB The difficulty of distinguishing allelopathy from resource competition among plants has hindered investigations of the role of phytotoxic allelochemicals in plant communities. The effects of allelopathic substances on competitive outcome when two species differ in their sensitivity to an inhibitor were modelled by applying atrazine, a commonly used herbicide for broadleaf weeds, to corn-soybean mixtures. A target-neighbor design was used, in which differing densities of a neighbor species are planted around one individual of the target species. This design is particularly appropriate to investigations of allelopathy, due to the density-dependent nature of phytotoxic effects. Neighbor density greatly influenced the response to the toxin. At corn densities of 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 plants per pot and atrazine treatment of 3.0 mg/kg, the dry mass of the soybean (target) plant increased from 0.2 g with no neighbors to 0.5 g with 9-12 neighboring corn plants. The increased growth of soybean at higher corn densities is contrary to the predicted effects of resource competition and is due to uptake of atrazine by the corn plants, which decreased the amount available to the soybean target. Detoxification of soil by neighbors may explain in part the conflicting assessments of some putatively allelopathic species, such as black walnut (Juglans nigra).

AB While ecologists involved in management or policy often are advised to learn to deal with uncertainty, there are a number of components of global environmental change of which we are certain-certain that they are going on, and certain that they are human-caused. Some of these are largely ecological changes, and all have important ecological consequences. Three of the well-documented global changes are: increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; alterations in the biogeochemistry of the global nitrogen cycle; and ongoing land use/land cover change. Human activity-now primarily fossil fuel combustion-has increased carbon dioxide concentrations from similar to 280 to 355 mu L/L since 1800; the increase is unique, at least in the past 160 000 yr, and several lines of evidence demonstrate unequivocally that it is human-caused. This increase is likely to have climatic consequences-and certainly it has direct effects on biota in all Earth's terrestrial ecosystems.
   The global nitrogen cycle has been altered by human activity to such an extent that more nitrogen is fixed annually by humanity (primarily for nitrogen fertilizer, also by legume crops and as a byproduct of fossil fuel combustion) than by all natural pathways combined. This added nitrogen alters the chemistry of the atmosphere and of aquatic ecosystems, contributes to eutrophication of the biosphere, and has effects on biological diversity in the most affected areas. Finally, human land use/land cover change has transformed one-third to one-half of Earth's ice-free surface. This in and of itself probably represents the most important component of global change now and will for some decades to come; it has profound effects on biological diversity on land and on ecosystems downwind and downstream of affected areas. Overall, any clear dichotomy between pristine ecosystems and human-altered areas that may have existed in the past has vanished, and ecological research should account for this reality.
   These three and other equally certain components of global environmental change are the primary causes of anticipated changes in climate, and of ongoing losses of biological diversity. They are caused in turn by the extraordinary growth in size and resource use of the human population. On a broad scale, there is little uncertainty about any of these components of change or their causes. However, much of the public believes the causes-even the existence-of global change to be uncertain and contentious topics. By speaking out effectively, we can help to shift the focus of public discussion towards what can and should be done about global environmental change.

AB Nicotine is thought to be an excellent example of a ''mobile'' (sensu Coley et al. 1985) plant defense metabolite: it is synthesized in the roots, transported to leaves, and reported to be metabolically labile, with a half-life of <24 h. In a companion paper (Ohnmeiss and Baldwin 1994), we demonstrated that nondestructive damage dramatically increased the whole-plant allometric accumulation of nicotine in Nicotiana sylvestris (Solanaceae) and that damaged plants accumulated a larger proportion of their total nitrogen in nicotine pools than did undamaged plants. These damage-induced accumulations could arise from either increased nicotine production and/or decreased turnover with unaltered production. Here we ask how much of the change in whole-plant nicotine pools that is induced by damage is a result of increased nicotine production, with nitrogen derived from (NO3)-N-15 that was acquired, reduced, and assimilated after damage. In three experiments, we examine the rates of induced and constitutive nicotine production over 2 d, over 8 d under two nitrate supply rates, and over the lifetime of the plant. By examining N-15-labeled nicotine pool sizes at different times after damage, we estimate the magnitudes of nicotine turnover and its importance in the induced changes in whole-plant nicotine pools.
   Two days after damage, damaged plants had accumulated 4.8 times the nicotine pool of undamaged plants, and 57% of the increase in the nicotine pool of damaged plants was synthesized with N from (NO3)-N-15 acquired after damage. Damage increased the rate of nicotine-N-15 production from 2.0 mu g/h in undamaged plants to 6.3 mu g/h in damaged plants. No evidence for nicotine turnover was found in either damaged or undamaged plants. The 8-d experiment conducted under two different nitrate supply rates confirmed these results. Furthermore, the 8-d experiment documented that N from (NO3)-N-15 acquired after damage was allocated to nicotine production in constant proportions within damaged and undamaged plants, independently of nitrate supply rate; 3.0-3.1 and 5.7-6.1% of the total N-15 pool in undamaged and damaged plants, respectively, was used for nicotine production. Therefore, leaf damage doubles the allocation of recently acquired nitrogen to nicotine production in plants that do not differ in nitrate uptake or growth. In an experiment lasting 41 d after damage, we found that the damage-induced increase in total nicotine pools quantified after 5 d remained unchanged over the lifetime of the plants and that in undamaged plants the nicotine-N-15 pool produced after 5 d was similarly unchanged at 41 d. In damaged plants the nicotine-N-15 pool produced after 5 d decreased by 33.3% after 41 d. This decrease in the nicotine-N-15 pools of damaged plants could be due to either metabolism or volatilization.
   We conclude that nicotine is not the metabolically labile secondary metabolite that it has been previously reported to be and that the changes in pool sizes induced by damage and nitrogen stress are principally due to changes in production and not turnover. Previous studies examined the metabolism of exogenously fed nicotine, rather than the metabolism of endogenously produced nicotine, and this difference in experimental protocol may account for the differences in results. These results demonstrate that the induced patterns of nicotine accumulation are not consistent with the predictions of the carbon/nutrient theory and are consistent with those of the optimal defense theory.

   IMPACTS
AB Some plants can compensate, and even overcompensate, for the loss of productivity caused by herbivory. The presence of latent meristems, or dormant buds, is one of the basic prerequisites of such compensation mechanisms. We present a mathematical model in order to analyze compensation responses in relation to the intensity of herbivory.
   The model generates a number of qualitatively different kinds of compensation curves when seed production is plotted against the proportion of active meristems lost per grazed plant. The shape of the curves depends on the proportion of dormant buds and their activation sensitivity in relation to meristem, loss. Overcompensation is most probable when dormant buds are easily activated. When plants are grazed only once, as assumed in our model, selection favors high bud sensitivity. However, we expect that repeated damage may select for a more restrained pattern of bud activation. When relatively few buds remain dormant, plants can overcompensate for low levels of damage only. On the other hand, when most buds remain dormant, they can overcompensate even for high levels of damage. We consider compensation capacity a potential benefit of bud dormancy when plants are subject to damage. However, bud dormancy may also imply costs on plant productivity and fecundity in the absence of herbivory. Still, intense herbivory may favor bud dormancy in spite of the potential costs. Selection for bud dormancy requires both that the risk of herbivory is high and that herbivores remove a large fraction of active meristems per plant.
   Consequently, overcompensation is a theoretically plausible possibility, and intense herbivory is a potential selective force that favors bud dormancy. None of these results, however, imply that herbivory is beneficial to plants. In our case, plants with bud dormancy never have higher seed production than plants that have no dormant buds and that are not grazed.

AB Foraging behavior provides the mechanistic link between species performance and food resources in the environment. I document the foraging responses of a browsing ruminant, the kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), to changes in food abundance and quality over the seasonal cycle and interpret the results in the context of optimal foraging theory. The study was carried out on hand-reared but free-ranging animals in a savanna region with summer wet season and winter dry season in Transvaal, South Africa. During the dry season, kudus expanded their diet to include evergreen and unpalatable deciduous woody species neglected during the wet season. The acceptability rating of woody plants was correlated with food value expressed in terms of a protein-condensed tannin index, relative to handling time during ingestion or digestion. However, dietary expansion alone was inadequate to satisfy the daily energy requirement during this period. The animals also increased the fraction of trees of palatable species that was accepted for feeding, extended feeding duration at feeding stations, and increased encounter rate with evergreen trees still retaining leaves. Both total time active and proportion of active time spent foraging increased over the dry season. Digestive capacity was apparently increased to accommodate a higher daily food intake, which compensated for reduced diet quality. Only in September at the end of the dry season, when little foliage remained, were compensatory adjustments inadequate to meet energy requirements. The functional response relating consumption rate to seasonal changes in food abundance showed little variation, despite a decline in foliage biomass by more than an order of magnitude. The kudus were neither energy maximizers, nor time minimizers, but rather targeted on their energy requirements with least overall cost. Findings demonstrate that the foraging time and digestive capacity constraints assumed in optimal diet models are somewhat elastic. Dietary predictions obtained using average parameter settings may be misleading, because constraints may become effective only under extreme conditions. Further research is needed to establish the costs associated with stretching physiological constraints towards their upper tolerance limits.

AB Arthropod herbivore communities vary in the proportion of plant family specialists and broad generalists. Examination of the literature of 23 annual crop plant species and the associated feeding relations of 498 arthropod species in Japan revealed that contemporary cropping area was only weakly associated with current arthropod species richness, and that the proportion of plant family specialists was greater and the proportion of generalists was lower on plant species that had been in Japan for longer periods of time. These results suggest that arthropod communities become increasingly more specialized or less generalized the longer a plant coexists with the community, and that this process can occur over time periods of a few thousand years. Exotic arthropod species associated with these plants and known to have invaded Japan in the last 100-200 yr are more generalized than the native fauna, so species invasions could not contribute to the increased specialization or decreased generalization with time.

AB While most studies of plant recruitment focus on competitive interactions, recruitment can be influenced by both positive and negative interactions. We studied recruitment in the marsh elder, Iva frutescens, to examine the relationship between positive and negative forces in recruitment.
   Marsh elder seedling establishment was competitively precluded in undisturbed habitats by the dense perennial turfs that dominate marsh habitats. Adult marsh elders, however, passively trapped tidally transported plant debris that kills underlying vegetation. As a result, adult Iva created bare space and positively influenced seedling recruitment by facilitating the formation of seedling safe sites.
   Within bare patches, Iva seedling survivorship was high under adult conspecifics and at high seedling densities. In contrast, solitary Iva seedlings without adult neighbors suffered extremely high mortality. These positive associations among neighbors were experimentally shown to result from neighbor buffering of hypersaline soil conditions. Salinities in unshaded bare patches were elevated due to increased exposure to radiation and surface evaporation. Both adult nurse plants and high seedling densities shaded the soil, ameliorated high soil salinities, and thus had positive effects on seedling performance. Under adult canopies or when soil salinities were experimentally reduced by shading or watering, positive associations did not occur and all interactions among seedlings or between seedlings and adults were competitive.
   Our results indicate that marsh plant recruitment is dictated by a balance between positive and negative forces. Moreover, since positive interactions were only seen once densities and physical forces had been experimentally manipulated, our results warn that positive interactions may be important forces in assemblages even where they are not conspicuous. These findings contribute to growing evidence that positive interactions, particularly those mediated by neighbor amelioration of harsh physical conditions, are important community level processes in a wide range of plant and animal assemblages.

AB I studied the effects of oak leaf litter, herb competition, and insect herbivory on the establishment of seedlings of Ailanthus altissima in New Jersey, USA. I performed two experiments in an early-successional site in two consecutive years. In the first experiment I tested the effects of litter and competition, and their interaction, on establishment and growth of tree seedlings. In the second experiment I studied the effect of insecticide application in combination with litter and herb competition on seedling establishment and growth, and on arthropod abundance. In the absence of competition, litter had no significant effect on the biomass of woody seedlings, though it delayed seedling emergence. Herb competition reduced the growth of the woody seedlings, but the addition of leaf litter reduced the density and biomass of the herbs, indirectly improving the growth of the woody seedlings. Litter increased both invertebrate damage to seedling cotyledons and seedling mortality. The application of insecticide increased seedling emergence and reduced seedling mortality, and more so in the presence of litter. The total number of arthropods and the number of plant-chewing arthropods were increased by the addition of litter and reduced by application of insecticide. Thus, litter had, simultaneously, a positive indirect effect on individual biomass through reduced competition, and a negative indirect effect on the number of individuals through increased seed and/or seedling predation, and a negative direct effect on seedling mortality.

AB Development of low oxygen conditions (hypoxia) in bottom waters of stratified lakes has a profound effect on the distribution of aquatic organisms. Fish avoid hypoxic waters by moving into oxygenated water and suffer massive die-offs when migration is not possible. However, central mudminnows (Umbridae: Umbra limi) were captured regularly in severely hypoxic bottom waters of a lake in northern Wisconsin, USA. Caging experiments confirmed the lethality of this environment to mudminnows. The presence of freshly ingested phantom midge larvae (Diptera: Chaoborus) in the stomachs of mudminnows during the day coupled with the observation that Chaoborus are restricted to hypoxic waters during the day indicate that mudminnows routinely ventured into a lethal environment to forage. This conclusion was supported by caging experiments whereby mudminnows denied access to hypoxic water during the day did not contain Chaoborus in their stomachs. In laboratory experiments, ingestion of air bubbles enhanced the ability of mudminnows to forage in hypoxic water, but even in the absence of surface access, mudminnows readily foraged in hypoxic waters. These data help explain reports of other fish venturing into hypoxic waters and suggest that foraging in hypoxic waters may be common among some fishes when food abundance is low in surface waters.

AB This article investigates the dynamic behavior of a model of an unstable food chain consisting of three species or trophic levels. The model assumes that each of the consumer species has a Holling type 2 functional response. The study examines how dynamic behaviors and top-level population densities change with the carrying capacity of the bottom level. In all cases examined, the mean population density of the top species initially increases, but eventually decreases as carrying capacity is increased. In some cases, a sufficient increase in the carrying capacity of the bottom species leads to extinction of the top species. If the maximum rate of change of the top species is sufficiently slow relative to the middle species, the period of the population cycles in the top species can change rapidly with a small change in the carrying capacity of the bottom species. Low carrying capacities produce simple cycles with a long period, while high carrying capacities produce simple cycles with a short period. For intermediate carrying capacities, more complex dynamical behaviors, including chaos, may occur. Systems that have only one equilibrium point with all species present may have two alternative attractors with very different densities of the top-level species. The responses of the bottom two species to an increased carrying capacity are also discussed. The results imply that nutrient enrichment may adversely affect high-level consumers and that reductions in the density of top-level consumers may make it difficult or impossible to restore their populations.

AB Intraspecifically, plant seed production is a function of both seed size (mean mass per seed) and plant size. In this paper we examined the interspecific relationship between the size of seeds and plants and the mean long-term annual seed production per tree. For canopy trees, we show that seed production is highly (inversely) correlated with the mean seed mass as a power law argument. Tree size (basal area or leaf mass) is directly proportional to seed production over a limited range. Analysis of seed production for herbaceous plants indicates a relationship similar to that for trees. As the exponent relating seed size to seed production is > -1.0, it follows that large-seeded plants produce more total annual crop mass than do small-seeded species. However, this is balanced by the greater investment in ancillary reproductive tissue by smaller seeded species. The results obtained here ought to be of theoretical and applied interest in, for example, stand-level simulations of population dynamics or for planning the optimal size and shape of clear-cuts intended to be regenerated naturally.

AB Relative nutrient uptake efficiency was measured using a dual-radiotracer (P-32 and P-33) technique for Agropyron desertorum, Artemisia tridentata, and Pseudoroegneria spicata, species from the arid shrub-steppe of the Intermountain Region in the western U.S. These species differed in the timing and magnitude of their response to experimentally enriched soil microsites. The most rapid and significant increase in the uptake of phosphorus tracer from enriched microsites was exhibited by Agropyron, followed by Artemisia, while there was only a trend toward an increase in uptake for Pseudoroegneria. The volume of soil enriched was only 4% of the total pot volume yet Agropyron extracted more phosphorus from the enriched microsite than was removed from the remainder (96%) of the soil volume based on tracer uptake from enriched and unenriched microsites. For Agropyron and Pseudoroegneria, plant uptake of phosphorus from microsites was approximately proportional to the soil microsite enrichment and all three species exhibited increased root length density within the microsites in proportion to the concentration of available nutrients. Integrated physiological and morphological response of the plants to nutrient enrichment increased phosphorus uptake, normalized to the amount of phosphorus available in the soil microsites, by 19.7 to 97.5 x compared to uptake from a similar volume of unenriched soil. Preferential allocation of recently assimilated carbon to roots within enriched soil microsites was also demonstrated. The most important differences detected among species were associated with the temporal flexibility they exhibited in response to enrichment of soil microsites. Differences in flexibility ana response among these species have been reported for other aspects of nutrient uptake, suggestive of species-specific differences contributing to demonstrated differences in productivity, persistence, and competitive ability.

AB We used the eddy-correlation technique to investigate the exchange of CO2 between an undisturbed old-growth forest and the atmosphere at a remote Southern Hemisphere site on 15 d between 1989 and 1990. Our goal was to determine how environmental factors regulate ecosystem CO2 exchange, and to test whether present knowledge of leaf-level processes was sufficient to understand ecosystem-level exchange.
   On clear summer days the maximum rate of net ecosystem CO2 uptake exceeded 15 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), about an order of magnitude greater than the maximum values observed on sunny days in the winter. Mean nighttime respiration rates varied between approximate to-2 and -7 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). Nighttime CO2 efflux rate roughly doubled with a 10 degrees C increase in temperature.
   Daytime variation in net ecosystem CO2 xexchange rate was primarily associated with changes in total photosynthetically active photon flux density (PPFD). Air temperature, saturation deficit, and the diffuse PPFD were of lesser, but still significant, influence. These results are in broad agreement with expectations based on the biochemistry of leaf gas exchange and penetration of radiation through a canopy. However, at night, the short-term exchange of CO2 between the forest and the atmosphere appeared to be regulated principally by atmospheric transport processes. There was a positive linear relationship between nocturnal CO2 exchange rate and downward sensible heat flux density. This new result has implications for the development of models for diurnal ecosystem CO2 exchange.
   The daytime light-use efficiency of the ecosystem (CO2 uptake/incident PPFD) was between 1.6 and 7.1 mmol/mol on clear days in the summer but decreased to 0.8 mmol/ mol after frosts on clear winter days. Ecosystem CO2 uptake was enhanced by diffuse PPFD, a result of potentially global significance given recent increases in Northern Hemisphere haze.

AB Individuals may leave their birthsite before reproducing or they may postpone reproduction because they are at risk of engaging in inbred matings with their close relatives or because they are exposed to severe competition for resources or for mates. I studied whether avoidance of inbreeding and intrasexual competition determine the seasonal changes in the rate of philopatry and the fate of individual Townsend's voles (Microtus townsendii). By marking most nestlings before weaning, I knew which recruits were related to one another and to which adult female. There was a pronounced sexual bias in the tendency to remain close to the birth site: 9% of all juvenile males and 33% of all juvenile females entered the breeding population on their natal grid. Males settled farther from their birth site than females did. The proportion of males and females reproducing on their natal grid changed markedly over the breeding season. More males and females reproduced if they were born at the beginning of the breeding season or when breeding activity was depressed by botfly infestation.
   Seasonal changes in female philopatry were consistent with the hypothesis that females disperse in response to competition for resources with breeding females. Females born at high adult female density were less likely to be recruited than those born at other times. They also dispersed farther at low than at high density, probably in response to habitat saturation.
   Avoidance of extreme inbreeding influenced the dispersal tendency of maturing males. Males were less likely to join the breeding population if their mother or a littermate sister was present in their home range when they matured than if they had no female close relatives in their home range. Males with their mother alive at sexual maturation settled farther than males whose mother had disappeared by that time.
   I conclude that inbreeding avoidance influenced natal philopatry in males and that competition for resources influenced natal philopatry in females.

AB Spatial heterogeneity (SH) is generally defined as the complexity and variability of a system property (e.g., plant biomass, cover) in space. Despite its importance in both theoretical and applied ecology, a formal and rigorous definition of SH is lacking. Such a definition is needed to facilitate quantitative analyses. To this end, we suggest that SH must be defined in terms of its underlying components. For categorical maps, SH is the complexity in five components: (1) number of patch types, (2) proportion of each type, (3) spatial arrangement of patches, (4) patch shape, and (5) contrast between neighboring patches. To illustrate the use of these components to develop a quantitative definition of SH, we used statistical models to produce categorical maps with known underlying SH characteristics. These simulated maps were analyzed in a factorial experiment to examine the effectiveness and sensitivity of four indices (i.e., fractal, contagion, evenness, patchiness) to detect patterns in these underlying components of SH. Our results show that any definition of SH is strongly dependent on the underlying variables and the methods used, that many indices depict different aspects of SH, that significant interactions exist among the five components of SH, and that some indices are strongly correlated. Quantification of spatial heterogeneity is essential to our understanding of the relationships between spatial heterogeneity and landscape functions and processes. However, all techniques to measure SH must be evaluated against systems with known characteristics of SH. Such a system is developed and used in this study.

AB Juvenile snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) were radio-tagged at birth on one food addition grid and one control grid, to determine early juvenile survival, the effects of the food addition on survival, and proximate causes of mortality. Indices of survival were also estimated by live-trapping on these grids and on a replicate pair of grids. The overall 30-d survival rates of radio-tagged leverets were 0.46, 0.15, and 0.43 for the first, second, and third litters of the year, respectively. There were no differences between early juvenile survival on the food addition and control grids in any of the litter groups. The main proximate cause of juvenile mortality was predation by small mammalian predators, the most important being red squirrels and arctic ground squirrels. Seventy percent of early juvenile mortality occurred during the first 5 d after birth. Survival of littermates was not independent; litters tended to all live or die as a unit more often than expected by chance. Fifty-one percent of litters had no known survivors after 14 d of age. Individual survival rates were negatively related to litter size and positively related to body size at birth, and litter size was negatively correlated with body size. These correlations were most closely related to differences in life history traits among litters born at different times of the summer, rather than to trade-offs among traits within litter groups.

AB Amphibians that breed in temporary ponds provide a good opportunity to study the ecological and evolutionary consequences of environmental variability. Ephemeral aquatic habitats provide larval amphibians a transient and highly variable opportunity for growth. In the desert ponds used by Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii), tadpole density varies considerably among ponds and often increases within a pond as it dries. Models of optimal size and timing of metamorphosis predict that, relative to constant high resource environments, metamorphosis should occur at a smaller size in constant low resource environments, and smaller and earlier in declining resource environments, assuming all else is equal. Considerable evidence supports the first prediction, but few studies have examined the effect of decreasing resource availability. I conducted an experiment to examine the effects of increasing density and decreasing food level on metamorphosis in Couch's spadefoot toads. Tadpoles at constant high per capita food metamorphosed at the largest sizes. At low or decreasing per capita food, tadpoles metamorphosed at a uniformly small size, but varied in the time required to reach that size. Tadpoles from both increasing density and decreasing food treatments metamorphosed earlier than tadpoles from constant density, constant food treatments. These results support the idea that tadpoles can respond adaptively to resource variation.

AB Golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis) are small herbivores that hibernate during winter. Previous experiments have demonstrated that a high polyunsaturate diet enhances hibernation by ground squirrels. Polyunsaturated fatty acids cannot be synthesized by mammals, but they are commonly produced by plants. It was therefore predicted that ground squirrels, during the 2 mo prior to hibernation, select diet items of a relatively high polyunsaturate content. This hypothesis was tested in a series of laboratory diet selection experiments involving S. lateralis and semisynthetic diets of different polyunsaturate contents. The stomach contents of free-ranging S. lateralis were also analyzed for polyunsaturate content. As predicted, the squirrels preferred semisynthetic diets of relatively higher polyunsaturate contents. Stomach content analyses suggest that the dietary lipids of free-ranging ground squirrels have high polyunsaturate contents. These results indicate that polyunsaturate content may influence the foraging behavior of ground squirrels.

AB We determined controls on litter decomposition and nutrient release for the widespread native tree Metrosideros polymorpha in 11 sites arrayed on gradients of elevation, precipitation, and substrate age on Hawaiian lava flows. The effects of site characteristics were evaluated using three common substrates (Metrosideros leaf litter from one of the sites, wood dowels, and filter paper) decomposed in each of the sites, and the inherent decomposability of tissue (substrate quality) was evaluated using Metuosideros leaf litter from each of the sites decomposed in a common site.
   Site characteristics were responsible for most of the variation in rates of decomposition in the range of sites and substrates examined. Common substrates decomposed much more rapidly in warm, low elevation sites; apparent e,, values, calculated on the basis of variation in mean annual temperature with elevation on individual lava flows, ranged from 4 to 11. Litter decomposed slowly in the dry sites, but leaf litter produced in the dry sites decomposed more than twice as rapidly as litter from wet sites when both were measured in the same site. The higher substrate quality of litter from dry sites could be due to trade-offs among nutrient-use efficiency, water-use efficiency, and carbon gain by water-limited Metrosideros.
   We used these results to test a revision of the CENTURY soil organic matter model that had been designed to simulate the decomposition of surface litter. Simulations accurately matched the pattern but underestimated the magnitude of among-site differences in the decomposition of common substrates in a range of sites. Analyses of both held and simulation results suggested that the decomposition of Metrosidevos leaf litter could be limited by nitrogen availability.

AB Factors affecting the distribution of the grasses Spartina alterniflora and Distichlis spicata in a mid-Atlantic salt marsh were examined. A series of eight shallow wells, four in patches of each grass type, was used to describe physicochemical conditions known to limit the distribution of both grasses. Tidal amplitude, surface and subsurface salinity, and subsurface oxidation-reduction potential were found to be within range, but suboptimal, for both grasses. Evidence of selective grazing upon S. alterniflora was found through examination of grazing sign within the grass patches, observations of feral horse feeding behavior, and examination of feral horse feces for grass epidermal fragments. An exclosure experiment simulated preferential grazing and showed that S. alternifora responded negatively while D. spicata responded positively to simulated preferential grazing of S. alterniflora. These results point to a competitive relationship between the grasses under suboptimal conditions for dominance of either species. Selective herbivory (analogous to predation) upon S. alterniflora was shown to be a plausible factor impacting the competitive relationship to favor D. spicata. Location along physical gradients, interspecies competition, and herbivory are discussed in relation to salt marsh plant communities.

AB Leaf structure in 17 temperate, broad-leaved tree species on xeric, mesic, and wet-mesic sites in central Pennsylvania (USA) was compared to leaf gas exchange and tissue-water relations data for these species measured during wet (1990) and dry (1991) growing seasons. We tested the hypothesis that ecophysiological responses across contrasting species, sites, and growing-season conditions can be related to specific aspects of leaf structure. Species guard-cell length (GCL), leaf mass per area (LMA), and leaf thickness were positively correlated and increased as sites became drier. Mesic species had lower stomatal density than xeric and wet-mesic species. During the wet year, xeric and mesic species had higher area-based net photosynthesis (A) and leaf conductance (g(wv)) and lower osmotic potentials (Psi(pi)) than wet-mesic species. Unlike the xeric species, mesic and wet-mesic species had decreased A and g(wv) in the dry vs, the wet year. Thus, gas exchange in mesic species resembled that of xeric species in the wet year and that of wet-mesic species in the dry year, which may be due to differences in leaf structure. Maximum A rates and mean g(wv) were positively related to species LMA, whereas wet and dry year mean A and g(wv) increased with increasing leaf thickness and GCL across the study sites. Minimum and mean midday leaf water potential and Psi(pi) at zero turgor decreased with increasing LMA, GCL, and leaf thickness. Stomatal density and ecophysiology were not significantly related across the study sites, but they were related within sites. Intrasite comparisons indicated that, in general, gas exchange parameters increased and tissue water parameters decreased with increases in leaf parameters, trends that were consistent with intersite comparisons. These results suggest that both gas exchange and tissue-water relations during wet and dry years were related to specific aspects of species leaf morphology, and that leaf structure has an important predictive role in evaluating ecophysiological responses to environmental stress at the community and landscape level.

AB Synchronous release of gametes or larvae by marine animals may be controlled by as many as four environmental cycles thereby enabling an array of reproductive timing patterns. Cohesive scenarios that account for the diversity of reproductive patterns are rare and tests of their adaptive significance have been even rarer. By exploiting plasticity in the timing of larval release, we isolated proximate factors regulating reproductive synchrony and provided evidence that predation ultimately may best explain the diversity of hatching patterns by brachyuran crabs. Tides entrain reproductive rhythms by many crabs, and therefore spatial and temporal variation in tides produces intraspecific variation in reproductive patterns. This was demonstrated by determining the timing of larval release of the same or sibling species of intertidal crabs in Pacific semidiurnal and Caribbean mixed semidiurnal tidal regimes on the two coasts of the Republic of Panama. The time of larval release varied during the year in the Caribbean, where entraining physical cycles exhibited complicated changes in phase, but not along the Pacific coast, where the phase relationships among physical cycles varied little year-round. Crabs timed larval release relative to the light-dark, tidal phase, and tidal amplitude cycles, but not the lunar cycle, suggesting that three rhythms determined when larvae were released. For each species we ranked these rhythms by the degree to which larval release kept phase with their entraining physical cycles. The species-specific hierarchies of rhythms we observed match those expected if the time of larval release minimizes predation on females, embryos, and newly hatched larvae. Such hierarchies enable crabs to track phase shifts of cycles in variable tidal environments and may enhance reproductive success across tidal regimes. However, larval release may be timed better in some tidal regimes than others due to differences in the phasing of environmental cycles. In some tidal regimes, larval release cannot be synchronized with all three physical cycles during the year, and hierarchies of rhythms may determine the timing and duration of breeding.

AB An experimental study of competition between kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.) and other sympatric desert rodents using exclosures with ''semipermeable'' fences has been continuously maintained at a site in the northern Chihuahuan Desert since 1977. A new set of experimental manipulations begun in 1988 at the same site repeated this study.
   As reported previously for this community, exclusion of three species of Dipodomys from both original and new experimental plots resulted in greater abundances of five species of small granivorous rodents (Chaetodipus penicillatus, Perognathus flavus, Peromyscus ersmicus, P. maniculatus, Reithrodontomys megalotis) on these plots relative to controls. In contrast, there were no significant treatment effects on the abundances of insectivorous grasshopper mice (Onychomys spp.). The long time lag before the response by small granivores to Dipodomys removal observed in the original experiment was not repeated in the experiment begun in 1988.
   Long-term (10 yr) exclusion of kangaroo rats from experimental plots has resulted in changes in vegetative cover, particularly increased grassiness, on these plots relative to controls. We used the repetition of the Dipodomys exclusion experiment in 1988 to evaluate the importance of this potential indirect effect of kangaroo rats on other rodents in this community. By examining differences in rodent capture numbers on the original and new sets of Dipodomys exclusion plots, we could identify four species (C. penicillatus, Perognathus flavus, Peromyscus eremicus, P. maniculatus) whose responses to kangaroo rat removal reflected direct competition from kangaroo rats, one species (R. megalotis) whose response reflected both direct and indirect (via vegetation changes and habitat selection) effects, and two species (Sigmodon hispidus, S. fulviventer) whose responses reflected only vegetation-mediated effects.
   The continuous presence of competition between small granivores and kangaroo rats over the 13-yr study despite large, species-specific fluctuations in abundances suggests that competition is pervasive within this community.

AB The influence of hydrologic linkage between hyporheic and surface subsystems was investigated in sand-bottomed reaches of a desert stream. Direction of hydrologic exchange was measured as vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG) using mini-piezometers. Maps of VHG indicated upwelling (discharge from the interstitial regions into surface water) at the bases of riffles and heads of runs; downwelling (infiltration of surface water into the hyporheic zone) occurred at the bases of runs. Dissolved NO3-N in surface water was higher over or immediately downstream from upwelling zones. Loss of continued supply from the hyporheic zone and intense assimilatory demand by surface autotrophs generated longitudinal declines in NO3-N and lower nutrient concentrations in downwelling zones. Algal standing crop (as chlorophyll a) was significantly higher in upwelling zones than in areas without positive VHG. Postflood trajectories of chlorophyll a indicated that algae at upwelling zones recovered from disturbance significantly faster than those at downwelling zones. Recovery rate was related to supply of NO3-N from enriched interstitial water in the hyporheic zone. Hydrologic linkage integrates surface and hyporheic subsystems and increases ecosystem stability by enhancing resilience of primary producers following flash flood disturbance.

AB Parasitoid communities show patterns in the distribution and abundance of species that fit predictions of niche partitioning models. These models treat community resources as unit volumes and conceptually treat niche partitioning, or resource division, as breakage of this unit into fractions that correlate with proportional densities of the species controlling that fraction of the resource. Unlike many other communities, parasitoid communities are particularly appropriate for applying these models.
   We examined four types of niche partitioning models employing three types of breakage algorithms. Of these, the overall best-fit model was a unidimensional-niche model using a breakage algorithm in which each subsequent break occurred on the smaller or larger fraction at random. Successful fit of these empirically derived, abundance distributions of parasitoid communities to this theoretically derived, expected distribution supports the hypothesis that these communities are minimally structured by a hierarchical process of random niche partitioning along a single resource axis.

AB We examined the foraging strategies of dorcas gazelles (Gazella dorcas) at different spatial scales. When in sand dunes in the Negev desert of Israel, the gazelles fed on a single plant species, the madonna lily (Pancratium sickenbergeri). In summer, when all live plant material is subterranean, the gazelles dug holes in the sand to remove the stem and bulb. After the winter rains, only the tips of the leaves that had emerged above ground were eaten. We examined search patterns and patch choice on a large scale using both null hypotheses generated by a random walk model and ''rules of thumb'' that may approximate an optimal foraging strategy. At a smaller scale, we examined the selection of parts of individual lilies, again making predictions about ''rules of thumb'' that the gazelles should use. Gazelle search paths deviated considerably from a random walk. Gazelles made shorter move lengths in areas of high plant density. Bouts of concentrated feeding in small areas were interspersed with long moves to new foraging areas, suggesting that these animals were repeatedly sampling their environment. Congruent with optimal foraging predictions, the gazelles selected plants with more and larger leaves than randomly available, and concentrated their foraging activity in areas of highest lily densities. In summer, gazelles altered the depth of digs in response to differences in sand compaction. There was a surprising negative correlation between the size of the plant and the amount eaten. This selection of small plants appears to be due to the increased probability of reaching the bulb, which contains most of the plant's volume. Summer foraging by gazelles had a negative impact on the lilies. There is strong selection on the lilies to grow to a sufficient depth that damage of the bulb by herbivory is minimized. Conversely, the gazelles must select plants with bulbs close to the surface to maximize energy intake and minimize the energy cost of digging.

AB A general tritrophic model of intermediate complexity representing the dynamics of trophic level biomass and numbers is presented. The rudiments of the behavior and physiology of resource acquisition and conversion are incorporated as functional and numerical response models. The tritrophic model is used to examine the effects of trophic position on bottom-up-top-down regulation of populations in theory and in practice. The zero growth isoclines of the interacting populations are used to examine the dynamics of the tritrophic system. The herbivore (M(2)) and predator (M(3)) but not the plant (M(1)) isoclines can be solved explicitly. The plant and herbivore isoclines have two forms that depend on whether the proportion of the trophic level available to its consumer (i.e., its apparency) is greater than or less than its potential per unit biomass population growth rate. Rough estimates of the parameters of these inequalities may be deduced from our knowledge of the search biology of the species and known size to growth rate relationships.
   The model shows clearly that bottom-up regulation sets the upper limit for trophic-level growth and top-down regulation determines the level of realized growth. The model explains the paradoxes of enrichment and of biological control that arise from the standard Lotka-Volterra models, and its qualitative predictions compare well to the general conclusions of intensive studies on biological control of the cassava mealybug on cassava by an exotic parasitoid. However, discrepancies that were found caution against unconsidered extrapolation of theoretical predictions to specific situations. The model qualitatively defines the dynamics required of a successful weed biological control agent, of a stable fresh water algal-arthropod herbivore-vertebrate predator system, and of a marine phytoplankton-krill-whale system. The utility of the model is its generality and its basis in quantifiable biology.

AB We conducted an extensive simulation study to compare the performance of a large group of plotless density estimators (PDEs) to obtain clarification of their relative performance in a diversity of sampling situations. The PDEs studied included well-known ones from the literature plus some extensions and modifications introduced here. The simulations cover 96 combinations of 6 spatial patterns, 4 sample sizes, and 4 population densities. We made comparisons within classes of similar estimators, and we indicate the best-performing PDEs out of the complete set studied.
   Over all spatial patterns, the angle-order estimator with measurements to the third-closest individual in each quadrant had the lowest relative root-mean-squared error (RRMSE), followed by the same estimation method with measurements to the second closest individual in each quadrant. Also performing well were the variable area transect, the ordered distance estimator using the third closest individual, and an extension of the Kendall-Moran estimator that searches for the second nearest neighbor and pools search areas from all sample points. Opinions and recommendations are given as to which PDEs perform well enough and are practical enough to deserve strong consideration for use in the field.

AB The woody C-3 Prosopis glandulosa (honey mesquite) and C-4 perennial grass Schizachyrium scoparium (little bluestem) were grown along a gradient of daytime carbon dioxide concentrations from near 340 to 200 mu mol/mol air in a 38 m long controlled environment chamber. We sought to determine effects of historical and prehistorical increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration on growth, resource use, and competitive interactions of a species representative of C-4-dominated grasslands in the southwestern United States and the invasive legume P. glandulosa. Increasing CO2 concentration stimulated N-2 fixation by individually grown P. glandulosa and elicited in C-3 seedlings a similar relative increase in leaf intercellular CO2 concentration, net assimilation rate, and intrinsic water use efficiency (leaf net assimilation rate/stomatal conductance). Aboveground biomass of P. glandulosa was not altered by CO2 concentration, but belowground biomass and whole-plant water and nitrogen use efficiencies increased linearly with CO2 concentration in seedlings that were grown alone. Biomass produced by P. glandulosa that was grown with S. scoparium was not affected by CO2 concentration. Stomatal conductance declined and leaf assimilation rates of S. scoparium at near maximum incident light increased at higher CO2 concentration, but there was no effect of CO2 concentration on biomass production or whole-plant water use efficiency of the C-4 grass. Rising CO2 concentration, especially the 27% increase since the beginning of the 19th century, may have contributed to more abundant P. glandulosa on C-4 grasslands by stimulating the shrub's growth or reducing the amount of resources that the C-3 required. Much of the potential response of P. glandulosa to CO2 concentration, however, appears to be contingent on the shrub's escaping competition with neighboring grasses.

AB We studied the variation in growth of individual trees in a population of Pinus sylvestris near Zurich in relation to tree age, size, and local competition. This population established naturally when the drainage pattern in a peat bog was altered after the Second World War. An unusual opportunity to study stand development was afforded when the trees were harvested in 1987 as part of a restoration program. All tree stumps were mapped, and growth since establishment was measured as cross-sectional area of wood in 5-yr intervals, using disks from the base of each tree.
   The distribution of cross-sectional area was lognormal over most of the period of growth. Size at the beginning of a time interval was the primary determinant of individual growth during that interval, but age and local competition also had significant effects. Younger, smaller trees were better fitted by an exponential growth model, whereas older, larger trees were better fitted by a Gompertz (sigmoidal) model. Some of the results were very different from previous studies: (1) The spatial distribution of trees was not significantly different from random. (2) Size variability decreased during the course of stand development, even though there was no self-thinning. This was because (3) the density of natural establishment was low, and competition, although clearly detectable, was still relatively weak and symmetric after 45 yr of stand development. Thus, there was no ''initial advantage'' in competition, and the younger trees, which were still growing exponentially, were able to catch up with the older trees, whose relative growth rates were declining.

AB To determine the effects of lizards and web spiders on species in lower trophic levels, we manipulated their abundances within large field enclosures on Staniel Cay, Bahamas, from May 1989 to March 1992. The experimental design (2 x 2 factorial) measured the separate effects of lizards and spiders and compensatory predation(lizard x spider interaction). In treatments where web spiders were unaltered, mean number of web spider individuals was 1.4 times higher in enclosures with lizards removed than in those with lizards present at natural densities. Total biomass of aerial arthropods caught in sticky traps was 1.4 times higher in treatments with web spiders removed than in treatments with web spiders unaltered. Lizards had no significant effect on aerial arthropods. Total amount of herbivore damage on sea grape leaves was 3.3 times higher in treatments with lizards removed than in treatments with lizards unaltered. Web spiders had no significant effect on leaf damage. The lizard x spider interaction was not significant in each analysis, indicating that compensatory predation was weak. Our results support a model in which the interaction between top predators (lizards) and herbivores is strong, whereas the interaction between intermediate predators (web spiders) and herbivores is weak. Consequently, the net effect of top predators on producers is positive.

AB In surveys and experiments in a Michigan stream I found that large crayfish (Orconectes propinquus) can indirectly facilitate epilithic diatoms and sessile, grazing insects by virtually excluding a filamentous alga (Cladophora glomerata) from deep water habitats. In shallow(<20 cm) habitats, Cladophora cover and ash-free dry biomass usually exceeded 75% and 50 g/m(2), respectively. In deep habitats (20-50 cm), Cladophora cover rarely exceeded 10% and ash-free dry biomass was usually <3 g/m(2). Mean densities of large crayfish in deep water (3-11 individuals/m(2)) were 3-20 x greater than their densities in shallow water. Two field experiments were conducted to determine if large crayfish were responsible for the reduced abundance of Cladophora in deep water. In the first experiment, depth and current velocity were held constant for all substrata, and crayfish were excluded from half of the substrata. As physical factors such as current velocity and light may vary with water depth, a second experiment was conducted that compared the effect of substrata depth vs, crayfish grazing on Cladophora abundance. In both experiments, Cladophora biomass was at least 10 x greater on substrata which were not grazed by large crayfish. In the second experiment, substratum depth did not have a significant effect on Cladophora abundance. The results of both experiments demonstrated that grazing by large crayfish was the primary mechanism generating the pattern of Cladophora distribution observed in Augusta Creek. The virtual exclusion of Cladophora from deep water habitats by large crayfish can indirectly facilitate epilithic diatoms and sessile, grazing insects that consume these diatoms. Diatoms and sessile, insect grazers were found to be less abundant beneath Cladophora mats in field experiments. Total diatom abundance on substrata without a Cladophora canopy was 20 x that of substrata with a Cladophora canopy. Two sessile, grazing insects (Psychomyia flavida and Leucotrichia pictipes) were 2-3 x more abundant on substrata which did not have heavy Cladophora cover. These results suggest that crayfish are a keystone consumer in this stream community, but the effect is habitat specific and related to crayfish body size.

AB Seagrasses rely on both vegetative (rhizome elongation) and sexual (seeds) propagation for maintenance of existing beds and colonization of new areas. Yet mechanisms of seed dispersal and survival of seeds in new areas remain poorly described. We conducted seed dispersal experiments in the field and laboratory to better describe seed dispersal characteristics in one species, Zostera marina L. (eelgrass), the dominant seagrass species in the temperate zone of the United States, Japan, and Europe.
   Seeds were broadcast by hand into unvegetated 5 m diameter plots at three locations over 3 yr (1989-1991) in the York River, Virginia (Chesapeake Bay), These sites had been previously vegetated but were devoid of any vegetation prior to (since 1972) and during the course of the experiments. Resultant seedling distributions closely matched broadcast patterns, with 80% of all seedlings found within the 5 m diameter plots, despite the fact that geophysical processes would appear sufficient to transport seeds greater distances. Wind records for the 2-mo period between seed broadcasting and germination revealed time-averaged wind speeds in excess of 40 km/h on greater than or equal to 12 d in each of the 3 yr and gale-force winds (72 km/h) in 2 of 3 yr. A three-dimensional hydrographic computer simulation model of the York River provided instantaneous current velocity estimates from which maximum bottom shear velocities (u*) in the study area were approximated (flood tide: 1.26 cm/s, ebb tide: 1.20 cm/s). These estimates exceeded the critical erosion threshold (u*(crit) = 0.7 cm/s) for Z. marina seeds determined from laboratory flume experiments. We postulate that small-scale topographic features on the bottom (burrows, pits, mounds, ripples) shield the seeds from the flow.
   Our results suggest that seeds settle rapidly, dispersing only up to a few metres under the influence of currents and become rapidly incorporated into the sediment. The limited dispersal capabilities of seeds underscore the need to address restoration goals and questions of seagrass ecology in the context of landscape-scale distributional patterns and metapopulation analyses.

AB Many trees of tropical dry forests flower or form new shoots soon after leaf shedding during the dry season, i.e., during a period when trees are likely to be severely water stressed. To resolve this apparent paradox, phenology and seasonal changes in tree water status were monitored during two consecutive dry seasons in > 150 trees of 37 species growing at different sites in the tropical dry lowland forest of Guanacaste, Costa Rica.
   Tree development during the dry season varied considerably between species and between sites of different moisture availability. Leaf shedding, flowering, and shoot growth (flushing) were strongly correlated with seasonal changes in tree water status, measured by conventional and newly developed techniques. Tree water status varied with the availability of subsoil water and a variety of biotic factors such as structure and life-span of leaves, time of leaf shedding, wood density and capacity for stem water storage, and depth and density of root systems. Observed tree species differed widely in wood density (from 0.19 to 1.1 g/cm(3)) and stem water storage capacity (400-20% of dry mass), which was highly correlated with the degree of desiccation during drought. Only hardwood trees at dry upland sites, lacking stem water storage and access to subsoil water, desiccated strongly (stem water potential < -4 MPa) and remained inactive throughout the dry season. In all other trees elimination of transpirational water loss during leaf shedding in conjunction with utilization of residual water enabled rehydration of stem tissues and subsequent flowering or flushing during the dry season. Rate and degree of rehydration varied strongly with the availability of water stored in tree trunks or in the subsoil. Stored water buffers the impact of seasonal drought and enables flowering and flushing during the dry season. Climatic data are thus not sufficient to explain tree phenology in seasonally dry tropical forests.
   Phenology, seasonal changes in water status, and water storage capacity of tree species are highly correlated. Tree species cluster into a number of distinct functional types ranging from deciduous hardwood trees and water-storing lightwood trees in dry upland forests to evergreen light- and softwood trees confined to moist lowland sites. Seasonal variation in tree water status thus appears to be the principal determinant of both phenology and distribution of tree species in tropical dry forests.

AB The widely advocated statement that ecotone movement may be useful in studies of the impacts of global warming implies not only that ecotones exist but that they can be delineated spatially. With sampled field data, the accuracy of the detected ecotone is related to the data type and its spatiotemporal resolution. In the present study, I introduce two edge detection algorithms for regularly (lattice-wombling) and irregularly (triangulation-wombling) two-dimensional sampled data. I investigate the reliability of these algorithms in detecting potential ecotones using simulated vegetation data that follow the individualistic, continuum-gradient, and community-type patterns. Ecotones were defined quantitatively as long narrow regions of high rates of change. Under this definition, significant ecotones were found mostly in the community-type patterns using either of the edge detection algorithms (lattice-wombling or triangulation-wombling) and a systematic or random sampling design, respectively.

AB Foodchain models predict strong positive response of algal biomass to total phosphorus (TP) in odd-link ecosystems where grazers are controlled by planktivores and no significant response of algal biomass in even-link ecosystems where grazers are released from planktivore predation. On the other hand, resource- or ratio-dependent models predict proportional increase in algal biomass with increasing TP. These predictions were tested with field data from a large number of north temperate lake ecosystems exhibiting a wide range of TP. Instead of using the traditional approach of the number of trophic links present in an ecosystem, I used the presence vs. absence or near absence of large Daphnia and planktivorous fish to indicate the functional dominance of odd vs. even links. Results showed that algal biomass response to TP is stronger in dominant odd-link ecosystems than in dominant even-link ecosystems, which is consistent with the predictions of foodchain models. The significant positive slope of the relationship of algal biomass to total phosphorus for dominant even-link ecosystems is not consistent with foodchain models. In addition, a nonlinear response pattern of algal biomass to total phosphorus appears to be inconsistent with both foodchain and ratio-dependent models. Results also showed that even-link ecosystems produce proportionately lower algal biomass, demonstrating that grazers can modify ratio dependence of algal biomass. Overall, algal biomass appears to be both predator and ratio dependent because grazers are capable of modifying algal response to nutrients, and algae show positive response to nutrients even in the presence of large grazers.

AB Vegetation texture (i.e., plant density, species diversity, and structural complexity) may influence the abundance of a herbivore by affecting its movement, altering the suitability of host plants, and by changing the herbivore's vulnerability to attack by natural enemies. We investigated these effects on the Mexican bean beetle (Epilachna varivestis) on snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) growing in high and low-density monocultures and intercropped with short (0.5 m) or tall (1.2 m) com plants (Zea mays). Beetle populations consistently reached higher densities on beans in monocultures than on beans intercropped with tall com. Neither bean plant density nor plant species diversity alone significantly affected beetle abundance. Instead, the presence of tall com plants contributed most to lower bean beetle density in the tall corn-bean intercrop, primarily by reducing adult colonization. However, the tall com also increased the suitability of intercropped bean plants to the beetles because adults preferred to feed on and larvae developed faster on beans in the tall com-bean habitat. Host plant effects were independent of the influence of microclimate and risk of predation.
   Abundance of natural enemies of the bean beetle was low, and overall, predator density and bean beetle larval survival did not differ significantly among habitats. However, it is difficult to predict the effect of mortality factors, such as natural enemies, on bean beetle populations because larval mortality over time was affected by habitat type (i.e., there was a significant interaction between habitat type and time).
   Our results were partially consistent with the resource concentration hypothesis. Whereas Mexican bean beetles colonized bean monocultures more readily than they did tall corn-bean diculture, the presence of more suitable host plants in the diculture acted to increase, rather than decrease, bean beetle density in the tall com-bean habitat. However, higher adult feeding preference and faster larval development on beans in the tall corn-bean habitat did not offset lower adult colonization in this habitat.

AB We studied the pollination ecology and assemblage structure of 31 species of Stylidium (Stylidiaceae) at 25 sites in Western Australia. The number of species per study site varied between two and six. Stylidium species are pollinated by a variety of nectar-seeking solitary bees and bombyliid flies. Within and among species there is significant variation in nectar-tube length (and therefore in the insects that visit the flowers) and in pollen placement on pollinators. Pollen is placed ''explosively'' on the insect by a motile column of fused staminate and pistillate tissues; the position and reach of the column varies within and among species, thereby causing variation in site of pollen deposition. When discrete pollination niches were defined for all species, only one niche overlap was observed across the 86 interacting pairs of Stylidium species at the 25 sites. To determine whether this was a nonrandom assemblage structure we compared our observation with the outcome of null models. We developed three null models to cover the most likely structuring processes: that communities are organized by (1) ecological sorting, (2) evolution of plant phenotypes, or (3) both processes. We concluded that it was unlikely (P = .055-.002) that so few overlaps in pollination niches would occur by chance. We developed another null model to test whether chance could have created the apparent pattern of character displacement in pollination niches exhibited by the nine species showing intraspecific variation. The analysis indicated that character displacement has probably occurred (P = .014). This study is one of the dearest demonstrations to date of reproductive interactions generating assemblage structure and character displacement in plants.

AB The foraging ecology of free-living King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) was studied during October and November 1991 on Possession Island (46 degrees 25' S, 51 degrees 45' E), Crozet Archipelago. Feeding was detected with stomach temperature sensors, which logged feeding activity as indicated by temperature drops. The penguins fed mainly on myctophid fish. Stomach temperature of 16 birds at sea was recorded for a total of 146 d. During 125 d a total of 16 472 food ingestion events was recorded, a mean of 132 events per day. Here, calculated food intake averaged 2320 g/d (range 11-12 889 g) with >80% (range 71-95%) of prey caught during daylight. During the remaining 21 d stomach temperature dropped below the detection limit of 20 degrees C, which made determination of the number of ingestion events impossible and mass ingested determination inaccurate. We propose that there is selection pressure for King Penguins to ingest and digest large quantities of food quickly because these birds alternate fasting periods on land, during which time they care for their chicks, with foraging trips, during which time they must feed on patchily distributed prey.

AB We characterized the structure of 25 old-growth hemlock-hardwood forests in northern Wisconsin and adjacent Michigan in order to examine our working hypotheses that differences in their structure are related to stand age (i.e., stage of development) and that changes in stand structure continue after old-growth status is achieved. Estimates of stand age, i.e., age of oldest tree cored, based on 10 cores taken from hemlocks of a range of diameters in each stand, ranged from 177 to 374. By investigating the patterns of live tree structure, coarse woody debris (CWD), tip-up mounds, and canopy gaps in relation to stand age, we were able to infer changes that occur during stand development.
   Along the gradient of old-growth stand development, some changes in structural features, including total volume of CWD, snag (standing dead tree) basal area, and total area and average size of canopy gaps were continuous, linear increases over time. In contrast, changes in live tree and snag density, density of large trees, volume of well-decayed hemlock logs, and diameter-age relationships occurred after a threshold stand age of 275-300 yr was reached. Area and density of tip-up mounds and density of large seedlings and saplings were not correlated with stand age.
   Old-growth hemlock-hardwood stands at the upper end of the age continuum (> 275-300 yr) have accumulated both gradual and threshold structural changes, acquiring most of the following characteristics: (1) a strong correlation between age and diameter of trees, (2) low densities of live trees distributed across all size classes, (3) trees >70 cm dbh (diameter at breast height), (4) dead wood >120-150 m(3)/ha, with logs >80 m(3)/ha, (5) hemlock logs present in all decay classes, and (6) canopy gaps occupying >10% of the stand, with the average gap size > 50 m(2), some gaps > 200 m(2), and no more than 30% of the gaps <10 m(2). The two oldest stands may be at or near equilibrium, where maximum volumes of CWD are maintained through a balance of tree growth and mortality, and wood decay; and oldest tree age approaches 400+ yr, the maximum longevity typical for hemlock.

AB The influence of biotic and abiotic factors on seed fates are exceptionally difficult to analyze in natural populations because it is not usually possible to identify an emerging seedling with its history as a seed. Large seed size and the unusual feature that the seed body remains attached to the new seedling in the ant-dispersed herb Calathea ovandensis provided an opportunity for field experiments that examine the influence of(l) seed dispersers, (2) treefall gaps, and (3) post-dispersal predators on seed survival, seed dormancy, seedling emergence, and seedling distributions. In a seed depot experiment, seed-dispersing ants significantly affected the seedling emergence patterns in three ways. Seeds with rewards for ants: (a) had improved seedling emergence, by 1.6-fold (17.4 vs. 10.6%); (b) gave rise to seedlings with a mean dispersal distance that was threefold farther (34 vs. 114 cm); and (c) generated a non-leptokurtic seedling shadow(kurtosis: -0.60, not significant vs. 10.84, P < 0.001) in contrast to seeds without ant rewards. There was significant spatial variation in the effect of ant rewards on seedling emergence and also temporal variation in seedling emergence, the greatest number of seedlings emerging in an el Nino year. In two germination box experiments: (1) treefall gaps enhanced seedling emergence 180-fold (72.4 vs. 0.4%) compared to the deep shade, and ungerminated seeds in the deep shade were mostly dormant, not dead; (2) post-dispersal seed predation was very low (overall mean of 6.2%), with considerable microspatial variability, and pathogens and small invertebrates accounted for only one-fourth as much seed mortality as larger (vertebrate and large insect) post-dispersal predators. Seedling emergence in this ant-dispersed herb with a relatively long-lived seed bank depends upon a complex of factors, suggesting an interaction of the effects of biotic dispersal to local safe microsites with larger scale effects of spatial and temporal variation in the abiotic environment.

AB The relative importance of interspecific interference and facilitation in natural plant communities is controversial, in part due to the difficulty of manipulating these interactions in the field. I investigated the relative intensity of facilitative and interfering effects of Arthrocnemum subterminale, a subshrub common in the upper zones of California salt marshes, on three species of winter annuals by measuring spatial associations, manipulating Arthrocnemum canopy cover and root distributions, and comparing aspects of the physical microhabitat under Arthrocnemum to that in the open. The annuals Hutchinsia procumbens and Parapholis incurva were positively associated with Arthrocnemum, and survival and aboveground biomass of these species declined when shrub canopies were removed. Spergularia marina was negatively associated with Arthrocnemum, and survival increased when shrub canopies were removed. Combined effects of facilitation and interference were observed for Parapholis survival and biomass, which were reduced by root interference even though the overall effect of Arthrocnemum on Parapholis was positive.
   Arthrocnemum canopies elicited direct effects on the winter annuals, but also altered substrate characteristics. Soil was mounded under the shrubs, averaging 3.14 cm higher in elevation than the surrounding open soil. Soil salinity was 27% lower under Arthrocnemum canopies, soil moisture was 13% higher under shrubs, and shrub understories received less light than open marsh soil.
   Although Arthrocnemum had species-specific interfering and facilitative effects, and interference and facilitation operated simultaneously, my results suggest that facilitative effects of Arthrocnemum were more significant than interference in the transition zone of the upper marsh. Physical conditions in the open reduced overall annual biomass and survival, but were ameliorated by Arthrocnemum, which altered the species composition and productivity of the upper marsh plant community.

AB Since the 1930s the common house gecko, Hemidactylus frenatus, a sexual species, has been inadvertently introduced to many tropical Pacific islands. Using mark-recapture censuses and visual gecko searches we found that Lepidodactylus lugubris, an asexual gecko previously common on these islands, is nearly 800% more abundant on buildings in the urban/suburban environment on islands that lack H. frenatus than it is on islands where H. frenatus is present. On buildings in Hawaii and Fiji that have been surveyed in different years, the proportion of H. frenatus relative to L. lugubris has significantly increased over time. The degree of numerical dominance is also related to climate and habitat: L. lugubris is relatively more common on the more mesic, cooler, windward sides of large islands compared to the more arid sides of islands and in general H. frenatus does not penetrate forest habitats, where L. lugubris remains one of the most common geckos. Overall, buildings with external electric lights have more geckos than unlit buildings. Where the two species occur on the same buildings H. frenatus is closer, on average, to the prime feeding sites near lights that attract insects. In the absence of H. frenatus, L. lugubris is found closer to the lights. We hypothesize that the previously demonstrated agonistic dominance of H. frenatus over L. lugubris (Bolger and Case 1992) is likely to lead to competitive superiority when insect prey are concentrated into patches that are structurally simple (like flat building walls with lights), allowing easy detection of prey and intruders.

AB We used data on grassland plant community composition over a 90-yr period in the history of the Park Grass Experiment, England to look for relationships between variation in composition and annual variation in rainfall and biomass. This was investigated by regressions of biomass and rainfall on each other, and of these variables separately on each of three different measures of variation in plant community composition, Two of these measures, principal components analysis scores based on variation in species abundance and the ratio by mass of nongrass/grass species, showed significant relationships with biomass variation on many experimental plots, although relationships with rainfall were relatively slight or nonexistent. The third measure employed similarity indices to detect changes in species composition in response to variation in biomass, but failed to find any. Biomass was significantly increased by rainfall on all plots. We propose that variation in community composition was more closely related to biomass variation than to rainfall because rainfall selectively favored the grasses in the community, which we believe competed asymmetrically (for light) with the other species when rainfall was high. The severity of this competition would depend upon biomass more directly than upon rainfall, although it is rainfall that enhanced grass growth. In effect, asymmetric competition magnified the effect of rainfall on community composition.

AB Breakdown of seven leaf species covering a broad range of litter qualities (lignin: 7-31% of leaf dry mass; tannin: 0.0-6.7%; nitrogen: 0.5-2.6%; phosphorus: 0.017-0.094%) and dynamics of fungal biomass and reproductive activity were studied in a softwater mountain stream. Litter breakdown proceeded at exponential rates k ranging from 0.0042 d(-1) (evergreen oak) to 0.0515 d(-1) lash). Fungal colonization of litter was generally rapid, with the fungus-specific indicator molecule ergosterol increasing from initially negligible concentrations to 375-859 mu g/g of detrital mass. Using species-specific factors relating ergosterol concentrations to mycelial dry mass, maximum fungal biomass associated with litter was estimated as 61-155 mg/g of total system mass. Minimum estimates of net mycelial production during active growth varied between 0.3 and 3.8 mg.g(-1).d(-1), and maximum sporulation rates of aquatic hyphomycetes ranged from 760 to 7500 conidia mg(-1).d(-1). Initially, reproductive activity was largely synchronized with increases in ergosterol concentrations, but it declined dramatically after peak sporulation rates were reached, whereas ergosterol concentrations levelled off or decreased at considerably slower rates. Periods of highest fungal productivity were thus limited to an initial breakdown stage of approximate to 2-8 wk. Strong correlations were found between the exponential breakdown coefficient and each of three parameters reflecting fungal activity in leaf litter, that is, maximum ergosterol concentration (P = 0.002, r = 0.96), net mycelial production (P = 0.02, r = 0.92), and sporulation rate (P < 0.001, r = 0.99). The initial lignin content of leaves was also significantly correlated with the rate constant k (P = 0.02, r = -0.83), suggesting that lignin was the primary factor determining litter quality and thus breakdown rate. The correlation was even stronger when data were logarithmically transformed (P < 0.01, r = -0.95). Tannin concentration was significantly correlated with k only when two high-lignin species were excluded from the analysis (P = 0.19, r = -0.56 compared with P = 0.05, r = -0.88), while initial concentrations of phosphorus (P = 0.17, r = 0.58) and particularly nitrogen (P = 0.82, r = 0.06) were poor predictors of litter decomposability. These results suggest that the initial lignin content of leaves controlled litter breakdown rate through a kinetic limitation of carbon sources for saprotrophic microfungi. The decomposer activity of these organisms, in turn, would then have governed breakdown rates. In doing this, fungi produced substantial amounts of both mycelial and conidial biomass that was potentially available to higher trophic levels of the food web.

AB We determined the direct and indirect top-down forces in a tritrophic system composed of a guild of three parasitoid species (Necremnus tidius, N. folia, and Aprostocestus sp.), a single weevil seed-predator species (Ceutorhynchus sp. nov.), and the host plant, Holmathophylla spinosa, a woody crucifer of the high-mountain elevations of the Sierra Nevada (southeast Spain). By means of observational and experimental approaches, we focused on the possible regulatory effects of parasitoids on the weevil population as well as on the analysis of the sign and strength of the resulting indirect effects on plant fitness.
   Weevils attacked 21.7% of the fruit produced by H. spinosa during the study, selecting fruits having the most seeds. Seeds eaten by weevils were significantly bigger than uneaten ones. The number of seeds per fruit after being depredated by Ceutorhynchus was significantly smaller than for fruit not attacked. Thus, weevils affect the fitness of the host plant both by decreasing the number of seeds (quantitative effect) and by reducing the average size of surviving seeds per fruit (qualitative effect). When parasitoids were excluded experimentally, the percentage of attacked fruit (which corresponds to the number of weevil larvae) rose from 20 to 43%. We assume that the increase in the experimental weevil population may be because excluding parasitoids eliminates not only death by parasitoid oviposition for some Ceutorhynchus larvae, but also death by direct predation of parasitoids on weevil larvae. We have also experimentally verified that parasitoid activity benefits the entire plant, by way of parasitoids contributing to a higher average number of seeds dispersed per fruit in each plant, by influencing both the abundance of the weevils and the behavior of the weevil larvae.

AB Pseudoflowers induced by the rust fungus Puccinia monoica on Arabis spp. are flower-like in color, shape, size, nectar production, and scent. Pseudoflowers attract insects that aid the rust's reproduction in a way that is analogous to pollination in flowering plants. I explored the effects of pathogen-induced pseudoflowers and co-blooming buttercups (Ranunculus inamoenus) on each other's insect visitation by comparing visitation in single-species plots and mixtures. Visitation to pseudoflowers was greater in mixtures containing buttercups than in pseudoflower plots of the same density, and visitation to buttercups was also greater in the mixtures than in pure buttercup plots. Because fungal pseudoflowers and buttercups both appeared to receive greater visitation when associated with each other than when alone, and both species produce food for insect visitors, this interaction could be described as Mullerian floral mimicry. However, several characteristics of this system do not fit standard definitions of mimicry: (1) pseudoflowers are not necessarily mimicking any particular species but instead may be generalized flower-mimics, (2) flower visitors may not always mistake pseudoflowers for flowers but may actually choose them, and (3) under some circumstances pseudoflowers and flowers may compete for visitors. Competition in favor of pseudoflowers is most likely when flies are the primary flower visitors or on the rare occasions when pseudoflowers are common relative to other species.

AB Movement and settlement patterns of animal offspring, along with the costs of occupying familiar and unfamiliar habitats, have been inferred frequently, but rarely have they been documented directly. To obtain such information, we monitored the individual fates of 205 (94%) of the 219 offspring born over 3 yr in a population of the North American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), at Fort Assiniboine, Alberta, Canada (54.20 degrees N, 114.45 degrees W). We located neonates by radio-tracking mother squirrels, and thereafter we documented the movements, survival, and settlement patterns of the offspring, using a combination of telemetry, live-trapping, and visual observations. Prior to settlement, offspring made forays of up to 900 m ((X) over bar = 126 m) off the natal territory, but they did not abandon the natal territory until they had settled on their own territory. Foray distance was not related to the age or size of the offspring. We used the locations of offspring kills to show that the risk of predation significantly increased when the offspring were travelling off of their natal territories. Just under half of the 73 offspring that acquired territories did so on or immediately adjacent to their mother's; the farthest settlement distance was only 323 m from the natal territory, or about the distance of three territory widths. Movement data from adults in the population showed that all offspring settled within potential contact of their mother (and possibly their father). Offspring that settled relatively farther away from their natal territory were more likely to obtain larger territories, with traditional hoarding and overwintering sites (middens). These offspring also had higher overwinter survival, suggesting that the costs of making forays off the natal territory may be balanced by the advantages of locating a superior territory.

AB Although xanthotoxin, a linear furanocoumarin, is toxic to a wide variety of lepidopterans, the parsnip webworm, Depressaria pastinacella (Lepidoptera: Oecophoridae), is restricted to feeding on only two genera of Apiaceae, both of which contain large quantities of this toxin. The cost of cytochrome P45O-mediated detoxification of xanthotoxin by this oligophagous species was examined in two artificial diet experiments, In the first experiment, growth rates, silkspinning rates, and detoxification capacity of larvae were measured after they had consumed diets ranging in protein content from 0 to 100% of the amount required for maximum growth. As protein became progressively more limited, growth rates declined progressively while silkspinning rates and detoxification capacity remained unchanged; only when dietary protein was completely absent did silkspinning rates and xanthotoxin metabolism rates decline. These findings suggest that xanthotoxin detoxification capacity is maintained at the expense of growth. In the second experiment, growth rates, silkspinning rates, and xanthotoxin metabolism were measured in larvae that consumed diets with or without xanthotoxin in the presence or absence of protein. As in the previous experiment, the absence of protein led to significant reductions in growth, silkspinning, and detoxification. The presence of xanthotoxin in the diet resulted in an increase in the rates of xanthotoxin metabolism and silkspinning but did not have any effect on growth rates. Inasmuch as there were no interactions between protein and xanthotoxin treatments, induction of xanthotoxin metabolism by xanthotoxin was not affected by protein limitation. The fact that xanthotoxin metabolism is induced almost threefold in the absence of dietary protein, conditions that result in reduction of growth rates by almost 80%, is also consistent with the greater importance of detoxification capacity relative to growth over the short term. Due to its highly oligophagous habits, the parsnip webworm is unlikely to encounter host plant tissue entirely lacking furanocoumarins; circumstances under which the inability to respond to the presence of xanthotoxin in the diet by increasing rates of its metabolism may never exist. Thus, maintaining high and inducible levels of cytochrome P450-mediated xanthotoxin metabolism may be regarded as one of the costs associated with the highly specialized diet of D. pastinacella.

AB I examined growth and survival of the European toad, Bufo bufo, from hatching to the approximate time of first hibernation. I varied tadpole density in experimental ponds such that individuals from low-density ponds emerged 48.5% larger than those from high-density ponds. In the laboratory, metamorphs from both pond densities were maintained in containers at densities of one or six. Nine weeks after metamorphosis they were exposed to 0 or 80 larvae of the lungworm, Rhabdias bufonis. A factorial experiment aimed to determine (1) the extent to which conditions experienced by larvae carried over to the terrestrial stage and (2) the effects of resource limitation and past history on a host's response to a potential pathogen.
   The density of metamorphs had the strongest effect on growth and survival: 18 wk after metamorphosis, those raised alone were approximate to 80% heavier than those in groups and they had 31% higher survival. However, larval history also affected growth and survival and affected how metamorphs responded to density. First, single toads emerging from low-density ponds were 14.5% larger at the time of hibernation than those from high-density ponds. The mechanism for this growth advantage probably lies in the consistently higher growth rates of single toads from low-density ponds, especially during the first 3 wk after metamorphosis. Second, survival in group containers was higher for toads from low-density ponds, especially during the first few weeks after metamorphosis when most deaths involved toads from high-density ponds. These results support a carry-over effect between larval history and subsequent performance in an organism with a complex life cycle.
   Infection with lungworms had no detectable effect on metamorph growth or survival. This result contrasts earlier studies on this system, possibly due to the relatively low worm burdens or low statistical power. Yet, the results may also indicate that the predicted impact of infection on hosts, especially those limited by resources, is not as straightforward as theoretical studies suggest.

AB Many tropical seaweeds and benthic invertebrates produce both secondary metabolites and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) particles or spicules that serve as possible defenses against consumers. To evaluate the relative defensive value of CaCO3, secondary metabolites, and the potential synergistic or additive effects of the two, we made artificial agar-based ''seaweeds'' in which we manipulated algal organic content, CaCO3, and the secondary metabolites produced by the calcified green seaweeds Rhipocephalus phoenix, Udotea cyathiformis, and Halimeda goreauii, all of which are relatively resistant to herbivores. The effects of these manipulations on herbivore feeding were evaluated using three different types of herbivores, the sea urchin Diadema antillarum, the amphipod Cymadusa filosa, and a mixed-species group of small parrotfishes. Addition of finely powdered CaCO3 as 69% of food dry mass had no effect on feeding by parrotfishes, deterred feeding by Cymadusa, and deterred Diadema when food organic content was low but not when it was higher. Although calcification of algal tissues has generally been considered a structural defense that hardens seaweed thalli and makes them more resistant to attack, the decreased feeding on CaCO3-containing foods in our assays occurred without any measurable alteration of food toughness.
   At natural concentrations, semipurified secondary metabolites from Rhipocephalus or Udotea deterred feeding by all three herbivores. In most assays, feeding was depressed more by the addition of metabolites from Rhipocephalus or Udotea than by the addition of CaCO3 even though CaCO3 was added at 1.3-2.2 times the natural concentration for these plants. In contrast, the major metabolite from Halimeda goreauii, when tested alone, did not affect feeding by any of the herbivores. In two of our nine assays, the synchronous combination of CaCO3 and secondary metabolites acted synergistically and deterred feeding significantly more than the sum of the effects of each tested separately. Mechanisms producing these synergisms are unknown, but it is possible that calcification could also be acting as a chemical defense by altering gut pH in ways that increase the potency of the secondary metabolites. It is common for chemical, structural, morphological, and nutritional deterrents to co-occur in individual prey species. For some plant-herbivore interactions, the combined effects of these characteristics can be much more than the sum of their separate effects.

AB This study examines direct and indirect interactions that influence the distribution of larvae of the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and green frog (R. clamitans) along the environmental gradient of permanent to temporary ponds. The bullfrog is found in permanent ponds that typically contain fish, whereas the green frog is widely distributed along the gradient and is most successful in ponds where the bullfrog is absent. In a set of experimental ponds, bullfrogs were most abundant in ponds containing fish (bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus) and were rare in permanent ponds that lacked fish. In contrast, green frogs were most abundant in ponds that had been drained the previous fall, second most abundant in those that lacked fish, and sparse in ponds containing bluegill. When presence and absence of bluegill were experimentally manipulated in divided ponds, bullfrogs survived well in the presence of bluegill, whereas no individuals survived in the absence of bluegill. Green frogs survived in low numbers under both treatments with a tendency to better survivorship in the absence of bluegill. A series of laboratory choice experiments was conducted with three major predator types: the dragonfly larva Anax junius, the salamander Ambystoma tigrinum, and L. macrochirus. Bullfrog larvae were more vulnerable to Anax and Ambystoma than were green frogs (because of higher activity levels), and green frogs were more vulnerable to bluegill than were bullfrogs (because tadpoles were less noxious). We argue that the high densities of bullfrogs found in the presence of bluegill reflect an indirect facilitation through two pathways: bluegill had strong negative effects on invertebrate and salamander predators of bullfrogs and on the green frog, which is a bullfrog competitor. The direct and indirect effects of these suites of predators appear to explain the differences in species abundances along the environmental gradient. Finally, we discuss the trade-offs at the individual level contributing to these differences in species performance along the gradient.

AB Patch depression is an essential premise of optimal patch use models. We studied the relationship between patch residence time and intake by Bos taurus. The hypotheses were: (1) grazing changes sward structure and thus, causes patch depression; (2) patches are grazed systematically, by horizon; (3) at equal herbage mass per unit area, tall and sparse swards yield larger bites and thus, exhibit faster and greater depletion than short dense ones.
   In one experiment, we constructed 0.46-m2 swards of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with two contrasting structures but equal herbage mass. In a second experiment we mowed a perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) field to produce 0.36-m2 patches of three heights (7, 12.5, and 18 cm). The animals were allowed to remove different numbers of bites from each patch type, and we measured bite mass, intake, and residence time. Bite dimensions and location (fresh or grazed area) were also recorded in the first experiment.
   In the first experiment, bite mass was initially larger and decreased more steeply with residence time in the tall sparse swards than in the short dense ones. Because bite dimensions and mass declined but time per bite did not change, instantaneous intake rate declined as patches were grazed. Animals grazed systematically and removed most of the top half of the canopy before biting into the lower horizon. A rectangular hyperbola described intake curves (cumulative intake vs. time) well but ignored the abrupt change in instantaneous intake rate when the top horizon was depleted. A model based on the horizon grazing style accurately depicted this change in slope but disregarded the reduction in bite mass within horizons. Intake curves for the field patches were more variable than for hand-constructed patches, but were well described by a rectangular hyperbola. Taller patches had more herbage mass and allowed greater bite mass than shorter ones. Therefore, intake curves had initially steeper slopes and approached higher asymptotes than in shorter patches. Grazers experienced patch depression at the scale of feeding stations. Plant height and density are the causal factors of this process.

AB Crucian carp (Carassius carassius) is often the only fish species present in small ponds of northern Europe. Such populations are typically at high densities and consist primarily of small, relatively slender, and short-lived fish; populations in multispecies assemblages in lakes display opposite traits. Field and laboratory experiments have implicated predation as an important mechanism structuring crucian populations in multispecies assemblages. To investigate the role(s) of density dependence in structuring pond populations, we manipulated densities of crucians stocked into four sections of a subdivided natural pond in Finland.
   Mortality of stocked fish during the 3-mo experiment was low (0-11%) and unrelated to density. Growth rates of crucians were both size and density dependent. Larger fish did not noticeably grow in either high- or low-density sections, but growth of smaller size classes was 22% greater in low-density sections. Lower densities and smaller sizes of zooplankton, especially of inshore cladocerans that are an important food resource for smaller crucians, indicated that resource limitation caused by exploitation competition was an important density-dependent process restricting growth of small fish in high-density sections.
   Crucians rely on reserves of glycogen, stored in the liver and muscle, to fuel the over-winter anaerobic metabolism that allows them to maintain populations in ponds where winter hypoxia eliminates other fishes. Liver size was significantly larger and glycogen levels were 82% higher in our low-density pond sections than in high-density sections. At higher, but not lower, densities, relative liver size and glycogen levels decreased with body size; combined with the lack of growth of large fish, this indicates that density-dependent energy limitations contribute to the short life-spans and rarity of large fish that characterize pond populations.
   An increase in relative body depth can be induced in crucians by the presence of piscivorous fish, reducing vulnerability to predation. It has been proposed that increased body depth incurs a substantial energy cost during swimming and should be restricted to specific size classes in populations sympatric with predators. However, in our experiment, crucians of all sizes became significantly deeper bodied, which contributed to higher condition factors in low-density vs. high-density sections. This morphological change, occurring in the absence of piscivores, suggests that energy benefits (accumulation of overwintering reserves) can override any proposed costs for this sluggish, but metabolically unique, fish.
   Crucian carp successfully reproduced in all sections during the experiment, but growth and recruitment of 0+ fish (young of year) were strongly and negatively related to the numbers of older fish present. The observed density-dependent recruitment was likely caused by starvation-induced mortality and cannibalism; reduced growth observed in O+ fish would also be expected to cause higher first-winter mortality, reducing further recruitment at higher densities. Density dependence has a variety of regulatory effects on pond populations of crucian carp that contribute to their persistence and resilience.

AB In northern Wisconsin lakes, the introduced crayfish Orconectes rusticus is replacing O. propinquus, a previous invader, and O. virilis, a native crayfish. Herein, we explore how fish predation and competition interact to drive this change in crayfish species composition. In outside pools, we conducted selective predation experiments exposing crayfish to largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, to quantify patterns of crayfish vulnerability. To determine how interactions among crayfish influence susceptibility, we quantified shelter use and behavioral interactions among crayfish in aquaria and outside pools.
   At equal size, O, virilis was more susceptible to fish predation than either of the invaders, O. rusticus and O. propinquus; the two invaders were equally susceptible to predation. However, sizes of these crayfish in the field are O. virilis > O. rusticus > O. propinquus. Because fish predators prefer small crayfish, at unequal size, small O. propinquus were more vulnerable to predation than large O. rusticus. Thus, O. rusticus can replace O. propinquus due to natural size differences. Although O. virilis grows larger than the invaders, it was more susceptible even when 3 mm larger. We hypothesized that O. virilis, although large, participated in behaviors that increased its risk to predation.
   When provided with unlimited shelters, all three species increased refuge use under predatory risk. When shelters were limiting and fish present, O. virilis was excluded from shelters by invaders. O. virilis also participated in risky behaviors, such as increased activity and swimming. Both agonistic interactions with congeners and approaches by largemouth bass increased risky behaviors in O. virilis. In addition, O. virilis was innately less aggressive than invaders. Given these behaviors, O. virilis was consumed at high rates and would be eventually replaced in lakes.
   In northern Wisconsin lakes, fish predation and crayfish-crayfish competition interact to influence crayfish replacements. Based on our results, largemouth bass predation modifies the outcome of interference competition among the three crayfishes and, in turn, competitive interactions among the crayfishes influence susceptibility to fish predation. We predict that O. virilis should suffer high mortality to fish predation in the presence, rather than in the absence, of the two invading species. Our results support the hypothesis that, in areas of sympatry where predators are selective and prey species compete, predation and competition interact to determine community structure.

AB Detailed studies of the density-dependent interactions of larval and adult life stages of Drosophila melanogaster suggest that the stability of populations is dependent on environmental variables. Models of Drosophila population dynamics predict that the levels of food supplied to the adults and larvae will have important effects on population stability: stability is enhanced when adults are given low amounts of food and larvae are given high amounts of food. Experimental results presented here are consistent with these general predictions. These observations have implications for the management of biological populations and present an opportunity for studying the evolution of population stability.

AB I determined the impact of resins canals of Bursera schlechtendalii on the growth and survival of its specialized vein-cutting beetle Blepharida sp. nov.
   Bursera schlechtendalii produces terpenes stored under pressure in networks of canals that run throughout the cortex of the stem and in the leaves. When a leaf is broken, it releases abundant resins, which may bathe the leaf surface and often form a squirt that travels for up to 150 cm. Plants vary in the proportion of their leaves that release resins after damage. Larvae of the chrysomelid genus Blepharida can inflict substantial damage to plants because they avoid the squirt response by cutting the leaf veins before consuming the leaves. Nevertheless, resins still protect plants against this insect. Both naturally occurring and experimentally placed larvae had higher mortality on highly responsive plants. Young larvae became mired in secretions after rupturing the canals and died. Also, on highly responsive plants larvae spent more time cutting veins and grew more slowly. Thus, while the squirt response of Bursera is not a completely effective defense, it imposes a handling-time cost on larvae, reduces their growth rate, and increases their mortality.

AB Predictive indicators of the rate of ecosystem recovery after a perturbation (resilience) could be valuable tools for ecological studies that need to anticipate system response to perturbation. We used a simulation model of summer phosphorus cycling in north temperate lakes to (1) evaluate whether resilience decreases with increasing food web length and increases with increasing nutrient loading and (2) test the correspondence between two potential indicators of resilience (nutrient turnover rate, NTR, and the dominant eigenvalue, lambda(max)) and postperturbation measurements of recovery rate. We determined lambda(max) and NTR for reference simulations of planktivore- and piscivore-dominated food webs at three baseline phosphorus loading rates (0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 mu g.L(-1).d(-1)), then measured recovery rates from simulated pulses of available phosphorus. The planktivore-dominated (short) food web was more resilient at baseline phosphorus loading rates of 0.1 and 1.0 mu g.L(-1).d(-1). However, the piscivore-dominated (long) food web was more resilient at the highest baseline phosphorus loading rate (2.0 mu g.L(-1).d(-1)), apparently because the additional nutrients were incorporated into biota more rapidly. Recovery rates predicted from NTR (but not from lambda(max)) were consistent with measured recovery rates. NTR appears to be a useful predictor of lake ecosystem recovery from nutrient pulses, particularly because it can be estimated relatively easily. Field tests comparing preperturbation estimates of NTR and postperturbation recovery rates are necessary to further validate this approach.

AB We determined if drought-induced nitrogen retranslocation occurs in perennial grasses of tallgrass prairie, as suggested from studies of annual changes in plant N content. To test this, we analyzed six C-4 grasses representing a wide range of drought tolerance for shoot, rhizome, and root N before and after controlled drought. Shoot N concentration decreased in all species during drought (31-41%), including in recently expanded leaves (23-38%). No consistent pattern with respect to drought tolerance was apparent in these decreases or in observed changes in distribution of whole-plant N, although there was some suggestion of a mesic-to-xeric gradient in the magnitude of retranslocation. For example, the proportion of total plant N allocated to shoots decreased during drought 20-29% in the most mesic species over three experiments, 2-12% in the three intermediate species, and 4-6% in the two most xeric species, for pre- vs. post-drought comparisons. However, when drought-stressed plants were compared to well-watered age controls, the respective values were 20-21%, 12-20%, and 0-19%, the apparent result of size-related changes in N allocation in control plants in one experiment. In most cases, shoot N was moved primarily into rhizomes, though in one species with intermediate drought tolerance, evidence suggested that much of the retranslocated shoot N was apparently lost through fine-root turnover. Retranslocation of shoot N to rhizomes and roots, confirmed by monitoring movement of S-35-methionine, was in response to drought stress rather than phenology and involved the entire shoot (e.g., blades, culms, recently expanded leaves). Post-drought photosynthesis and leaf N concentration remained well below predrought levels 6 d following rewatering. Thus decreases in leaf N status during drought as a consequence of retranslocation likely result in lower photosynthetic capacity and decreased whole-plant carbon gain following relief of water stress after rain. Drought-induced retranslocation may serve to protect plant N from loss to herbivory, fire, and volatilization during periods when soil N uptake and carbon assimilation are limited by water availability.

AB How can measurements of population dynamics be used to deduce the mechanisms of interaction in an assemblage of species? We present a technique to use such measurements to distinguish among assemblages of species with no direct interactions, sets of species influenced predominantly by pairwise interactions, and communities with significant interaction modification. We define the interaction coefficients and show that their dependence on the population sizes of the various species reveals and pinpoints interactions. Our technique distinguishes non-additivity in the statistical sense from interaction modification in the biological sense.

AB We quantified production dynamics, determined the trophic basis of production, and assessed the overlap in resource utilization within a diverse assemblage of mayfly larvae from the submerged woody (snag) habitat of a Coastal Plain blackwater river (Ogeechee River). Total annual production (as dry mass) was among the highest reported for mayflies, ranging from 20.8 to 42.2 g/m(2) of snag surface (7.4 to 12.3 g/m(2) of channel bottom) in two consecutive years. Relatively little change occurred between years for four out of six families. Biomass turnover rates (annual production/biomass) were generally high, ranging from 8 (single generation per year) to 96 (multiple generations per year) for individual taxa. Distinct types of temporal production patterns occurred: (1) concentration in winter (Ephemerella argo, E. dorothea, Eurylophella sp., and Isonychia), (2) concentration in summer (Baetis ephippiatus, Tricorythodes sp., Caenis spp.), or (3) spread throughout the year and peaking in summer (Baetis intercalaris, Stenonema modestum, S. integrum, S. exiguum, and Hexagenia sp.). Temporal overlap of production, using the proportional similarity index, was highest among closely related taxa (>0.60), with the least overlap (<0.15) among taxa in different families. Overlap based upon the amount that various food types contribute to production was high among all species, suggesting even less resource partitioning for food than for time. Of the. annual food consumption (as dry mass) by mayflies per unit snag surface area (423 g.m(-2).yr(-1)), approximate to 87% consisted of amorphous detritus that is rapidly replenished on snags from floodplain-derived seston. This food source accounted for approximate to 70% of total mayfly production. We suggest that a fluctuating habitat (snags), a continuously replenished food supply, high biomass turnover, and high drift densities help perpetuate a persistent, resilient, and diverse mayfly assemblage with little resource partitioning.

AB The distribution and extinction patterns within a northern metapopulation of the pool frog (Rana lessonae) were analyzed with reference to metapopulation theory. Occupied ponds were permanent and differed from unoccupied ones in terms of higher water temperature during May-June and a closer proximity to neighboring pool-frog localities, but local climate was not spatially autocorrelated. Two types of population extinctions occurred (average rate = 2% per population and year): (1) deterministic extinctions due to succession or draining of pool-frog ponds, and (2) extinctions of populations whose isolation had increased to a critical degree because of Type 1 extinctions of neighboring populations, increasing their susceptibility to predation and combined demographic/environmental stochasticity. The Type 2 extinctions were spatially correlated to a moderate degree, which may reflect the great impact of environmental stochasticity in the system. The results confirm and emphasize the importance of interpopulation proximity and connectivity for metapopulation persistence.

AB The phenological relationships between nesting behavior of a specialist, solitary bee, Dieunomia triangulifera, and the flowering of its primary pollen source, Helianthus annuus, were studied for 3 yr at a site in northeastern Kansas, which contained between 50 000 and > 150 000 nests. Activity patterns of D. triangulifera are closely synchronized with pollen availability on nearby sunflower plants in three ways: (1) each year, D. triangulifera became active within days of the beginning of the local sunflower bloom, and the emergence schedule of the entire population at the nest site was timed such that all females had constructed nests and were collecting pollen at peak bloom; (2) over a season the greatest numbers of provisioning females were active at peak bloom, when pollen was most abundant; and (3) over the day, females made mote trips, each of which took less time when pollen was most abundant on nearby flowers than when it was scarce. Between seasons, female reproductive success varied positively with the availability of H. annuus pollen. When pollen was abundant, and the population at the nest site was low, approximate to 3 times more cells were provisioned than the following year when the bee population was high and pollen abundance declined. Furthermore, 20 pollen-collecting bee species (10 specialists and 10 generalists), besides D. triangulifera, used an estimated 68% of the available sunflower pollen at this site. These data suggest that resource limitation is important in shaping patterns of provisioning behavior in D. triangulifera. Other behaviors presumably related to reproductive success were variable and suggest resources were not limiting: (1) all females did not forage on each day, even at peak bloom; (2) variance in both trip durations and the numbers of trips made per day was large; and (3) females produced far fewer eggs in their lifetime than apparently possible. We suggest that the apparently conflicting evidence for resource limitation may be explained by a physiological Limit on the rate of egg production; in such a case, the effects of resource limitation, while clearly important, might not be the primary factor limiting reproductive output.
   Female D. triangulifera benefit by being synchronized with their resource. Daily and seasonal synchrony enable females to collect a greater amount of pollen during shorter foraging trips. This translates into higher mean reproductive success and, at the population level, allows more females to be supported by the pollen produced from nearby plants. In short, those females that are synchronized with the sunflower bloom effectively increase their own resource availability. This phenomenon may be general, especially in short-lived organisms, i.e., the evolution of specialization may be associated with fitness benefits based on synchrony with a preferred food source.

AB Phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, and pond smelt were collected in a eutrophic lake (Lake Suwa, Japan) from spring to autumn in 1986 and 1987. Their stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios were analyzed together with conventional examination of the gut contents of pond smelt. Temporal variations in isotope ratios were similar among the organisms other than benthic animals. The deltaN-15 values of diet for several animals in the pelagic food web were estimated, assuming a stepwise enrichment in N-15 with increasing trophic level. A calanoid copepod, Eodiaptomus japonicus, seemed to feed on the predominant phytoplankton, including Microcystis spp., while Microcystis did not seem to be important as an organic source for other zooplankton and pond smelt. The temporal variation of the isotope ratios of pond smelt was well explained by visual gut content analysis. It is suggested that intensive measurements of carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of each species serve to effectively assess the yearly dynamics of the food web structure in eutrophic lakes where productivity and species composition of plankton change seasonally.

AB This report assesses the role of specialist parasitoids in providing a major selection pressure for food plant preference in herbivorous insects. Three Pieris butterflies, P. rapae crucivora, P. melete, and P. napi japonica, use different sets of cruciferous larval food plants. P. rapae is oligophagous and uses ephemeral plants. P. melete is polyphagous and uses persistent plants, as well as all of the ephemeral plants used by P. rapae. On the other hand, P. napi is locally monophagous, using persistent Arabis.
   We assessed the intrinsic suitability of these crucifers by measuring survival rates, development times, and pupal mass of larvae growing on them at a constant temperature. All of the food plants of P. rapae and P. melete are suitable for larvae of the three Pieris species. On the other hand, food plants of P. napi are the least suitable for all three species.
   Pieris larvae have two specialist parasitoids, the braconid wasp Cotesia glomerata (formerly Apanteles glomeratus) and the tachinid fly Epicampocera succincta. In newly established habitats, P. rapae can avoid both parasitoids. In long-lasting habitats, however, P. rapae is heavily parasitized by both parasitoids. P. melete and P. napi, by contrast, live only in long-lasting habitats, where the parasitic pressure is potentially high. However, P. melete can partially avoid parasitism by killing the eggs of C. glomerata by encapsulation, though parasitized by E. succincta. On the other hand, P. napi seems to have evolved behavioral avoidance of parasitoids by specializing on Arabis plants.
   The different food plant preferences of the three Pieris species can be interpreted as resulting from differences in the balance of a trade-off between parasitoid avoidance and the intrinsic quality of potential food plants to Pieris species.

AB Freshwater zooplankton communities typically undergo pronounced seasonal succession and often show dramatic responses to external factors such as changes in zooplanktivore abundance. For this reason it is important to assess how common zooplankton species differ in their grazing impacts on planktonic ecosystems. To accomplish this we used single-species treatments with Diacyclops bicuspidatus thomasi, Daphnia rosea, Diaptomus novamexicanus, and Holopedium gibberum in situ in Castle Lake, California. These taxonomically diverse zooplankters differ markedly in feeding modes and typical seasonal population dynamics. We measured the response of nutrient concentrations, bacterioplankton abundance, phytoplankton species composition and biomass, primary production, a grazing index (phaeophytin/chlorophyll a), and microzooplankton to our single-species treatments.
   The filter-feeding cladocerans Daphnia and Holopedium and the raptorial filter-feeding calanoid copepod Diaptomus showed several effects typical of herbivorous zooplankton. These included increasing dissolved nutrient concentrations, decreasing algal biomass and the abundance of several common algae, increasing a grazing index, increasing the ratio of bacterial to algal biomass, as well as depressing ciliate microzooplankton abundance. The raptorial cyclopoid copepod Diacyclops was apparently exclusively predaceous as it decimated the ciliate and rotifer microzooplankton, but had no notable effect on the other measured parameters relative to zooplankton-free controls. Diacyclops had the greatest effect on the microzooplankton and Daphnia and Diaptomus had the greatest effect on inorganic nutrients and characteristics of the phytoplankton, Holopedium had qualitatively similar but weaker impacts compared to Daphnia and Diaptomus. None of the zooplankton treatments had an effect on bacterioplankton abundance, nor did grazing by any of these zooplankters increase total algal primary production. Our results suggest differences in the grazing effects of common freshwater zooplankton can be pronounced and indicate that both seasonal succession and long-term shifts in the zooplankton community structure should have marked effects on microzooplankton competitors and prey, the phytoplankton, and nutrient cycling.

AB We measured shoot architecture and photosynthesis by three species of maple (Acer pensylvanicum, A. rubrum, A. saccharum) in response to understory and small canopy gaps in the mixed deciduous forests of central New England. Trees were felled to create six cleared gaps of two sizes(8 x 12 m, 75 m(2); 16 x 24 m, 300 m(2)). Seedlings of the three species (2160 total, 720 per species) were transplanted into five plot locations (center plus northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast gap edges) within all gaps and additional understory sites 1 yr before gap creation. Measurements of microclimates, architecture, photosynthetic performance, and seedling survival and growth were made over 1 yr before, and 2 yr following, gap release.
   Architectural variation increased greatly over the 3-yr period. Striped maple (A. pensylvanicum) and red maple C4. rubrum) increased branch numbers, leaf numbers, and total leaf areas in gaps, especially large gaps, while sugar maple (A. saccharum) showed much smaller changes. Red maple tended to increase the number of leaves while leaf size decreased; striped maple increased leaf number but held leaf size constant.
   Diurnal patterns of photosynthesis by these species differed within and between gap and understory sites. Red maple showed higher photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area than striped and sugar maple in all site/plot combinations except the large-gap south plots, where striped maple exceeded red maple. Estimated diurnal shoot-level assimilation differentiated species more than unit area assimilation rates and also altered the rank order of performance, with striped maple > red maple > sugar maple in all microsites except the large-gap north.
   Population-level assimilation vs. irradiance response curves exhibited a similar pattern, with red maple dominating unit area rates in most plot microsites. In contrast, shoot assimilation curves showed striped maple > red maple > sugar maple in all microsites except the large-gap north, where red maple > striped maple.
   Architectural variation among these species interacted with leaf-level assimilation rates to produce some differences among these species in shoot-level assimilation across the gap understory microclimatic gradient. Since survival and growth patterns are usually correlated with differences in whole-plant carbon assimilation, our results suggest that there is some photosynthetic potential for gap partitioning among these three species of Acer.

AB Selection of a proper model as a basis for statistical inference from capture-recapture data is critical. This is especially so when using open models in the analysis of multiple, interrelated data sets (e.g., males and females, with 2-3 age classes, over 3-5 areas and 10-15 yr). The most general model considered for such data sets might contain 1000 survival and recapture parameters. This paper presents numerical results on three information-theoretic methods for model selection when the data are overdispersed (i.e., a lack of independence so that extra-binomial variation occurs). Akaike's information criterion (AIC), a second-order adjustment to AIC for bias (AIC(c)), and a dimension-consistent criterion (CAIC) were modified using an empirical estimate of the average overdispersion, based on quasi-likelihood theory. Quality of model selection was evaluated based on the Euclidian distance between standardized <(theta)over cap> and theta (parameter theta is vector valued); this quantity (a type of residual sum of squares, hence denoted as RSS) is a combination of squared bias and variance. Five results seem to be of general interest for these product-multinomial models. First, when there was overdispersion the most direct estimator of the variance inflation factor was positively biased and the relative bias increased with the amount of overdispersion. Second, AIC and AIC(c), unadjusted for overdispersion using quasi-likelihood theory, performed poorly in selecting a model with a small RSS value when the data were overdispersed (i.e., overfitted models were selected when compared to the model with the minimum RRS value). Third, the information-theoretic criteria, adjusted for overdispersion, performed well, selected parismonious models, and had a good balance between under- and overfitting the data. Fourth, generally, the dimension-consistent criterion selected models with fewer parameters than the other criteria, had smaller RSS values, but clearly was in error by underfitting when compared with the model with the minimum RSS value. Fifth, even if the true model structure (but not the actual parameter values in the model) is known, that true model, when fitted to the data (by parameter estimation) is a relatively poor basis for statistical inference when that true model includes several, let alone many, estimated parameters that are not significantly different from O.

AB Pollination of lobelia deckenii, an African giant rosette lobelia, results from foraging by the Mountain Chat (Cercomela sordida) and the Scarlet-tufted Malachite Sunbird (Nectarinia johnstoni). I measured three components of bird behavior leading to fertilization and seed set: (1) the arrival rate of birds at focal inflorescences, (2) the number of probes for nectar made during a visit, and (3) the number of seeds set per probe. Predicted frequency distributions of seed set per flower, derived by compounding distributions for the three components, match some qualitative and quantitative features of actual seed set patterns. Stochastic variation in all three components, along with the modular packaging of ovules in individual flowers, results in high variance among flowers in their contribution to whole-plant female reproductive success, with most flowers receiving inadequate fertilizations for full seed set. The analysis points to the importance of viewing female reproductive success in plants as a composite entity. Although most flowers of Lobelia deckenii would set more seeds if additional pollen were acquired, sufficient control of pollinator behavior to achieve full fertilization in all fruits may not be possible. The inherent stochastic variation in fitness contributions among individual flowers may have a large influence on the evolution of reproductive traits, including packaging strategies and inflorescence morphologies.

AB A standardized neighbor removal experiment was conducted in 12 plant communities located on three continents to test the null hypothesis that competition intensity (CI) was independent of the amount of plant biomass present. Six plots were chosen in each community to cover the range of local variation in plant biomass. In each plot the relative growth rate (RGR) of transplanted Poa pratensis (Poaceae) seedlings was compared in the presence and absence of neighbors. Neighbors were removed experimentally using herbicide. Removing neighbors increased RGR of transplants significantly in most plots. CI increased with an increase in the amount of neighbor biomass present in one community where the range of neighbor biomass was greater than in any other community. In contrast, CI did not change significantly with an increase in neighbor biomass in other communities where the range of neighbor biomass was smaller. For the communities combined, CI was not related to neighbor biomass in a consistent fashion. These results indicate that competition may reduce growth over a wide range of habitat productivity, but the relationship between CI and neighbor biomass may differ among communities.

AB Spatial and temporal variation in the recruitment of dispersive life stages can strongly affect the distribution, dynamics, structure, and gene flow of local populations. I investigated the causes of variable larval recruitment to populations of a temperate reef fish, the kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus). Spatial and temporal variation in the density of settlement habitat on a reef, the giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), explained much of the variation in recruitment of kelp bass. Although recruitment was positively related to Macrocystis density, the relationship was asymptotic at high plant densities, indicating that kelp bass recruitment saturates at intermediate densities of Macrocystis (approximate to 100-130 stipes/ 30 m(2)). Field experiments demonstrated causation between Macrocystis density and kelp bass recruitment and indicated that kelp bass recruitment was linearly related to the local abundance of kelp structure (i.e., the number and biomass of overlapping Macrocystis blades). This linear (nonasymptotic) relationship between Macrocystis blade biomass and density of fish recruits indicated that both the quantity and quality of the recruitment habitat limited larval recruitment. Structural complexity per unit length of plant (e.g., blade biomass per unit plant length) was inversely related to plant density. This relationship underlies the asymptotic relationship between structural complexity per unit reef area (the product of per-plant structural complexity and plant density) and recruit density. Thus, density-dependent constraints on blade biomass in this macroalga, rather than larval supply, better explained the general asymptotic nature of the relationship between Macrocystis and kelp bass recruitment. These results indicate that density-dependent effects on plant biomass and architecture (e.g., plant height and structural complexity), common among both macrophytes and terrestrial plants, can greatly influence the relationship between plant density and recruitment of other species. For organisms with dispersive life stages whose local recruitment is influenced by the occurrence of living habitat structure, spatial and temporal variability characteristic of such biogenic habitats can be a major source of variation in their recruitment.

AB Periodic matrix models are used to describe the effects of cyclic environmental variation, both seasonal and interannual, on population dynamics. If the environmental cycle is of length m, with matrices B-(1), B-(2),..., B-(m) describing population growth during the m phases of the cycle, then population growth over the whole cycle is given by the product matrix A = B-(m)B-(m-1)...B-(1).
   The sensitivity analysis of such models is complicated because the entries in A are complicated combinations of the entries in the matrices B-(i), and thus do not correspond to easily interpreted life history parameters. In this paper we show how to calculate the sensitivity and elasticity of population growth rate to changes in the entries in the individual matrices B-(i) making up a periodic matrix product. These calculations reveal seasonal patterns in sensitivity that are impossible to detect with sensitivity analysis based on the matrix A. We also show that the vital rates interact in important ways: the sensitivity to changes in a rate at one point in the cycle may depend strongly on changes in other rates at other points in the cycle.

AB Cascading trophic interactions are important in many freshwater pelagic food webs, but their importance in more complex, omnivore-rich littoral-zone food webs is less well known. We tested the existence of a trophic cascade involving omnivorous crayfish (Orconectes rusticus), macroinvertebrates, periphyton, and macrophytes using 9-m(2) cages in the littoral zone of Plum Lake, Wisconsin, USA. Treatments in the replicated (N = 4) experiment were crayfish enclosures, crayfish exclosures, and cageless references. During June-September, we measured macrophyte shoot numbers, macroinvertebrate numbers, and periphyton (on plastic strips) chlorophyll a, and dry mass (DM). We expected that crayfish foraging would directly reduce abundance and change species composition of macrophytes and macroinvertebrates and would indirectly enhance periphyton abundance by reducing the abundance of grazing snails.
   In enclosures, macrophyte and snail (but not nonsnail macroinvertebrate) densities declined significantly throughout the experiment, whereas densities of macrophytes, snails, and nonsnail macroinvertebrates increased in exclosures and cageless references. Some of the reduction in macrophytes resulted from nonconsumptive fragmentation of macrophytes by crayfish. Consistent with the cascading trophic interactions model, periphyton chlorophyll a per unit surface area increased in enclosures, but declined in exclosures. Periphyton quality (as indexed by chlorophyll a/DM) also increased in enclosures relative to exclosures and cageless references. However, because of large reductions in macrophyte surface area (which periphyton colonizes) in enclosures, total amount of periphyton chlorophyll a in enclosures (relative to exclosures) probably declined while periphyton quantity per unit surface area and periphyton quality increased. Thus, the impacts of crayfish omnivory on periphyton, expressed in two conflicting indirect effects, confirm the possibility that omnivory can complicate cascading trophic predictions. Overall, results support the existence of strong trophic interactions in the littoral zone, in which omnivorous crayfish control abundance of macrophytes, snails, and periphyton.

AB Factors that affect traits of aquatic larvae of amphibians may have longlasting effects on terrestrial juveniles and adults. I manipulated larval densities of marbled salamanders, Ambystoma opacum, in large-scale field enclosures during 2 yr, released the juveniles that metamorphosed from these enclosures, and tested for effects on adults that returned to the pond during 6-7 subsequent breeding seasons. Individuals from low larval density treatments tended to have greater lipid stores at metamorphosis than those from high densities and survived longer in a laboratory inanition study. In the field, individuals that experienced low larval density returned for their first reproductive bout as larger adults than those from high-density treatments. For 5-yr-old females released in 1986, low larval density was linked to greater clutch size; clutch size in 4-yr-old animals from the 1987 cohort did not differ between larval treatment groups. Larval density also influenced age at first reproduction, as animals reared at low densities returned to breed at younger ages. Averaged across both cohorts, the proportion of animals that returned to breed at least once was 21% for low-density groups compared to 6% for the high-density groups. The larval environment exerted a strong influence on postmetamorphic traits, and thus larval density likely plays an important role in population regulation in both the aquatic and terrestrial phase of the life cycle.

AB The aim of this study was (1) to evaluate the importance of dormant buds for the bud demography of the mountain birch Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa near the tree line and (2) to study whether sexual reproduction leads to costs for bud production rates. A bud population census was taken in two consecutive years for six branches of each of 90 mountain birch trees. The trees were growing in a common garden and belonged to 10 different progenies originating from different parts of Finnish Lapland. The data were analyzed with matrix population models. The most important transformations of the bud populations were between vegetative short and long shoots. However, if most apparently dead buds are actually latent dormants, they make an even more important contribution to the bud population growth rate than vegetative long and short shoots. Dormant buds may have considerable importance especially after events such as herbivore outbreaks, in which short and long shoots are damaged. Generative long shoots (with male catkins) and short shoots (with female catkins) had approximately the same bud production rate as the corresponding vegetative shoots, i.e., bud populations did not show any major costs due to sexual reproduction. Meristem costs, i.e., a decrease in the number of buds due to sexual reproduction, may be relatively low in mountain birch, because new axillary buds develop and compensate for lost shoot apices. This compensation capacity may be especially well developed under suboptimal conditions, where canopy expansion is limited by the harsh environment rather than by the availability of meristems. The resource cost of reproduction (e.g., in terms of carbon or mineral nutrients) may also be partly compensated especially when flowering intensity is sufficiently low.

DE BIRDS; BREEDING BIRD SURVEY; CORRELATION; INDEX; TRENDS; WITHIN-SITE
   VARIABILITY
AB Most large-scale surveys of animal populations are based on counts of individuals observed during a sampling period, which are used as indexes to the population. The variability in these indexes not only reflects variability in population sizes among sites but also variability due to the inexactness of the counts. Repeated counts at survey sites can be used to document this additional source of variability and, in some applications, to mitigate its effects. We present models for evaluating the proportion of total variability in counts that is attributable to this within-site variability and apply them in the analysis of data from repeated counts on routes from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. We analyzed data on 98 species, obtaining estimates of these percentages, which ranged from 3.5 to 100% with a mean of 36.25%. For at least 14 of the species, more than half of the variation in counts was attributable to within-site sources. Counts for species with lower average counts had a higher percentage of within-site variability. We discuss the relative cost efficiency of replicating sites or initiating new sites for several objectives, concluding that it is frequently better to initiate new sites than to attempt to replicate existing sites.

AB With laboratory experiments and held surveys, we examine community-structuring mechanisms in a system undergoing invasion. Orconectes rusticus, an invading crayfish species, is replacing O. propinquus and O. virilis in northern Wisconsin lakes. We test the hypothesis that periodicity of species interactions influences invasion success. Specifically, we test whether the intensity of interspecific competition varies on a diel cycle as a function of predation risk from visually feeding fishes. We tested for competitive exclusion in experimental pools (1.4 m in diameter) by determining habitat use of the three crayfishes in single- and three-species treatments. The pools contained equal area habitats of cobble, open sand, macrophytes in organic sediments (muck), and macrophytes in sand. In single-species treatments, all three species preferred cobble habitat during the day with a secondary preference for muck-macrophyte habitat. In three-species relative to single-species pools, O. rusticus increased daytime use of cobble habitat while O. virilis and O. propinquus reduced use of cobble and increased use of muck-macrophyte and sand-macrophyte habitats, respectively. Crayfish were evenly distributed among habitats at night. All three crayfishes altered habitat use between night and day, consistent with the need to forage at night and seek refuge from predation during the day. Results of a laboratory experiment giving crayfish the choice of feeding in the open or hiding in clean cobble in the presence and absence of a predator showed that crayfish chose habitat on the basis of food availability when predation risk was low and on the basis of shelter availability when risk was high. Data from experiments were consistent with habitat use observed in single-and mixed-species lakes, supporting our hypothesis that the interaction of competition with diel fluctuations in predation risk contributes to the ongoing O. rusticus invasion.

AB The geographic ranges of three extant species of medium-sized canid, the sidestriped (Canis adustus), the golden (C. aureus), and the blackbacked (C. mesomelas) jackal, overlap only in East Africa. Elsewhere each species exists alone or in sympatry with one other jackal species. The fossil record suggests that the golden jackal evolved outside of Africa and joined the other two species in East Africa within the last 500 000 yr. Previous research showed that unlike other sympatric canids, all three jackal species in East Africa are extremely similar in size and overall morphology and thus exhibit no obvious evidence of ecological character displacement. Moreover, the three species do not form a monophyletic group, are distantly related, and thus may have had ample time to diverge morphologically. Here, we explore in further detail the possibility of character displacement in the three species by assessing variation in 62 measures of the skull and teeth for populations of all three species throughout their ranges. The expanded measurement and population sample allows us to explore four possible manifestations of character displacement: (1) divergence in size, (2) divergence in shape, (3) reduced morphological variability, and (4) reduced sexual dimorphism.
   There is no evidence of size divergence among jackals in East Africa; by contrast the three species appear to converge on a similar size. However, divergence in shape is apparent. The recent insinuation of golden jackals into the East African fauna has resulted in character divergence and probable niche compression of blackbacked jackals as evidenced by adaptations for increased carnivory, reduced sexual dimorphism, and reduced variability. The response has been asymmetric as the golden and sidestriped jackals have not diverged functionally or shown niche compression. The pattern of character displacement is likely a function of starting conditions at the time the three became sympatric. The golden jackal exhibits dietary adaptations intermediate to those of the other two species but more similar to those of blackbacked jackals. Thus character displacement was more likely to occur in goldens and blackbacks. Selection for increased carnivory in the blackbacked jackal might have been favored because of the abundance of vertebrate prey in the East African plains. The success of the golden jackal as an insinuator into East Africa suggests that the carnivore guild might not be saturated.

AB Ecological processes often depend upon the patterning, as well as the absolute density, of resources. In this paper, we develop methods for describing pattern from the perspective of the organism encountering and exploiting the resources, and for reconstructing pattern from the description. The essence of our description is the ''structure function,'' which is the probability that a point r units away from the current point contains resources, conditional on the resource state of the current point. We first show how the structure function is determined from pattern and then describe an algorithm (the method of the ''Force to be Full'') for constructing pattern in any number of dimensions from a given structure function. We illustrate our ideas with empirical data from krill surveys and with simulated but complex three-dimensional patterns.

AB Quantitative estimates of the distribution and abundance of trees in northern Florida prior to extensive land development are summarized from Public Land Survey (PLS) records. The PLS data on 127 653 trees at 48 831 sample locations, collected between 1822 and 1854 and tabulated from original field notes, are summarized here to examine the abundance and distribution of major tree species and plant associations. These results are compared to another early, quantified estimate of vegetation published in 1914. These two records of vegetation were compared within 20 vegetation zones in northern Florida. Both data sets describe the vegetation of northern Florida as strongly dominated by pine and similarly describe regions more heavily represented by upland hardwood or forested wetland trees. The data sets differ predominantly in that the PLS data indicate: (1) more pine; (2) less cypress, gum, and sweetgum than the early 20th-century survey; and (3) that, in contrast to major upland hardwood taxa, the representation of major taxa typical of pinelands and forested wetlands is only loosely correlated between data sets. The PLS records were used to map the distribution of species and community types across northern Florida. The PLS data support, and quantify, previously published accounts of the over whelming dominance of pine in the presettlement vegetation of northern Florida. This abundance of pine refutes various hypotheses that mixed hardwood vegetation dominated upland habitats in northern Florida.

AB This study examines size-dependent competitive interactions between larvae of two species of ranid frogs, the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and the green frog (R. clamitans). Surveys of naturally breeding populations on an experimental pond site indicated that the two species often compete in the larval phase, and because both species may overwinter as larvae, interactions can occur between disparate size (year) classes. Using an additive design, I conducted field experiments manipulating densities of four species-class combinations (year I and II bullfrogs and green frogs) in the presence of low numbers of the other classes. The design permitted estimates of the effect of manipulated species/classes on different target classes and, because the latter were held constant, the effects of manipulated classes on themselves. Strong competitive effects were found within and between species/classes with one important exception. Neither class of green frogs affected small bullfrogs despite the fact that both had strong effects on large bullfrogs. Both classes of bullfrogs, however, affected both classes of green frogs. In general, smaller classes had a greater per unit biomass effect on target classes than larger classes and tolerated competitive effects better. Independent of size effects, bullfrogs appeared to be better competitors than green frogs because of other traits, presumably greater activity levels. I interpret these results in terms of a simple model of the ontogenetic scaling of foraging costs and gains. This model enables a mechanistic interpretation of the above results through the two components of competitive interactions, effect and response. Larger classes have greater per capita effects on resources, but because the gain curve is decelerating, smaller classes have greater per unit biomass effects. On the other hand, smaller classes respond less to competitors because net gain for these classes is higher of affected less by a decline in resources. I argue that to understand size-structured interactions in many taxa, we must first isolate the underlying ontogenetic or size-scaling component of competitive relations, and then add to these relations the effects of unique species traits.

AB Current descriptive models of edge effects describe little more than the relationship between perimeter and area. A more realistic model, one that incorporates the additive nature of edge effects, is presented and tested. The total edge effect at a location within a patch is modelled as the sum of edge effects at points along the edges of the patch, weighted by the distances from the edge points to the location. At four sites in the central Amazon approximate to 80 km north of Manaus, Brazil, I measured vertical stratification of foliage in three primary forest habitats: (1) continuous forest close to linear edges, (2) 10-ha forest fragments, and (3) 1-ha forest fragments. Foliage thickness (foliage density along a vertical line) was scored in six height intervals (0-2, 2-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, and 30-40 m). With decreasing distance from a linear edge, understory (0-5 m) foliage thickness increased and overstory (10-30 m) foliage thickness decreased, and the relationship between foliage thickness and distance to the edge agreed with that predicted by the model. Using parameter estimates obtained from the ''best fit'' of the model to these data from linear edges, understory and overstory thickness in 1- and 10-ha fragments was predicted. Foliage thickness varied extensively among fragments, but agreed quite closely with that predicted by the model, and the additive model performed better than a curvilinear non-additive one.

AB Some clonal plant species decrease rhizome or stolen internode lengths and/or increase the frequency of branching when they grow in favorable environments. This ''foraging response'' is thought to be beneficial since it should allow ramets to concentrate in areas of favorable habitat. However, there have been few critical tests of the effectiveness with which ramets are placed in favorable habitat as a result of the foraging response. In this paper, I use empirically calibrated stochastic simulation and diffusion models to compare the growth of clones in favorable and unfavorable habitat. I ask whether observed changes in rhizome lengths and clonal branching patterns are likely to decrease significantly the distance clones move, and thus, to enable ramets to remain for longer periods of time in favorable habitat. For the empirical data used in this study, results from the models indicate that the effectiveness of the foraging response is likely to be variable. In some cases, such as results from models based on the response of Glechoma hederacea to nutrients, there is no significant difference in the distance clones move in favorable and unfavorable habitat. Thus, even though rhizome lengths may be significantly shorter in favorable patches, this does not guarantee that clones disperse significantly less far and thereby remain longer in favorable habitat. The effectiveness of the foraging response depends strongly on the distribution of clonal growth angles, the pattern of clonal branching, and the variance in rhizome or stolen internode length. These results, particularly the importance of growth angles and the relatively limited effectiveness of the foraging response, differ from those in previously published models of foraging in clonal plant species. I conclude with a discussion of reasons that may underlie these differences.

AB Largely synchronous population fluctuations of Clethrionomys glareolus, C. rufocanus, and Microtus agrestis were monitored by snap-trapping in spring and autumn in 1971-1988 in a strongly seasonal environment near UmeA, northern Sweden. All species were cyclic in the sense that they showed fairly regular (3-4 yr) fluctuations, but amplitudes ((max)/n(min)) varied, averaging almost-equal-to 200-fold in each species. This conclusion was supported by autocorrelation and spectral analysis, and by fitting time series data to a model for phase-forgetting cycles. By contrast, data did not conform to a model for phase-remembering cycles (with fixed period and amplitude).
   The transition between cycles, i.e., from the low to increase phase, was characterized by a distinct shift in rate of change in numbers from low to high or markedly higher values both in summer and winter. Generally, rate of change in summer declined continuously from the increase phase through each cycle. Moreover, there was a similar decrease of rate of change in winter, although rate of change (mainly in C. rufocanus and M. agrestis) first frequently increased early in the cycle. Rate of change was delayed density dependent in all species both in summer and winter, as revealed by high negative correlations with density in previous autumn and spring for summer and winter changes, respectively. These new findings of delayed density dependence (DDD) support the suggestion that vole cycles are generated by a time-lag mechanism. Possible mechanisms of the DDD are discussed.
   Regression analyses of rate of change in the different voles suggest that, besides the strong dependence on previous density, rate of change in numbers was also affected by current seed supply (in C glareolus) and/or weather variables (temperature and precipitation sums) that may have affected the quantity or quality of food.

AB This study documents the existence of a food plant related palatability spectrum in Florida queen butterflies (Danaus gilippus). Abdomens of butterflies reared on four asclepiad food plants differed significantly in cardenolide content and palatability to a generalist avian predator (Red-winged Blackbird). However, unpalatability did not directly parallel food plant or butterfly cardenolide content. Queens reared on Sarcostemma clausum were cardenolide free and essentially palatable (85% eaten). Butterflies reared on Asclepias tuberosa and A. incarnata were also virtually cardenolide free, but were weakly and moderately unpalatable, respectively (62 and 46% eaten). Queens reared on the high-cardenolide Asclepias curassavica contained 101-753 mug cardenolide and were very unpalatable (8% eaten). These results suggest that in addition to cardenolides, other asclepiad phytochemicals are directly or indirectly utilized by queens as components of their systemic chemical defense.
   The demonstrated variation in queen palatability is predicted to affect the aversive conditioning of predators and thus the outcome of queen-predator encounters. Queen populations feeding on more than one asclepiad species must exhibit automimicry, with attack rates on individual butterflies dependent upon both the proportion of palatable automimics and the noxiousness of unpalatable automodels in the population.
   The verification of a queen palatability spectrum also contributes to understanding the dynamics of mimicry between queens and viceroy butterflies (Limenitis archippus). This study predicts that, as a consequence of regional differences in asclepiad floras, the viceroy-queen mimicry relationship in Florida switches between the Batesian and Mullerian mimicry modes. In the extreme, queens feeding on certain food plants may be Batesian mimics of sympatric, moderately unpalatable viceroys, reversing the traditionally cited mimicry roles of these butterflies.

AB Although numerous studies have addressed plant compensatory responses to removal of vegetative tissue by herbivores, only a few have determined the effect of floral removal on subsequent seed production in natural populations. In Sanicula arctopoides, a perennial monocarp, removal of inflorescences (umbels), both naturally by deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and by artificial clipping early in the flowering season, led to no loss of maternal reproduction as measured by seed number and seed mass. Full compensation occurred when umbels bearing up to one-third of a plant's flowers were removed at the stage when plants are normally grazed. However, there are thresholds both in timing and severity of removal beyond which plants were unable to compensate fully. Compared to controls, artificial removal of developing fruits 20 d later than the normal stage resulted in a 42% decrease in seed production. Successive clippings that removed approximate to 55% of each plant's flowers resulted in a 52% decrease in seed production relative to controls; however, a single clipping of the same intensity resulted in full compensation.
   Differential reactions to clipping of different umbel ranks provided information about the mechanism of the response. Removal of secondary umbels resulted in decreased seed abortion rates in later developing umbels, while removal of tertiary umbels resulted in decreased abortion rates in both earlier and later formed umbels. These responses indicated that delayed abortion of developing seeds may be common in secondary umbels, that removal of secondary umbels by herbivores may relieve plants of some costs of abortion, and that S. arctopoides uses flexible allocation to achieve full compensation at typical levels of floral herbivory.

AB We measured aboveground biomass allocation of Pinus ponderosa on hydrothermally altered andesite in montane and desert climates. Thus substrate was held constant while climate varied. Trees from montane climates had higher leaf mass per unit cross-sectional area of sapwood (functional conducting xylem) than trees from desert climates, suggesting that a functional response to differences in climate had occurred. Our results also indicate that sapwood mass:leaf mass ratios of P. ponderosa may increase approximate to 50% with a 5 degrees C change in mean growing-season temperature, approximately the difference between our montane and desert sites. High proportional allocation of biomass to sapwood may improve water relations of P. ponderosa, but because sapwood contains living parenchyma, respiratory costs may be high. Site-specific regression equations were used to calculate aboveground biomass allocation for simulated montane and desert trees with the same diameter at breast height, dbh. Simulated montane trees were 46-52% taller than desert trees, and montane trees 10 cm in dbh had twice the total aboveground mass of desert counterparts. Simulated 50-cm montane and desert trees were almost identical in total mass, even though the montane tree was 46% taller. The predicted proportion of biomass allocated to bole sapwood increased with size for both montane and desert models; however, the 50-cm desert model contained 8% more total sapwood mass than the taller montane model. Total biomass of branches was similar for paired models of all size classes; however, biomass of primary and secondary branches differed considerably. The 50-cm desert model had twice as much biomass in primary branches in comparison to the montane model, whereas the montane model had 3 times more biomass in secondary branches than the desert model. For 10-cm trees of the desert and montane models 29 and 33% of the biomass were leaves, respectively. In larger trees, leaf allocation decreased to 5 and 7% for desert and montane models, respectively. The effects of climate on biomass allocation, such as reported here, and corresponding changes in whole-plant assimilation rates must be incorporated into growth-response models used to predict future fluctuations in forest productivity due to global climate change.

AB The effect of mass-dependent predation on risk-sensitive foraging choices of small birds in two ecological contexts was examined using stochastic dynamic models. In the first context, nonmigratory foraging, predation risk dependent on the bird's body mass leads to risk-averse behavior in situations where risk-neutral behavior would otherwise be expected and generally reduces the amount of foraging and the level of reserves carried by foragers. In the second context, premigratory foraging, mass-dependent predation can lead to risk proneness during the buildup of reserves for migration. Risk proneness is favored if birds can reduce mass and hence reduce predation after migration, thereby giving them an advantage to rapid departure. Other advantages of early departure can also lead to premigratory risk proneness but require more specific ecological assumptions. The literature on risk sensitivity in amount of food reward suggests a connection between migration and risk proneness on negative energy budgets but more tests are needed before any conclusions can be drawn.

AB In order to understand the implications of changes in global CO2 concentrations and temperature for the growth and fitness of individual plants, performance must be investigated in relation to the performance of other plants within a population. In this study we examined patterns of recruitment, mortality, and size structure of monospecific stands in response to ambient (400 mu L/L) and elevated CO2 concentrations (700 mu L/L) across three temperature regimes; 18 degrees, 28 degrees, and 38 degrees C. We created experimental populations of two annual plants that differ in their photosynthetic pathway and water use patterns: Abutilon theophrasti (C-3) and Amaranthus retroflexus (C-4). The effects of CO2, temperature, and their interactions on population structure were complex and species dependent. For both species increasing temperature resulted in higher germination and faster initial growth rates. These initial temperature responses increased the intensity and role of competition in determining stand size and structure. Postemergence responses to elevated CO2 differed markedly between the two species. For Abutilon, the C-3 species, serf-thinning and the mean biomass of the survivors increased under elevated CO2. For Amaranthus, survivorship, but not growth, increased under elevated CO2 conditions. We attribute differences in response between species not only to photosynthetic pathway, but also to differences in the onset of competition mediated through differences in plant form and in resource uptake and deployment. The patterns of stand development in response to CO2 and temperature suggest that the effects of changing CO2 and temperature may be understood within mechanistically based models of resource use. Temperature regulates the rate of resource use and the onset of interference among plants, while CO2 functions both as a resource and a resource regulator. Although mortality was concentrated later in stand development for Abutilon than Amaranthus, overall patterns of stand size and structure were similar for both species; mortality and size inequalities increased with increasing temperature and CO2. Because size is often correlated with fecundity, an increase in size hierarchies in response to elevated CO2, in conjunction with a decrease in survivorship, may result in a smaller effective population size. Our ability to predict changes in effective population size due to changing size hierarchies alone, however, should also consider developmental shifts in response to elevated CO2 that may result in, as in this study, a decrease in the minimum size at the onset of flowering.

AB We examine a salt marsh host-parasitoid system, consisting of the planthopper per Prokelisia marginata and its egg parasitoid Anagrus delicatus, for evidence of stabilizing parasitoid behavior. We first determine if there is sufficient parasitoid aggregation to potentially stabilize the Prokelisia-Anagrus interaction, using methods that infer parasitoid behavior from the spatial pattern of parasitism. We then test a basic assumption implicit in theory, that the degree of parasitoid aggregation is invariant with respect to changes in overall host and parasitoid density, and through time. Our results suggest that Anagrus behavior should, in theory, exert a consistent stabilizing effect on Prokelisia-Anagrus dynamics.
   Using field experiments, and direct sampling of the spatial distribution of parasitoids, we then try to determine if parasitoid aggregation is in fact responsible for the heterogeneous pattern of parasitism observed in the field. The results of these studies indicate that there is insufficient parasitoid aggregation to account for this heterogeneity. Instead, factors such as the degree of tidal inundation, or the age of host eggs, may cause host patches to differ in their vulnerability to parasitoid attack.

AB Simple individual-based models of population dynamics and spatial patterns are developed using cellular automata theory. These models assume that individuals within a population are distributed in space and that important interactions among individuals take place over some predefined local scale. Local density dependence in the model produces dynamics that depend on the scale of the dispersal distance. When dispersal occurs over long distances, the population enters a stable limit cycle. However, when colonization is limited to the same local neighborhood where competition is taking place, the spatial and temporal patterns become chaotic. Habitat size also affects the dynamics. Chaotic dynamics become cyclical as habitat size decreased. These results illustrate how a wide array of complex dynamics can arise with simple spatially distributed models and that the resulting dynamics can depend on the habitat size.

Experimental chambers with reconstructed forest floor were placed in the held and destructively sampled after 7 and 14 wk. D. octaedra enhanced the shoot biomass of the grass Agropyron trachycaulum (Link) Malte (Poaceae) and increased the shoot-to-root ratio during early plant growth. Microbial biomass, basal respiration and respiratory quotient qCO(2) in L/F layer material were reduced by D. octaedra but increased in the H layer. The nutrient (NH4+, NO3-, PO43-) content in soil was also affected by D. octaedra but the effects were small. Effects of the earthworms on soil nutrient content were masked by the great variation in the data and by leaching of nutrients from experimental chambers.

AB Seed fate pathways were investigated for antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata), a common and economically important shrub, from fall 1988 to fall 1992 at the Whittell Forest and Wildlife Area in Little Valley, Washoe County, on the east slope of the Sierra Nevada in western Nevada. Rodents harvested bitterbrush seeds from late July to September, taking them either directly off the fruiting twigs or picking up fallen fruits from the ground surface and carrying from 63 to 80% of the seeds away intact from shrubs. Radioactively labelled bitterbrush seeds placed under four source shrubs were removed and scatter hoarded primarily by yellow pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus). Caches contained a mean of 4-11 seeds and were located within 25 m from the source shrubs. Cache depth and microhabitat selection were generally favorable for bitterbrush seedling establishment.
   Chipmunks and other rodents found many of the seed caches and either ate the seeds (53%) or recached them elsewhere. Chipmunks probably also carried some intact seeds to larders in hibernacula to use as a winter food source. In spring, > 99% of emerging seedlings occurred in clumps containing from 2 to 104 individuals. An estimated 5.3 and 8.5% of those seeds cached by rodents and 1.1 and 2.4% of the seeds produced by shrubs in 1990 and 1991 produced emergent seedlings the following spring. Seedling mortality rates during their 1st yr ranged from 78 to 92%. Grazing by rodents was the most important source of mortality during early spring, and most seedling deaths were caused by desiccation during summer. Despite considerable attrition of individuals within clumps, most mature ''shrubs'' consisted of two or more individuals.
   The seed fate pathway that resulted in the highest probability of seedling establishment at this study site was harvest, dispersal, and scatter hoarding by chipmunks, and subsequent neglect of those caches. Retrieval of cached seeds by chipmunks followed by redistribution of those seeds to neglected secondary caches also resulted in many seedlings. Modes of seed dispersal based solely on abiotic agents appear to be insufficient to account for significant recruitment of bitterbrush seedlings.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine the importance of cascading trophic interactions in a freshwater, benthic food chain and if the strength of the indirect interactions depends on the degree of specialization in the predator. The effects of predation by two benthivorous fishes, tench (Tinca tinca) and Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis), on benthic macroinvertebrates, epiphytic algae, and submerged macrophytes were studied in a field experiment, using cages (2 m x 3 m x 0.8 m) placed in a eutrophic pond in southern Sweden. Cages were assigned to four different treatments: fishless controls, tench, perch, and tench + perch. Core samples were taken to assess the density of benthic macroinvertebrates and submerged macrophytes, and artificial substrates were used to study the dynamics of periphyton.
    Nonmolluscan benthic macroinvertebrates were not greatly affected by the presence of fish, whereas predation by tench dramatically reduced the biomass of snails and bivalves. Tench had an indirect, positive effect on the biomass of periphyton through a reduction of grazing pressure by snails, whereas perch had no demonstrable direct effect on molluscs or indirect effect on periphyton. Further, in the cages with low snail and high periphytic biomass (tench and tench + perch cages), growth of the dominant submerged macrophyte (Elodea canadensis) was reduced, probably due to shading by periphyton.
   This experiment confirms that a predator can have profound effects on interactions in benthic food chains and that the strength of the indirect interactions is dependent on the strength of the direct interactions. The strong direct effect of tench on snails indirectly affected periphyton and submerged macrophytes, whereas perch had no direct effect on benthic macroinvertebrates and,

AB Foraging mode may influence an array of ecological and bioenergetic characteristics, several of which we compared between two snakes: sympatric sit-and-wait foraging sidewinders, Crotalus cerastes, and widely foraging coachwhips, Masticophis flagellum. During the majority of surface activity, the nocturnal C. cerastes were either coiled on or partially buried in the sand waiting to ambush mobile prey, whereas the diurnal M. flagellum cruised through the habitat searching for active and sedentary prey. Average duration of daily surface activity of C. cerastes ((X) over bar +/- 1 SE = 7.2 +/- 0.7 h/d) was nearly twice that of M. flagellum (3.9 +/- 0.9 h/d). Body temperatures (T-b's) of active M. flagellum (33.1 degrees +/- 0.1 degrees C) averaged higher, and were maintained within a narrower range, than those of active C. cerastes (25.3 degrees +/- 0.1 degrees C). Field metabolic rates (FMR, as CO2 production), measured with doubly labeled water, were significantly greater in M. flagellum (body mass = 124 +/- 12 g [(X) over bar +/- 1 SE]) than in C. cerastes(125 +/- 6 g) during the active season (mid-April to mid-October; 0.154 +/- 0.017 vs. 0.063 +/- 0.005 mL.g(-1).h(-1)), transition seasons (mid-March to mid-April, mid-October to mid-November; 0.058 +/- 0.009 vs. 0.028 +/- 0.002 mL.g(-1).h(-1)), and hibernation (mid-November to mid-March, 0.014 +/- 0.002 vs. 0.007 +/- 0.001 mL.g(-1).h(-1)). Masticophis flagellum also possessed significantly greater rates of water influx than C. cerastes during the active (19.7 +/- 2.9 vs. 7.6 +/- 1.1 mL.kg(-1).d(-1)) and transition seasons (7.1 +/- 1.8 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.5 mL.g(-1).d(-1)). Standard metabolic rates (SMR), measured at six T-b's (10 degrees-35 degrees C), of M. flagellum averaged 37 +/- 4% greater than SMR of C. cerastes. The monthly metabolic cost of SMR, calculated by integrating 24-h T-b profiles with temperature-dependent regression equations for SMR, averaged 62 +/- 4% greater for free-ranging M. flagellum than for C. cerastes. The difference between FMR and SMR is the energy allocated to activities and other energy-demanding functions such as digestion and represented 65 and 76%, respectively, of the yearly metabolic expenditure of C. cerastes and M. flagellum. Annually, M. flagellum spent 2.6 times the amount of energy on activity and other functions as did C. cerastes. Contributing to expenditures above SMR were digestion (19-43% of FMR) and movement (6-18% of FMR). Feeding rate (calculated from water influx) during the active season of M. flagellum (24.1 +/- 5.5 g.kg(-1).d(-1)) was more than twice that of C. cerastes(9.4 +/- 1.4 g.kg(-1).d(-1)). Over a full year, M. flagellum consumed 2.1 times as much assimilable energy as did C. cerastes, although both species gained similar energy profits (212 and 177 kJ/yr, respectively). The foraging strategy of the cryptic, ambushing C. cerastes balances low energy expenditure with low food intake, whereas widely foraging M. flagellum have greater expenditures but achieve greater energy consumption, as well.

AB We explored local variation in rate of plant succession by computing three contrasting measures of change for 10 New Jersey old fields through the first 18 yr after abandonment. We found that all three measures, euclidean distance in ordination space, turnover analysis, and regression analysis of species loss from the initial cohort, showed the same trend of decrease in the rate of plant succession with time. However, we did not find a monotonic decrease, and the specific years of transient increase differed with the analytical measure used. Both turnover and regression analysis showed that those old fields that had previously been planted in orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata) had a much lower initial change than fields previously in soybeans, or soybeans and sorghum, but this difference dissolved after 10 yr of succession. The study fields compared favorably to other mesic successions and agreed with the general pattern of more rapid rate decrease in mesic compared to xeric successions. Our results echo the general decrease in the rate of plant succession with time reported in the literature and also show important relationships between this decrease and the land-use history of particular fields.

AB We examined the changes in leaf phenolic chemistry and insect herbivory from saplings of two temperate deciduous species, Liriodendron tulipifera (tulip poplar) and Cornus florida (dogwood), planted in five microenvironments in Gilmer County, Georgia, USA. The experimental design permitted comparisons between saplings grown in an open field, under shade cloth within the field, on the edge between field and forest, in forest understory, and within canopy gaps established within the forest. Half of the trees in each microenvironment were fertilized. Leaves from each tree were sampled at the end of the growing season in 1989 and 1990 and analyzed for toughness, percent dry mass, total phenolics, hydrolyzable tannins, condensed tannins, and insect herbivory (percent leaf area damaged).
   The shade-tolerant dogwood saplings contained higher levels of total phenolics and hydrolyzable tannins than the shade-intolerant tulip poplar saplings. Dogwood generally had lower levels of herbivory. These results support earlier studies suggesting that slow-growing, shade-tolerant species tend to have higher levels of phenolics and experience lower levels of herbivory than fast growing, shade-intolerant species. However, dogwood leaves contained lower levels of condensed tannins and were as tough as tulip poplar leaves.
   Sunlight availability had a significant positive influence on levels of phenolics in both species. Leaf phenolics generally increased with greater insolation from forest to field and when sunlight was greater within field or forest habitats. However, the levels of tannins in dogwood saplings only dropped significantly in the deep shade of the forest. The similar levels of dogwood phenolics in most microenvironments are indicative of the relatively high photosynthetic efficiency of this species in reduced light environments. Overall, these results are consistent with carbon/nutrient balance theory that predicts trade-offs in the allocation of photosynthate from defense to growth as light declines.
   Levels of insect herbivory and total phenolics were inversely related for dogwood. However, the relationship with tannins was less apparent. Herbivory on tulip poplar was unrelated to changes in phenolics, possibly reflecting the greater chemical diversity of that species. Fertilization increased the biomass of both species, but had no apparent influence on levels of leaf phenolics or insect herbivory. The lack of a fertilization effect was unexpected in light of previous suggestions that fertilization results in reduced phenolics and increased herbivory.

AB Many spatial models of ecological processes achieve analytical tractability by neglecting variability among individuals, in their patterns of movement, and among locations, in their favorability for colonization or persistence. We develop a series of simulations, based on standard metapopulation and partial differential equation models, that explicitly track variability among individuals or locations, and compare the results with what would be obtained by ignoring such variability. We find, first, that variability among patches can have a strong influence on the outcome of community dynamics, by promoting the coexistence of species that would otherwise exclude one or the other through competition. Second, variability among individuals in their rates of movement can markedly increase the rate of spread of a population. Construction and analysis of a modified PDE (partial differential equation) model for a population that consists of two classes of individuals, dispersers and nondispersers, confirms the second result, and also shows that the presence of even a few rapidly dispersing individuals can markedly increase the rate of spread of the population. Our simulations and analysis show that the incorporation of variability into ecological thinking is feasible and that it can strengthen our ability to investigate the effects of spatial processes.

AB Determining the strengths of interactions among species in natural communities presents a major challenge to ecology. Using an approach combining experimental perturbations and path analysis, I examined the mechanisms by which birds directly and indirectly affected other members of an intertidal community, evaluated alternative causal hypotheses, and predicted whether interactions among other unmanipulated species would be strong or weak. Comparing treatments with t tests indicated that excluding bird predators with cages caused increases in Pollicipes polymerus, and declines in Nucella spp., Mytilus californianus, and Semibalanus cariosus. However, these conclusions provided no insight into the underlying mechanisms causing the differences. Path analysis permitted insight into the causal mechanisms by making a variety of predictions about the strength of direct interactions: (a) Bird predation negatively affects Pollicipes, but not Nucella, Leptasterias, or Mytilus; (b) Pollicipes reduces Semibalanus and Mytilus abundance because of space competition; (c) Mytilus reduces Semibalanus cover through competition for space; and (d) as prey species, Semibalanus and Pollicipes enhance Nucella density, but Nucella predation does not have important effects on Semibalanus or Pollicipes. Based on the estimated strength of direct interactions, the importance of indirect effects among species could also be predicted. In experiments manipulating Nucella, Pollicipes, Semibalanus, and birds independently of one another, I tested 11 of the interactions predicted by the path analysis; all were supported. Path analysis in conjunction with limited experiments may provide an efficient means to predict important direct and indirect interactions among unmanipulated species within ecological communities.

AB The reproductive success of an individual plant is in part a function of its capacity to assimilate resources, and this in turn is partially a result of plant morphology. Simmondsia chinensis, jojoba, a dioecious desert shrub, is dimorphic in secondary sexual characters in some desert populations, where females on average have larger leaves and more open canopies than males. The function of this sexual dimorphism was examined by investigating the importance of shoot morphology to reproductive components of plant fitness. The reproductive behavior of individuals tended to be associated with different morphological attributes for both males and females. Males with more ''male-type'' morphology tended to have more inflorescences and a greater likelihood of flowering than did males structured more like females, though they also had smaller inflorescences. Females with more ''female-type'' construction produced more flower buds in one of the study years and also produced heavier seeds than females with more male-like structure. Females from four different morphological classes allocated 1.5-4.5 times as much to reproduction as did males, but showed wide variability in whether or not they set fruit. Therefore females either had a much higher or a much smaller reproductive allocation than most males. Fruit set in the population studied is not limited by pollen availability, but is presumably constrained by abiotic resource availability. The asymmetry between sexes in the morphology of reproductively more successful individuals points to a potential for a resource-based evolutionary origin of sexual dimorphism in jojoba, arising from different morphological optima for each sex.

AB Researchers have recently suggested that frequent prey dispersal into and out of an area can swamp the local effect of predation. Where prey are mobile, the extent of prey movement can therefore explain variation in the apparent effect of predators on local prey density. I compared the effect of the dominant predator in a temperate stream (brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis Mitchill) on five insect prey taxa (mayflies: Ephemeroptera), to test the prediction that the extent of density reduction should be less for prey taxa dispersing more frequently.
   The propensity of the mayflies to disperse by drifting downstream in the water column was measured in unmanipulated areas of the stream. Relative propensity to drift of the five mayflies was, from greatest to least: Baetis, Paraleptophlebia, Ephemerella, Eurylophella, Stenonema. I then tested effects of charr on the mayflies by manipulating charr density in fenced 35-m sections of the stream. Charr densities were adjusted to zero, medium, and high levels relative to natural densities. Rates of predation by charr in stream sections did not vary among the five mayfly taxa. Charr caused a large reduction in the density of Baetis, had a smaller effect on Paraleptophlebia, but had no detectable effect on the density of the other mayflies. Drift dispersal into the stream sections did not differ among charr densities. Effects of charr on prey densities could thus have been caused by direct predation or by increases in emigration from areas containing charr. Charr caused increased drift dispersal of Baetis and of Paraleptophlebia, but had no influence on drift of the other three mayflies. The reduction in density of Baetis by charr was due more to the charr-induced increase in drifting of Baetis than to direct predation on Baetis.
   The hypothesis that frequent prey dispersal swamps the effects of predators assumes that predators influence prey density primarily by consuming prey. In this system charr also influenced prey densities by causing increases in prey drift rates, affecting the mayflies that drifted most frequently. For this reason, the mayflies drifting less frequently were not, as predicted, the ones most strongly affected by charr. Variation in the effect of predators on prey density may thus be partially explained by both (1) changes in prey dispersal not related to predators, as proposed in the initial hypothesis, and (2) influences of predators on prey dispersal.

ID QUANTITATIVE GENETICS
AB Analysis of variance is one of the most commonly used statistical techniques among ecologists and evolutionary biologists. Because many ecological experiments involve random as well as fixed effects, the most appropriate analysis of variance model to use is often the mixed model. Consideration of effects in an analysis of variance as fixed or random is critical if correct tests are to be made and if correct inferences are to be drawn from these tests. A literature review was conducted to determine whether authors are generally aware of the differences between fixed and random effects and whether they are performing analyses consistent with their consideration. All articles (excluding Notes and Comments) in Ecology and Evolution for the years 1990 and 1991 were reviewed.
   In general, authors that stated that their model contained both fixed and random effects correctly analyzed it as a mixed model. There were two cases, however, where authors attempted to define fixed effects as random in order to justify broader generalizations about the effects. Most commonly (63% of articles using two-way or greater ANOVA), authors neglected to mention whether they were dealing with a completely fixed, random, or mixed model. In such instances, it was not clear if the author was aware of the distinction between fixed and random effects, and it was often difficult to ascertain from the article whether their analysis was consistent with their experimental methods. These findings suggest several statistical guidelines that should be followed. In particular, the inclusion of explicit consideration of effects as fixed or random and clear descriptions of F tests of interest would provide the reader with confidence that the author has performed the analysis correctly. In addition, such an explicit statement would clarify the limits of the inferences about significant effects.

AB The effect of the trace element selenium on black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) was studied in northern California. The role of selenium was evaluated by supplementing free-ranging adult females with selenium, measuring fawn production before weaning, and comparing to unsupplemented controls. Whole blood selenium levels (mode = 24 mug/kg) of unsupplemented animals were low, and 95% of free-ranging deer had inadequate levels according to livestock standards. There were no differences in whole blood selenium levels among sexes, ages, or seasons. However, there were significant differences between spring blood samples over the years. Selenium supplements increased preweaning fawn survival from 0.32 fawns/female to 0.83 fawns/female. The assumption that free-ranging wild ruminants are not normally susceptible to trace mineral deficiencies because adaptations to deficiencies occur over geological time was not supported.
