AB Climate variability has strong effects on marine ecosystems, with repercussions that range in scale from those that impact individuals to those that impact the entire food web. Climate-induced changes in the abundance of species in lower trophic levels can cascade up to apex predators by depressing vital rates. However, the characteristics and predictability of predator demographic responses remain largely unexplored. We investigated the detectability, limits, and nonlinearity of changes in Antarctic fur seal pup production at South Georgia over a 20-year period in response to environmental autocorrelation created by global climate perturbations; these were identified in time series of monthly averaged sea surface temperature (SST). Environmental autocorrelation at South Georgia was evident with frequent SST anomalies between 1990 and 1999, during a decade of warm background (time-averaged) conditions. SST anomalies were preceded by, and cross-correlated,with, frequent El Nino-La Nina events between 1987 and 1998, which was also a decade of warm background conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Nonlinear mixed-effects models indicated that positive anomalies at South Georgia explained extreme reductions in Antarctic fur seal pup production over 20 years of study. Simulated environmental time series suggested that the effect of anomalies on Antarctic fur seals was only detectable within a narrow range of positive SST, regardless of the distribution, variance, and autocorrelation structure in SST; this explained the observed nonlinearity in responses in pup production, which were observed only under persistent high SST levels. Such anomalies at South Georgia were likely associated with low availability of prey, largely krill, which affected Antarctic fur seal females over time scales longer than their breeding cycle. Reductions in Antarctic fur seal pup production could thus be predicted in advance by the detection of large-scale anomalies, which appeared to be driven by trends in global climate perturbation.

ID ABUNDANCE
AB We propose a general framework for modeling anuran abundance using data collected from commonly used calling surveys. The data generated from calling surveys are indices of calling intensity (vocalization of males) that do not have a precise link to actual population size and are sensitive to factors that influence anuran behavior. We formulate a model for calling-index data in terms of the maximum potential calling index that could be observed at a site (the "latent abundance class"), given its underlying breeding population, and we focus attention on estimating the distribution of this latent abundance class. A critical consideration in estimating the latent structure is imperfect detection, which causes the observed abundance index to be less than or equal to the latent abundance class. We specify a multinomial sampling model for the observed abundance index that is conditional on the latent abundance class. Estimation of the latent abundance class distribution is based on the marginal likelihood of the index data, having integrated over the latent class distribution. We apply the proposed modeling framework to data collected as part of the North American Amphibian Monitoring Program (NAAMP).

AB The population dynamics of a one-predator-two-prey system were modeled. This model included the evolution of antipredator defense in the prey species and the optimal diet choice in the predator and was analyzed numerically using computer simulations. Results showed that defense evolution in the prey species tended to promote coexistence of the three species and, depending on parameters, reduced the amplitude of density fluctuations. Introducing optimal diet choice by the predator into the model also promoted coexistence and generally reduced density fluctuations. When the additive genetic variance for defense intensity was large (i.e., the evolutionary rate of defense was rapid), coexistence of the three species and stabilization of dynamics tended to be promoted. As a consequence, we concluded that (1) the evolution of antipredator defense can be an important factor in the persistence of a community, either with or without the optimal diet choice of predator; and (2) when population dynamics are combined with the evolutionary dynamics of trait development, the relative time scale of the two processes plays an important role in the stability of the system.

AB An increasing number of studies suggest that the variance around the mean of predictor variables is an important determinant of the structure of assemblages, but few have separated effects of mean from those of variance of predictor variables experimentally. We addressed these issues by examining the effects of limpets on algal recovery in littoral rock pools. An initial experiment indicated that algal cover was a negative accelerating function of density of limpets, although this effect was weak. Superimposed to this effect there was a clear trend of variability in algal cover among pools that decreased with increasing density of limpets. These results suggested that mean intensity and spatial variance of grazing could affect algal colonization both within and among pools. This proposition was tested with a novel experimental design in which the mean intensity and the spatial variance of grazing were manipulated in factorial combinations. The experiment was repeated twice to examine possible generalities of outcomes. In both runs spatial variance of grazing enhanced spatial variance in algal cover, although this effect occurred under weak intensity of grazing in the first run and in combination with strong intensity of grazing in the second run. In contrast, intensity and variability in grazing operated independently on mean algal cover, with strong intensity depressing colonization of algae and large variance increasing colonization consistently in time. By manipulating the mean intensity and the spatial variance of grazing simultaneously, we were able to explain spatial patterns in algal cover that would have been classified as unexplained variation otherwise. We suggest that this novel experimental design may be fruitful to understand spatially variable processes in a wide range of ecological systems.

AB Boreal mammals in the Great Basin have long been viewed as island-bound Pleistocene relicts because they occupy island-like patches of montane habitat separated by desert lowlands that presumably are impermeable to dispersal. Recent work, however, raised the possibility that dispersal among mountain ranges is an important process in the biogeography of boreal mammals in the Great Basin. We test this proposition using genetic variation in a representative species, the yellow-bellied marmot (Marinota flaviventris). A total of 332 marmots was sampled from 10 ranges and genotyped at six microsatellite loci. If the intervening desert lowlands are impermeable barriers to dispersal, then there should be no relationship between genetic distance and geographic distance among mountaintop populations, and genetic diversity should be diminished because gene flow would not be available to replace alleles lost over thousands of generations of isolation. Our results did not support these predictions. There was a strong correlation between genetic and geographic distance, demonstrating an isolation-by-distance pattern, and genetic diversity was high. Our results suggest that marmot populations in the Great Basin may be linked by dispersal, providing a mechanism to replenish genetic variation lost by drift. However, global climate change over the next several decades could make the desert lowlands more difficult to traverse, eventually transforming the boreal faunas of Great Basin mountaintops into the isolated relicts they were originally portrayed to be.

AB Recent advances in analytical methods and exploration of regional diversity patterns in greater depth than simple whole-fauna patterns may change our understanding of the determinants of latitudinal gradients in species richness. Using a comprehensive database on the geographical distributions of the large fauna of endemic shorefishes from the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP), we delineated latitudinal diversity gradients (LDGs) of species with different range sizes and assessed how the mid-domain effect, energy supply, environmental variability, and habitat availability predicted the various LDGs. We used statistical methods that account for spatial autocorrelation within each variable and consider collinearity among them. We found marked variation in LDGs among species with different range sizes: species with large ranges contributed the most to the convex form of the entire-fauna LDG while species with small ranges generated most deviations from that form. The mid-domain effect was the strongest determinant for the entire-fauna LDG, largely due to the strength of its effect on widespread species. Habitat variables were the best predictors for LDGs of small-range species but had no significant effects on the entire-fauna pattern. We found that any relationship between energy supply and LDGs likely is spurious and arises from statistical effects of (1) the marked spatial autocorrelation of the residuals in those relationships and (2) strong covariation between energy supply and the mid-domain effect, two factors that have never been analyzed together in marine studies (and seldom in terrestrial studies). There was no indication that environmental stability was an important LDG determinant at any level within the fauna. We found that latitudinal (Rapoport) trends in range size in this fauna arise as corollaries of the mid-domain effect. The disparate contributions of species with different range sizes to diversity patterns demonstrate the failure of traditional, whole-fauna LDGs to adequately represent all faunal components and their determinants, particularly those of small-range (and more threatened) species. We argue that, just as analyses of whole-fauna patterns within a region obscure variation in determinants among faunal components, analyses of patterns at transoceanic (multiregional) scales are likely to conceal important regional variation in determinants of diversity gradients.

AB Forest-floor detrital food webs are sustained by annual inputs of leaf fall. However, it is unknown whether this bottom-up effect extends to vertebrates feeding on the detrital food web. We hypothesized that reproductive success of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus L.) is a function of macroinvertebrate biomass within the detrital food web, and that both macroinvertebrate biomass and Ovenbird reproduction can be predicted from forest productivity (measured by site index). We found that across diverse topography within two physiographic provinces of the central Appalachian Mountains macroinvertebrate biomass is correlated with forest site index. Furthermore, Ovenbird reproduction is a significant, Positive function of both site index and macroinvertebrate biomass. We conclude that bottom-up effects of forest productivity propagate though the detrital food web to secondary/ tertiary vertebrate predators. Thus site productivity is an effective tool for predicting landscape-scale variation in avian productivity and the strength of bottom-up effects within the forest food web.

AB To understand omnivore function in food webs, we must know the contributions of resources from different trophic levels and how resource use changes through space and time. We investigated the spatial and temporal dynamics of pine (Pinus ponderosa) food webs that included the omnivorous ant, Formica podzolica, using direct observation and stable isotopes. Formica podzolica is a predator of herbivorous and predatory arthropods, and a mutualist with some aphids. Observations in 2001 of foragers showed that in early summer (June) ants fed upon equal parts non-mutualist herbivores (31% prey biomass), mutualist aphids (27%), and predators (42%); ant trophic position was thus between that of primary and secondary predator (trophic level = 3.4). In late summer (September), ant feeding remained relatively constant upon non-mutualist herbivores (53%) and mutualist aphids (43%), but ant feeding upon predators fell (4%), thus shifting ant trophic position to that of a primary predator (trophic level = 3.0). Feeding on honeydew increased from 25% of ants in early summer to 55% in late summer. By increasing the frequency of their interactions with mutualist aphids, ants maintained a constant supply of arthropod prey through the summer, despite a two-thirds decline in arthropod biomass in pine canopies. Stable isotope analysis (delta N-15, delta C-13) of six pine food webs dispersed over 150 ha placed ant trophic level at 3.3 for early summer in 2002. There was significant variation among these trees in ant trophic position (range 3.2-3.6), but no indication of positive spatial autocorrelation. The combined results from this work shows that, across two years, F. podzolica fed, on average, at or slightly above the trophic position of primary predator, but trophic positioning varied both temporally and spatially by similar to 0.4 trophic levels.

AB Lianas (woody vines) are an important component of lowland tropical forests. We report large liana and tree inventory and dynamics data from Amazonia over periods of up to 24 years, making this the longest geographically extensive study of liana ecology to date. We use these results to address basic questions about the ecology of large lianas in mature forests and their interactions with trees. In one intensively studied site we find that large lianas (>= 10 cm diameter) represent < 5% of liana stems, but 80% of biomass of well-lit upper canopy lianas. Across sites, large lianas and large trees are both most successful in terms of structural importance in richer soil forests, but large liana success may be controlled more by the availability of large tree supports rather than directly by soil conditions. Long-term annual turnover rates of large lianas are 5-8%, three times those of trees. Lianas are implicated in large tree mortality: liana-infested large trees are three times more likely to die than liana-free large trees, and large lianas are involved in the death of at least 30% of tree basal area. Thus large lianas are a much more dynamic component of Amazon forests than are canopy trees, and they play a much more significant functional role than their structural contribution suggests.

AB Although many indices estimate diversity, species richness recently has been used as a surrogate for diversity in many studies in ecology, biogeography, and conservation. Underlying assumptions of this approach are that all diversity indices, including those that weight species importance by their relative abundance (e.g., evenness), are correlated positively, and that richness accounts for a large proportion of the variance in diversity. We addressed these assumptions with data from six grassland sites using univariate and multivariate analyses of a variety of indices (species evenness, richness, rarity, dominance, and Simpson's diversity index). Univariate correlations between plant species evenness and richness were weak and negative at each site. Principal-component analyses consistently revealed two significant components of variation in diversity. Richness and evenness were largely orthogonal, with Simpson's diversity loading between them. Thus, measures of species diversity based on relative abundance, as well as richness, may be necessary to capture the full complexity of diversity in conservation studies and in experiments of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. At these and perhaps other sites, species richness was an incomplete surrogate for diversity.

AB Models of host handling decisions and physiologically structured host-parasitoid population dynamics make diverging assumptions, untested as of this writing, about the allocation rules of nutrients to survival and reproduction. Our aim is to develop a data-rich multidimensional dynamical budget of nutrient acquisition and allocation in survival and reproduction in the host-feeding, synovigenic bruchid ectoparasitoid Eupelmus vuilletti (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae) over the entire lifetime of the animal in order to address the above questions.
   We quantified sugar, glycogen, protein, and lipid reserves of single females at birth and death and their daily maintenance needs. We recorded each host-feeding and oviposition event over entire lifetimes and quantified the amounts acquired and invested in eggs using microcolorimetric techniques. We then built two nutrient budgets, with and without hosts, encompassing 20 measured biochemical parameters and tested their predictions using time of death.
   Carbohydrate reserves are burned at a high rate for maintenance and can be used to predict lifetime in absence of hosts. The model without hosts is adequate, but the one with hosts is not, as it predicts a continuous increase of proteins from the massive host-feeding intake, contrasting with the observed decline. A good prediction of time of death could be achieved in that model by assuming that the large amounts of ingested proteins and carbohydrates from host-feeding are used for maintenance, thereby enabling females to spare lipids for reproduction. We tested this assumption in a treatment with hosts and supplemental sugars, in which the maximal number of produced eggs is expected to be almost exclusively a function of lipids when other nutrients can be obtained to cover maintenance costs.
   Our results enable us to discriminate between competing hypotheses about nutrient allocation in models. of parasitoid behavior and host-parasitoid population dynamics. They show that E. vuilletti is both a capital breeder for lipids and an income breeder for sugars, implying that this dichotomy is best superseded by a multidimensional and dynamical approach to nutrient acquisition and allocation.

AB Nonselective, density-independent mortality (DIM) is commonly thought to reduce the importance of competition, promoting coexistence of ecologically similar species. Yet, recent theory suggests that competition intensity and niche differences remain important under high DIM, even when competitive dominance is modified. Productivity is also thought to interact with DIM, potentially enhancing species coexistence. I explored these issues using a laboratory system composed of a diverse assemblage of bacteria as prey, and four species of competing protozoan bacterivores. Productivity manipulations were crossed with varying levels of DIM imposed on the bacterivores (in both polyculture and monoculture). DIM altered patterns of competitive dominance. At low DIM, Paramecium aurelia and Paramecium caudatum dominated, while Colpoda inflata (a species absent at low DIM) was able to invade and dominate at high DIM. Productivity did not promote shifts in dominance and hindered Colpoda performance. Examination of competition effect sizes provided clear evidence of competitive reversals and the importance of competition under low and high DIM. Variable competitive outcomes appeared to be mediated by changes in the strength of apparent competition effects on bacterial diversity, in accordance with theory. Bacterial diversity was low at low levels of DIM, due to strong consumer effects. High DIM weakened consumer effects and increased bacterial diversity, likely facilitating invasion and coexistence.

AB Density-mediated and trait-mediated indirect interactions between species may have important roles in structuring ecological communities. Here we dissect their contributions to community stability in a model herbivore-natural enemy interaction consisting of two aphid species (Acyrthosiphon pisum and Megoura viciae) and a specialist parasitoid (Aphidius ervi) that attacks only one of the aphids (A. pisum). In replicated cage experiments, we found that the two aphid species alone were unable to coexist, with A. pisunt competitively excluding M. viciae. We also found that the simple host-parasitoid interaction between A. pisum and the parasitoid was unstable. However, the three-species community persisted for at least 50 weeks. We constructed a series of models to explain the stability of the full community and conclude that it is due to a combination of density-mediated and trait-mediated indirect interactions. Parasitoid attack on the susceptible host reduces the interspecific competition experienced by the non-host (a density-mediated effect), and the presence of the non-host reduces the searching efficiency of the parasitoid (a trait-mediated effect).

AB Stable isotopes are increasingly used in animal ecology, but little attention has been paid to the underlying physiological processes accounting for changes in N-15/N-14 and C-11/C-12 ratios, for example, the influence of protein balance on delta 15N values. We investigated a "professional" faster, the King Penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), to test the effect of long-term food deprivation on the isotopic signature of tissues that can be nondestructively sampled, i.e., blood and feathers. Fasting for 25 days induced a tissue N-15 enrichment, thus leading to a moderate increase in the apparent trophic levels of penguins. As expected, N-15 enrichment was higher in tissues with high protein turnover rates (e.g., plasma, 0.70 parts per thousand than in those with low turnover rates (e.g., blood cells, 0.24 parts per thousand. Fasting decreased the delta(13)C value of plasma, which was due to an increase in its lipid content, as indicated by a concomitant rise in plasma C/N ratio. Finally, food deprivation induced a N-15 enrichment in keratin (1.68 parts per thousand), as indicated by the lower nitrogen signature for portions of new feathers that were synthesized at sea than for those parts grown on land, thus illustrating the different pathways for resource allocation (dietary vs. endogenous reserves) in molting birds. The study also emphasized the usefulness of collecting whole blood (or blood cells) in the field to overcome both the fasting and lipid effects observed in plasma.

AB It has become clear that long-distance seed dispersal plays a crucial role in plant metapopulation persistence and response to rapid climate change. Recent studies of the role of convective vs. shear-generated updrafts in prompting long-distance dispersal using Taraxacum officinale as an example, suggest that (1) the probability of abscission is independent of horizontal speed and thus (2) shear-induced vertical turbulence is low, and so by default the bulk of updrafts must be due to convection, especially in open habitats such as grasslands. In this paper, I directly test the first hypothesis, and indirectly test the second via a modeling exercise. Employing shorter averaging times than used previously, it is shown that abscission in T. officinale is controlled by horizontal wind speed. Indeed, it is related to the square of the wind speed, as might be expected if drag is the motive force. I also show that this augmentation of wind speed by the abscission bias should sufficiently increase the shear-induced turbulence so that shear rivals convection as a source of updrafts in open habitats. In conclusion, long-distance dispersal by wind will not be successfully modeled until we couple the abscission and subsequent dispersal processes.

AB Spatial heterogeneity of vegetation types and the abiotic environment can influence the occurrence and spread of wildfires, but in some landscapes the importance of these effects varies under conditions of severe fire weather. In the northern Patagonian landscape of forests and shrublands. we examined the effects of vegetation type (tall forest vs. tall shrubland) and abiotic factors (elevation, topography, and precipitation) on fire occurrence at a broad scale and on fire spread at a fine scale. We used satellite images (1985-1999) and aerial photography (1950-1999) to map fires in relation to pre-burn vegetation type and abiotic factors. Fire extent is greatest at intermediate elevations and locations of intermediate precipitation. Fire extent is limited by lack of fuel quantity at the lower end of the precipitation gradient and by infrequent or insufficient fuel desiccation at the upper end. Tall shrublands are proportionally more affected by fire than are adjacent mesic forests of Nothofagus dombeyi and N. pumilio. Patches of subalpine forests often tend to serve as natural fire breaks, except under the most severe tire weather. Tall shrublands are dominated by species that resprout vigorously so that fuels quickly recover. In contrast, forests are dominated by species dependent on seed reproduction that sometimes fails after severe fires so that shrublands tend to replace burned forests. The greater propensity of shrublands to burn is a positive feedback that is favorable to fire and that accelerates the replacement of forest by shrublands. Infrequently occurring severe weather is important in the burning of otherwise relatively fire-resistant subalpine forests. Past burning, associated both with drought and early forest clearing, expanded shrublands at the expense of forests so that in the modern landscape an increase in anthropogenic ignitions and the positive feedback of fire and shrublands are synergistically accelerating conversion from forest to shrubland.

AB There have been few attempts to generate global models of climate-richness relationships, and fewer still that aim to predict richness rather than fitting a model to data. One such model, grounded on theory (biological relativity to water-energy dynamics) is the interim general model (IGM1) of the climatic potential for woody plant richness. Here we present a second-generation model (IGM2), and genus and family versions of both models. IGM1 describes horizontal climate-richness relationships based on climate station data and systematic species range maps, with IGM2 additionally incorporating vertical changes in climate due to topographic relief. The IGMs are mathematical transformations of empirical relationships obtained for the southern subcontinent of Africa, whereby the re-described regression models apply to the full range of global variation in all independent climate parameters. We undertake preliminary validation of the new IGMs, first by mapping the distribution and relative spatial variation in forecasted richness (per 25 000 km(2)) across the continent of Africa, then by evaluating the precision of forecasted values (actual vs. predicted) for an independent study system, the woody plants of Kenya. We also compare the IGMs with a recent example of purely statistical regression models of climate-richness relationships; namely, the "global" model of A. P. Francis and D. J. Currie for angiosperm family richness. We conclude that the IGMs are globally applicable and can provide a fundamental baseline for systematically estimating differences in (woody) plant richness and for exploring the hierarchy of subordinate relationships that should also contribute to differences in realized richness (mostly at more discrete scales of analysis). Further, we found that the model of Francis and Currie is useful for predicting angiosperm richness in Africa, on a conditional basis (somewhere, sometime); we examined the relationship that it describes between climate and richness. Lastly, we found that indices of available soil water used in "water-budget" or "water-balance" analyses are not proxies for available liquid water as a function of climatological dynamics.

AB Tasty plants can be protected from herbivores by unpalatable neighbors. We used experimental exclosures, removal of unpalatable species, and transplants of palatable and unpalatable species in subalpine meadows of the Caucasus Mountains of Georgia to study the effects of two unpalatable species on plant communities. We found that Cirsium obalatum and Veratrum lobelianum, two large native perennial herbs that invade after heavy,grazing, had strong facilitative effects on communities through their indirect effects on livestock herbivores. These unpalatable invaders had different effects on community composition when livestock were present than when livestock were excluded. Furthermore, removing Cirsium and Veratrum where herbivory was permitted decreased the richness of associated communities, but inside a livestock exclosure removal of these species increased community richness. Transplanted palatable species (Anthoxanthum odoratum and Phleum alpinum) grew larger inside the exclosure, and in the exclosure Cirsium and Veratrunt had no effect on their growth. However, outside of the exclosure, Cirsium and Veratrum had strong positive effects on the growth of A. odoratum and P. alpinum. Excluding livestock decreased the growth of Luzula pseudosudetica, another unpalatable species, and Cirsium and Veratrunt had no effect on L. pseudosudetica outside the exclosure. In contrast, inside exclosures Cirsium and Veratrum had competitive effects on L. pseudosudetica. Our results indicate that Cirsium and Veratrum, which are in some ways undesirable rangeland weeds, may also play an important role in maintaining species and functional diversity of overgrazed plant communities in the Caucasus.

AB The usual statistical tests of trend are inappropriate for demonstrating the absence of trend. This is because failure to reject the null hypothesis of no trend does not prove that null hypothesis. The appropriate statistical method is based on an equivalence test. The null hypothesis is that the trend is not zero, i.e., outside an a priori specified equivalence region defining trends that are considered to be negligible. This null hypothesis can be tested with two one-sided tests. A proposed equivalence region for trends in population size is a log-linear regression slope of (-0.0346, 0.0346). This corresponds to a half-life or doubling time of 20 years for population size. A less conservative region is (-0.0693, 0.0693), which corresponds to a halving or doubling time of 10 years. The approach is illustrated with data on four amphibian populations; one provides significant evidence of no trend.

This hypothesis was tested using data from ponds in Michigan, USA, a freshwater mesocosm experiment, a synthesis of studies from diverse systems (cultures, lakes, streams, and marine and terrestrial environments), and simple dynamic models of producer growth and nutrient content. Unlike prior laboratory studies, the N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton in Michigan ponds clustered around and below the Redfield ratio (7.2:1 by mass), despite wide variation in N:P supply ratios (2:1-63:1 by mass) and the presence of grazers. In a mesocosm experiment, the N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton cells again deviated from a nearly 1:1 relationship with N:P supply. Phytoplankton seston exhibited lower N:P content than expected at high N:P supply ratios, and often higher N:P content than anticipated at low N:P supply ratios, regardless of herbivore presence. Similar deviations consistently occur in the N:P stoichiometry of algae and plants in the other diverse systems. The models predicted that both high loss rates (sinking, grazing) and physiological limits to nutrient storage capacity could attenuate producer stoichiometry. In the future, research should evaluate how limits to elemental plasticity of producers can influence the role of stoichiometry in structuring communities and ecosystem processes.

AB Research in pollination biology has focused on the interactions between animals and the flowers they visit for food reward. However, other selective agents, including predators, seed feeders, and herbivores, may affect pollination systems. Because flowers are predictable food sources for a variety of species, flowers are also reliable sites at which predators can locate flower-visiting animals. Prominent among pollinators' predators are beewolves (Philanthus spp.), common sphecid wasps (Sphecidae) that prey almost exclusively on bees. My fieldwork over three years indicates first, that an area of similar to 50 km(2) surrounding a single bumble bee wolf (Philanthus bicinctus) aggregation had a low bumble bee (Bombus spp.) density caused by intense predation by the wasps, and second, that fruit-set of the bumble bee-pollinated western monkshood (Aconitum. columbianum) was significantly lower at locations and times of bumble bee wolf activity than at control locations and times with no such predatory activity. These results indicate that predation can sometimes alter plant-pollinator interactions.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation have led to a widespread increase in the proportion of edge habitat in the landscape. Disturbance-dependent bird species are widely assumed to benefit from these edges. However, anthropogenic edges may concentrate nest predators while retaining habitat cues that birds use to select breeding habitat. This may lead birds to mistakenly select dangerous habitat-a phenomenon known as an "ecological trap." We experimentally demonstrated how habitat shape, and thus amount of edge, can adversely affect nest site selection and reproductive success of a disturbance-dependent bird species, the Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea). We did so within a landscape-scale experiment composed of equal-area habitat patches that differed in their amount of edge. Indigo Buntings preferentially selected edgy patches, which contained 50% more edge than more compact rectangular patches. Further, buntings fledged significantly fewer young per pair in edgy patches than in rectangular patches. These results provide the first experimental evidence that edges can function as ecological traps.

AB Uncertainties regarding the relationships between leaf and root. traits have impeded an integrated understanding of plant evolution and the efficient parameterization of ecosystem models. We measured key root and leaf traits of grasses from 77 sites in four grassland regions of the world (New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, North America). Within each region, the relationships among leaf traits paralleled those among root traits. Plants with low root or leaf N concentrations had roots or leaves with high tissue density, high lignin concentrations, low amount of mass that was soluble in a neutral detergent solution, large diameter/thickness, and were less enriched in N-15. Yet, whether comparing plants within a region or among all four regions, there was little relationship between root traits and leaf traits, except for a positive relationship between root and leaf N concentration and between root and leaf delta(15)N. At the global scale, factors such as soil freezing and the type of nutrient limitation appear to determine relationships among leaves and roots. C-4 grasses not only had lower leaf N concentrations than C-3 grasses but also lower root N concentrations. When compared at the same root N concentration, C-4 grasses had greater leaf N concentrations than C-3 grasses.

AB For decades ecologists have recognized the potential importance of marine-derived nutrients (MDN) deposited in freshwater ecosystems by spawning anadromous salmon. Previous studies have shown that some MDN are retained in freshwater ecosystems. A popular hypothesis linking MDN to salmon population productivity posits that MDN provided by post-spawning mortality of salmon are critical for salmon population dynamics because they enhance prey populations in the freshwater ecosystems used as nursery habitats. We tested this hypothesis by reconstructing historical sockeye salmon populations for the last 300 years in Bristol Bay, Alaska. Stable nitrogen isotope chronologies in lake sediments and sockeye catch and escapement histories show that commercial fisheries intercepted about two-thirds of MDN bound for freshwater spawning grounds since about 1900. Reconstruction of lake algal production using, fossil pigments shows that this loss of MDN has reduced lake algal productivity to about one-third of its level before commercial fishing. However, contrary to expectation, recent sockeye population sizes (sum of spawning escapement and fishery catch) in the last century were equivalent to those before the advent of commercial fishing. These data demonstrate that the MDN subsidy is important for the productivity of coastal lakes but that some sockeye salmon populations are limited by other features of ecosystems such as the amount of suitable spawning habitat.

AB Disturbances such as fire, insect outbreaks, and blowdown are important in shaping subalpine forests in the Rocky Mountains, but quantitative studies of their interactions are rare. We investigated the combined effects of past disturbances, current vegetation, and topography on spatial variability of the severity of a tire that burned approximately 4500 ha of subalpine forest during the extreme drought of 2002 in northwestern Colorado. Ordinal logistic regression was used to spatially model fire severity in relation to late 1800s fires, a 1940s spruce beetle outbreak, forest cover type, stand structure, and topography. The late 1800s fires reduced the probability of burning in 2002, and the 1940s beetle outbreak slightly increased the probability of fire, particularly at high severity. Aspen (Populus tremuloides) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands, which established after the late 1800s fires, were less likely to burn, whereas Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii)-subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) stands were more likely to burn. The highest elevations (>= 3100 m) had the lowest probability of burning, whereas intermediate elevations (2900-3100 m) had an increased probability of burning at high severity. The influences of the late 1800s fires and 1940s beetle outbreak on stand structure and forest cover type may be more important than their direct effects on fuels. The most important predictors determining fire severity were stand structure, forest cover type, the late 1800s fires, and elevation. Although, in other studies, the effects of pre-burn stand conditions and topography declined with increasingly severe fire Weather, in the case of the 2002 fire in Colorado, these predictors explained 42% of the variability of fire severity. Thus, these results suggest that pre-burn stand conditions are important influences on burn severity even for fires burning during extreme drought.

AB Although accumulating evidence indicates that local intraspecific density-dependent effects are not as rare in species-rich communities as previously suspected, there are still very few detailed and systematic neighborhood analyses of species-rich communities. Here, we provide such an analysis with the overall goal of quantifying the relative importance of inter- and intraspecific interaction strength in a primary, lowland dipterocarp forest located at Danum, Sabah, Malaysia. Using data on 10 abundant overstory dipterocarp species from two 4-ha permanent plots, we evaluated the effects of neighbors on the absolute growth rate of focal trees (from 1986 to 1996) over increasing neighborhood radii (from 1 to 20 m) with multiple regressions. Only trees 10 cm to < 100 cm girth at breast height in 1986 were considered as focal trees. Among neighborhood models with one neighbor term, models including only conspecific larger trees performed best in five out of 10 species. Negative effects of conspecific larger neighbors were most apparent in large overstory species such as those of the genus Shorea. However, neighborhood models with separate terms and radii for heterospecific and conspecific neighbors accounted for more variability in absolute growth rates than did neighborhood models with one neighbor term. The conspecific term was significant for nine out of 10 species. Moreover, in five out of 10 species, trees without conspecific neighbors had significantly higher absolute growth rates than trees with conspecific neighbors. Averaged over the 10 species, trees without conspecific neighbors grew 32.4 cm(2) in basal area from 1986 to 1996, whereas trees with conspecific neighbors only grew 14.7 cm(2) in basal area, although there was no difference in initial basal area between trees in the two groups. Averaged across the six species of the genus Shorea, negative effects of conspecific larger trees were significantly stronger than for heterospecific larger neighbors. Thus, high local densities within neighborhoods of 20 m may lead to strong intraspecific negative and, hence, density-dependent, effects even in species rich communities with low overall densities at larger spatial scales. We conjecture that the strength of conspecific effects may be correlated with the degree of host specificity of ectomycorrhizae.

AB Marine mesograzers use individual seaweeds as both habitat and food. Previobs studies by M. E. Hay, J. E. Duffy, and others have shown that mesograzers can acquire enemy-free space by inhabiting and consuming seaweeds that are chemically defended against larger, more mobile consumers. However, their studies, carried out in North Carolina and two tropical regions, consider only a small number of mesograzer species and focus primarily on fishes, even though some other large consumers can destroy mesograzers' host seaweeds. We asked, whether the previous findings could be generalized to (1) mesograzers at the community level, (2) large consumers other than fishes, and (3) a different ecosystem in another region, namely, diverse temperate rocky reef communities in Australia and New Zealand. Results from both Australasian regions were similar. In multiple-choice feeding assays larger grazers (three fishes, four gastropods, and three sea urchins) varied in breadth of preferences, but most often preferred to eat green algae of the family Ulvales and the red alga Pterocladiella capillacea, all of which were restricted to the intertidal zone. Most of the mesograzers surveyed (seven amphipods, three isopods, a gastropod, and a sea urchin) preferred to eat the seaweed species from which they were collected, many of which were either inaccessible or less palatable to many larger grazers. This difference in mesograzer vs. larger grazer feeding preferences was consistent with the findings of Hay and Duffy et al. However, community-level patterns of mesograzer distribution and abundance were not consistent with the extensions of the theory developed here. Seaweeds that were less palatable to the larger grazers did not tend to support more mesograzer individuals, mesograzer species, or specialist mesograzers (for either the entire mesograzer assemblage or just for sedentary mesograzers), but the evenness of entire mesograzer assemblages was significantly higher on seaweeds that were less palatable to larger grazers. We argue that spatial refuges on Australasian rocky reefs and differences in the biology of both the seaweed and animal species in Australasia vs. previously studied. locations enable palatable seaweeds to persist in the face of herbivory by larger grazers, which reduces the selective pressure on mesograzers to inhabit unpalatable species.

AB Adaptations and, counteradaptations are common in coevolving predatorprey systems, but little is known of the role of maternal transfer of adaptive traits in mediating species interactions. Here, we focused on tolerance against cyanobacterial toxins and asked whether this tolerance was an induced defense developed during Daphnia's lifetime, whether it was a trait that is constantly expressed, and whether such tolerance to the toxin can be transferred to the next generation through maternal effects. These questions were addressed by feeding a single clone of Daphnia magna a diet with and without algal toxin and recording changes in fitness (as intrinsic rate of population increase). Analysis of F1, F2, and F3 generations revealed that the increased tolerance to toxic Microcystis was an inducible defense developed during an individual's lifetime, and that this trait could be transferred from mother to offspring. This maternal effect was expressed in several fitness parameters, including shorter time to maturity and first reproduction, and higher numbers of offspring compared to inexperienced individuals. In some circumstances, such maternal effects may increase population production by up to 40% and may help to stabilize material and energy transfer to higher trophic levels.

AB Spatial gradients in density dependence and cyclieity are familiar features of the population dynamics of small mammals, particularly Fennoscandian rodents. The most well-documented of such gradients is a weakening of direct density dependence and an increase in the tendency of populations to cycle the farther north they occur, a phenomenon that has been attributed to gradients in predation and seasonality. Among large mammals, however, for which evidence of cyclicity is less clear, geographic gradients in population dynamics are limited to spatial variation in the strength of density independence. The population dynamics of caribou and muskoxen in Greenland, for example, display latitudinal gradients in the response of populations to large-scale climatic fluctuation. To my knowledge, the existence of spatial gradients in density dependence has not been explicitly investigated in large mammals. Here I present an analysis of the dynamics of 27 populations of caribou and reindeer in Greenland, Finland, and Russia, spanning 21 degrees of latitude (51.7 degrees-72.7 degrees N) and 215 degrees of longitude (56.4 degrees W-159.5 degrees E), to identify spatial gradients in density dependence and independence.
   Results of autoregressive time series analysis show a clear gradient in the strength of direct density dependence exhibited by these populations that declines from southern to northern latitudes. Although this pattern mirrors the latitudinal gradient evident in Fennoscandian rodent dynamics, an analysis of the dimensionality of these time series suggests that few, if any, of the populations are limited by predators. The existence of an inverse latitudinal gradient in the magnitude of the influence of large-scale climate on the dynamics of these populations suggests there may be a tension in the strength of density-dependent vs. density-independent limitation experienced by them.

AB It has been long established that the richness of vascular plant species and many animal taxa decreases with increasing latitude, a pattern that very generally follows declines in actual and potential evapotranspiration, solar radiation, temperature, and thus, total productivity. Using county-level data on vascular plants from the United States (3000 counties in the conterminous 48 states), we used the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to evaluate competing models predicting native and nonnative plant species density (number of species per square kilometer in a county) from various combinations of biotic variables (e.g., native bird species density, vegetation carbon, normalized difference vegetation index), environmental/topographic variables (elevation, variation in elevation, the number of land cover classes in the county; radiation, mean precipitation, actual evapotranspiration, and potential evapotranspiration), and human variables (human population density, crop-land, and percentage of disturbed lands in a county). We found no evidence of a latitudinal gradient for the density of native plant species and a significant, slightly positive latitudinal gradient for the density of nonnative plant species. We found stronger evidence of a significant, positive productivity gradient (vegetation carbon) for the density of native plant species and nonnative plant species. We found much stronger significant relationships when biotic, environmental/topographic, and human variables were used to predict native plant species density and nonnative plant species density. Biotic variables generally had far greater influence in multivariate models than human or environmental/topographic variables. Later, we found that the best, single, positive predictor of the density of nonnative plant species in a county was the density of native plant species in a county. While further study is needed, it may be that, while humans facilitate the initial establishment invasions of nonnative plant species, the spread and subsequent distributions of nonnative species are controlled largely by biotic and environmental factors.

AB Evidence is accumulating that winter habitats occupied by migratory birds produce differences in individual condition that can carry over into subsequent stages of the annual cycle. Despite strong observational evidence, experimental work is needed to strengthen support for this hypothesis. We experimentally upgraded individual American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) from low-quality second-growth scrub habitat to high-quality mangrove forest habitat by permanently removing behaviorally dominant, primarily adult males from mangrove, allowing females and immature males from scrub to colonize vacated territories. Prior to the manipulation, upgraded and control redstarts had stable-carbon isotope values in their blood indicative of scrub habitat occupancy and were comparable in body mass. Relative to control birds that overwintered exclusively in scrub, upgraded redstarts incorporated mangrove isotopic signatures, maintained body mass from winter to spring, departed earlier on spring migration, and returned at a higher rate in the following winter. Furthermore, insect biomass on upgrade territories was significantly greater than on control territories, suggesting food availability as a proximate mechanism underlying gradients of nonbreeding habitat suitability. Findings here demonstrate that winter habitat occupancy can be an important determinant of individual performance in migratory birds. Restricted access to food-rich winter habitats may limit survival of females and immature males, an outcome that could be an important driver of population structure and dynamics.

AB Error propagation is the calculation of statistical error in a quantity that comprises multiple components each with associated error. Such quantities constitute the end point of many ecological studies, but composite errors are rarely incorporated so that uncertainty in the final estimate is either unknown or underestimated. In this study we present the use of both parametric (observations are resampled from standard probability distributions) and nonparametric (raw observations are resampled) bootstrap techniques to propagate errors through the many steps involved in the egg-ratio estimation of seasonal production for the freshwater zooplankter Bythotrephes longimanus. We first compute parametric and nonparametric bootstrap estimates of the standard deviation in seasonal production of B. longimanus, showing that it ranges from 21% to 27% of observed seasonal production. We demonstrate that our bootstrapping procedures are robust by developing a theoretical model and showing that the true variance of a parameter is included in 96% of the simulated 95% confidence intervals. We also show that the choice of probability distribution in the parametric bootstrap can change the standard deviation of seasonal production by up to 90%. We argue that ecologists should use such error propagation techniques more routinely than is currently the case.

AB The relationship between metabolic rate and body mass follows a power function: B proportional to m(b) where B is the basal metabolic rate, in is the species mass, and b is the allometric exponent. Older models based on a consideration of surface to volume ratios predict an exponent b = 2/3, whereas more recent models based on efficient transport and fractal design predict an exponent b = 3/4. We analyzed 22 published allometric exponents to address the following questions: (1) Is the published allometric exponent correlated with number of species, average mass, or range of mass in the study? (2) What is the mean and confidence interval for published exponents, and do they vary among taxa? (3) Given the published exponent data, what is the likelihood that b = 2/3 vs. 3/4? We found that published exponents were not correlated with sample size, average mass, or log(difference in mass). For mammals and birds, the allometric exponents were tightly clustered, with means of 0.72 and 0.73, respectively. The reptile data spanned a wider range but had a mean of 0.74. Likelihood analysis suggests that b = 3/4 is significantly more probable than b = 2/3. We built a linear regression simulation with experimental error in mass and showed that such measurement error systematically lowers estimates of the allometric exponent. Measurement error probably contributes to the observation that published allometric exponents often fall short of b = 3/4 as predicted by theoretical models.

AB Arctic and alpine habitats are extreme environments characterized by short breeding seasons, cold temperatures, limited food availability, and potentially high predation rates. Stringent ecological conditions are likely to have important consequences for the evolution of life history traits, but direct empirical tests are few. We compare the demography of three populations of ptarmigan on an environmental gradient spanning alpine, subalpine, and arctic habitats. Female Willow Ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) and White-tailed Ptarmigan (L. leucurus) breeding at subalpine and alpine sites had smaller clutches and lower probabilities of nesting success, fledging success, and renesting than Willow Ptarmigan nesting at a low-elevation arctic site. Annual fecundity, measured as female fledglings per breeding female, did not overlap among the three populations and was ranked: alpine (0.40 +/- 0.08, mean +/- SE, 95% CI = 0.26-0.58) < subalpine (1.33 +/- 0.10, 1.13-1.54) < arctic (2.04 +/- 0.18, 1.68-2.39). There was a nonsignificant trend for apparent survival rates (phi) of breeding females to vary in the opposite direction: alpine (0.46 +/- 0.04) > subalpine (0.43 +/- 0.03) > arctic (0.37 +/- 0.06). Population growth rates predicted significant declines for the alpine population (lambda = 0.65 +/- 0.07, 95% CI = 0.52-0.79), but not the subalpine (lambda = 1.00 +/- 0.07, 0.86-1.14) or arctic populations (lambda = 1.13 +/- 0.20, 0.78-1.54). The adjusted estimates of survival necessary to sustain a stationary population indicated that actual variation in female survival was more pronounced than the observed rates: alpine (0.71) > subalpine (0.43) > arctic (0.33). Together, the fecundity and survival values provide evidence that even congeneric populations can exhibit a continuum between high reproductive and survivor life history strategies. Variation in ptarmigan life history traits was consistent with population differences in predation rates on eggs and breeding females, and it was not related to duration of the breeding season, climatic conditions, or food availability. Ptarmigan demography also covaried with body size, but not in the predicted pattern. Overall, the life history strategies of ptarmigan are consistent with our current understanding of the impacts of environmental factors upon life history variation in passerine songbirds.

AB During the first six years of atmospheric CO2 enrichment at the Duke Forest free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment, an additional sink of 52 +/- 16 g C(.)m(-2). yr(-1) accumulated in the forest floor (O-horizon) of the elevated CO2 treatment relative to the ambient CO2 control in an aggrading loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forest near Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA. The experiment maintained an atmospheric CO2 concentration 200 mu L/L above ambient levels in replicated (n = 3) FACE rings throughout the six-year period. This CO2-induced C sink was associated with greater inputs of organic matter in litterfall and fine-root turnover. There was no evidence that microbial decomposition was altered by the elevated CO2 treatment. Consistent with ecosystem recovery following decades of intensive agriculture, the C and N content of the mineral soil increased under both the elevated CO2 treatment and the ambient CO2 control, during the six-year period. This increase is attributed to accumulation of plant residues derived from fine roots with relatively high turnover rates rather than accumulation of refractory or physically protected soil organic matter (SOM). The elevated CO2 treatment produced no detectable effect on the C and N content of the bulk mineral soils or of any particulate organic matter size fraction. Because the fumigation gas was strongly depleted in C-13, the incorporation of new C could be traced within the ecosystem. Significant decreases in delta C-13 Of soil organic carbon (SOC) under the elevated CO2 treatment were used to estimate the mean residence times of intra-aggregate particulate organic matter and mineral-associated organic matter as well as the annual C inputs required to produce the observed changes in delta C-13. Our results indicate that forest soils such as these will not significantly mitigate anthropogenic C inputs to the atmosphere. The organic matter pools receiving large annual C inputs have short mean residence times, while those with slow turnover rates receive small annual inputs.

AB In this paper we introduce a method to analyze the inter- and intraspecies transmission rates and contact structure between susceptible and infected plants in epidemics in mixed plant populations. Using spatiotemporal maps of damping-off epidemics caused by Rhizoctonia solani in replicated microcosms of > 400 randomly mixed radish and mustard seedlings, we first show that as an epidemic progresses through a mixed plant population it changes the contact structure between infected (I) and susceptible (S) plants, so that resistant plants are challenged progressively more frequently, thereby slowing the epidemic. We estimate the transmission rates for each of the four S-I pair combinations. All transmission rates rose initially with time and then declined, with overall lower rates for the more resistant mustard species. However, the interspecies transmission rates were unexpectedly high. We show how these rates relate to relative changes in infectivity and susceptibility of each host species, and how a species that is weakly susceptible in a pure stand can still act as a strong donor of disease in a mixture, thereby lowering the efficacy of the mixture to reduce disease. We discuss the broader consequences for the dynamics of disease in natural and managed populations.

AB Although alternative stable states are commonly found in simple models, it seems reasonable to assume that the response of real ecosystems to environmental change should often be smoothed by spatial heterogeneity and other stabilizing mechanisms. Here, we systematically explore the effect of spatial heterogeneity on regime shifts for three different models, which we run on a one-dimensional lattice with different spatial distributions of an environmental factor (e.g., soil fertility, water level). If dispersion between patches is negligible, the response to gradual change in some overall stressor (e.g., precipitation, nutrient load) is straightforward. Because of the environmental heterogeneity, each patch shifts to the other stable state at different values of the overall control variable. Therefore, the response of the ecosystem as a whole is gradual (i.e., the average of many asynchronous small shifts) instead of catastrophic. However, in response to a reverse change in the global stressor, the system always shows hysteresis, as each individual patch shifts back to the original state at a different value of the control parameter than the critical threshold for the forward shift. If dispersion between patches occurs, the response to change in the overall control parameter becomes dependent on the spatial pattern of environmental heterogeneity. If the environmental parameter is randomly distributed in space, the overall response tends to remain surprisingly catastrophic, and hysteresis is hardly reduced as compared to the homogeneous case. By contrast, in a smooth environmental gradient, the response of the overall system is gradual, and hysteresis is much smaller. In fact, hysteresis is largely reduced to the initial phases, in which none of the patches have shifted to the alternative state yet. As soon as the first patch shifts, a domino effect occurs, pushing over the neighboring patches. In conclusion, our results suggest that spatial heterogeneity may weaken the tendency for large-scale catastrophic regime shifts if dispersion is unimportant or if local environmental characteristics vary along a smooth gradient.

AB The response of plants to temperature has gained renewed interest as researchers speculate on the biotic response to climate change. It is of particular interest in the Arctic, due to recent warming trends and anticipated continued warming for the region. This long-term, multispecies study confirms that changes in temperature affect the functioning of plants in their natural environment. It also demonstrates that the influence of temperature should be considered in the context of natural variability within a given location. The study examined natural temperature gradients, interannual climate variation, and experimental warming at sites near Barrow (71 degrees 18' N, 156 degrees 40' W) and Atqasuk (70 degrees 29' N, 157 degrees 25' W) in northern Alaska, USA. At each of the four sites, 24 plots were experimentally warmed for 5-7 years with small, open-top chambers, and plant growth and phenology were monitored; an equal number of unmanipulated control plots were monitored. The response of seven traits from 32 plant species occurring in at least one site is reported when there were at least three years of recordings. Plants responded to temperature in 49% of the measured traits of a species in a site. The most common response to warming was earlier phenological development and increased growth and reproductive effort. However, the total response of a species, for all traits examined, was individualistic and varied among sites. In 14% of the documented responses, the plant trait was correlated with thawing degree-day totals from snowmelt (TDDsm), and temperature was considered the dominant factor. In 35% of the documented responses, the plant trait responded to warming, but the interannual variation in the trait was not correlated with TDDsm and temperature was considered subordinate to other factors. The abundance of temperature responses that were considered subordinate to other factors suggests that prediction of plant response to temperature that does not account for natural variability may overestimate the importance of temperature and lead to unrealistic projections of the rate of vegetation change due to climate warming.

AB The extinction of small populations is a stochastic process, affected by both environmental variation and chance variation in the fates of individuals (demographic stochasticity). Here I examine how population extinction risk is affected by variation in the underlying individual phenotypes, using a branching-process approach. I define the long-term individual extinction risk as the chance of ultimately leaving no descendants, and the cumulative individual extinction risk as the chance of leaving no descendants by a specified time. I use these to show that if there is a phenotypic correlation between parents and their offspring, variation in these quantities always reduces both the long- and short-term population extinction risk. Such variation in individual extinction risk arises from individual variation in demographic parameters and may have both genetic and environmental causes. Using a well-known approximation of the difference between the log arithmetic and log geometric means, I derive expressions for the sensitivity and elasticity of the approximate log extinction risk to changes in the mean and variance of the individual extinction risk, and, to changes in population size. One conclusion is that increasing the variance among individuals in extinction risk can sometimes be at least as important in reducing population extinction risk as increasing,the population size itself. These analyses also point to reasons why changes in environmental factors (e.g., toxicants) or management practices may have either larger or smaller effects than would be anticipated by considering the change in the mean risk alone.

AB Although competition between plants is nearly universal in vegetation, we know relatively little about belowground competition and how it interacts with aboveground competition in tropical forests, and almost nothing about such interactions on soils of intermediate fertility in sites with a moderate dry season, despite the fact that such forests are extensive. We investigated this over one year in a Panamanian tropical semi-evergreen rain forest, using tree seedlings (Simarouba amara, Gustavia superba, Tachigali versicolor, and Aspidosperma cruenta; least to most shade tolerant), experimental gaps, and trenching. Gaps increased growth and decreased mortality; growth increases were: Simarouba 684% (increase in height relative growth rate), Gustavia 411%, Aspidosperma 364%, and Tachigali 324%. Trenching in gaps increased growth in three species (Simarouba 49%, Gustavia 63%, and Aspidosperma 38%) but had very small effects in the understory; trenching did not affect mortality. We infer that trenching caused increased growth due to increased nutrients in the wet season, and increased water and/or nutrients in the dry season. Thus, across the tropics, in all but the wettest sites with fertile soils, seedlings of many species will be limited by belowground competition, at least in gaps. This is similar to the pervasive importance of belowground competition in temperate forests.

AB Negative effects of habitat fragmentation are thought to be diminished when habitat patches are joined by a corridor. A key assumption is that corridors facilitate exchange rates of organisms between otherwise isolated patches. If the organisms are pollinators, corridors may be important for maintaining genetically viable populations of the plants that they pollinate. We tested the hypothesis that corridors increase the movement of insect pollinators into patches of habitat and thereby increase pollen transfer for two species of plants, one pollinated by butterflies (Lantana camara) and the other by bees and wasps (Rudbeckia hirta). We worked in an experimental landscape consisting of 40 >= 1-ha patches of early-successional habitat in a matrix of forest. Within each of eight experimental units, two patches were connected by a corridor (150 x 25 m), and three were not. Patch shape varied to control for the area added by the presence of a corridor. Differences in patch shape also allowed us to test alternative hypotheses of how corridors might function. The Traditional Corridor Hypothesis posits that corridors increase immigration and emigration by functioning as movement conduits between patches. The Drift Fence Hypothesis posits that corridors function by "capturing" organisms dispersing through the matrix, redirecting them into associated habitat patches. Using fluorescent powder to track pollen, we found that pollen transfer by butterflies between patches connected by a corridor was significantly higher than between unconnected patches (all values mean +/- 1 SE: 59% +/- 9.2% vs. 25% +/- 5.2% of flowers receiving pollen). Likewise, pollen transfer by bees and wasps was significantly higher between connected patches than between unconnected patches (30% +/- 4.2% vs. 14.5% +/- 2.2%). These results support the Traditional Corridor Hypothesis. There was little support, however, for the Drift Fence Hypothesis. To generalize our results to a larger scale, we measured the probability of pollen transfer by butterflies as a function of distance along a 2000 x 75 m corridor. Pollen transfer probability exponentially declined with respect to distance and successfully predicted pollen transfer probability on the scale of our previous experiment. These results suggest that corridors facilitate pollen transfer in fragmented landscapes.

AB We conducted a meta-analysis of previously published empirical studies that have examined the effects of nitrogen (N) enrichment on litter decomposition. Our objective was to provide a synthesis of existing data that comprehensively and quantitatively evaluates how environmental and experimental factors interact with N additions to influence litter mass loss. Nitrogen enrichment, when averaged across all studies, had no statistically significant effect on litter decay. However, we observed significant effects of fertilization rate, site-specific ambient N-deposition level, and litter quality. Litter decomposition was inhibited by N additions when fertilization rates were 2-20. times the anthropogenic N-deposition level, when ambient N deposition was 5-10 kg N(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1), or when litter quality was low (typically high-lignin litters). Decomposition was stimulated at field sites exposed to low ambient N deposition (<5 kg N(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1)) and for high-quality (low-lignin) litters. Fertilizer type, litterbag mesh size, and climate did not influence the litter decay response to N additions.

   CONSEQUENCES
AB High-density aggregations of conspecifics have long been presumed to have negative effects on individual fitness, yet this has not been adequately tested for multiple life history traits in the field. Here I report a series of investigations that comprehensively evaluate the influence of conspecific density on key traits (survival, growth, and reproduction) in the intertidal barnacle Balanus glandula. Density was manipulated in mid-intertidal barnacle populations living on both natural rock surfaces and on settlement plates, and monitored in natural populations. Survival was positively related to density: populations at the lowest density level were 19 times more likely to experience >= 95% mortality than those at the highest level. In contrast, growth and individual reproductive output were negatively related to density: animals at lower experimental densities (16-50, adult barnacles/100 cm(2)) grew to 1.6 times the diameter of individuals living at higher densities (200-460 adult barnacles/100 cm(2)), and larger barnacles produced larger brood masses than smaller individuals. Overall, the frequency of brooding barnacles in experimental and natural populations was greatest at intermediate densities. Estimation of the basic reproductive rate for the experimental animals on the settlement plates indicated that the primary effect of increased conspecific density was enhanced survival, and consequently, a larger mean number of larvae produced per original recruit. Thus in this case, the positive intraspecific effects of high-density aggregations outweighed the negative effects. My results demonstrate that key life history traits may not have similar responses to changes in density, and provide a strategy for evaluating the relative importance of positive vs. negative intraspecific interactions.

AB Seed dispersal often occurs in two or more discrete stages, but the effects of the latter stages of dispersal on successful recruitment have seldom been measured. We investigated the relative contributions of primary and secondary seed dispersal of Sierra bush chinquapin (Castanopsis sempervirens; Fagaceae) to seedling establishment. Rodents (mostly yellow pine chipmunks, Tamias amoenus) harvested chinquapin nuts rapidly during a three-week period starting in mid-August and scatterhoarded most nuts (81%) in the ground. Most initial (primary) caches contained one nut (range = 1-5 nuts) buried 10-23 mm deep within 46 m of source shrubs. Rodents subsequently retrieved 95% of these nuts and recached at least 33% elsewhere (secondary caches), at,lower densities and up to 64 m from source plants. By winter, 41% and 21% of nuts harvested from shrubs remained in scatter caches in 1999 and 2000, respectively. Only 10 caches (4 primary and 6 secondary caches) present in winter 1999 (7.8%), and no caches from winter 2000, produced seedlings the following spring. All seedlings died during the first growing season because of rodent grazing and desiccation.
   Despite low seedling survival in this study, chinquapin appears to be dependent upon scatterhoarding rodents for seedling recruitment. Secondary dispersal is an important aspect of chinquapin dispersal. Secondary caches contributed more to chinquapin seedling recruitment than primary caches; 2.5% of primary caches and 5.6% of secondary caches produced seedlings. This study suggests that, for propagules that move repeatedly during dispersal, a clear understanding of the dynamics of seed dispersal can be gained only by following seed movements, determining the transition probabilities between different stages of dispersal, and assessing the contribution of each stage of seed dispersal to plant recruitment.

AB Shallow lake ecosystems can shift between clear-water, macrophyte-rich conditions and turbid states with abundant phytoplankton. However, little is known about the controls of algal community composition and primary production before, during, and after ecosystem state change, because long time series that monitor biological change through the transition are scarce. Using proxy data sets derived from sediment cores from two shallow hypertrophic lakes in Denmark, variance-partitioning analysis (VPA) was used to determine the relative importance of changes in total phosphorus (diatom inferred), planktivorous fish density (zooplankton inferred), and submerged macrophyte communities (as macrofossil abundance) as determinants of algal abundance and community composition (as sedimentary pigments) over ecosystem state transitions since 1750 (CE) for Lake Lading and 1900 for Lake Sobygaard. Past variation in densities of planktivorous fish explained 12.3% and 18.2% of historical algal community change in lakes Lading and Sobygaard, respectively, while a further 22.3% and 6% of algal variability was explained by variation in macrophyte abundance. Total phosphorus (TP) alone explained nonsignificant amounts of variance (1.5%, 3.6%) but had a significant effect in combination with macrophytes and fish (27%, 13.4%). State transitions occurred ca. 1940 but were preceded by increases in benthic diatoms and macrophytes, suggesting that transitions were gradual rather than instantaneous. In contrast, green, colonial blue-green, and cryptophyte algae were abundant only during turbid states after ca. 1960 and were correlated to changes in planktivorous fish or fish-TP interactions. Contrary to expectations, the shift from predominantly benthic to pelagic algal production represented only a change in habitat and did not result in an increase in total abundance of primary producers.

AB Recent field experiments tested the hypothesis that variations in the aggressiveness of territorial cocks drive Red Grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) population cycles. The implications of these results were previously explored with parametrically flexible models that made specific assumptions about the functional form of direct density dependence and the form and timing of delayed density dependence. Although these models were characterized by apparently different stability conditions, they pointed at the same conclusion: that the occurrence of population cycles under this hypothesis relies on the strength of the interaction between, density and aggressiveness around the system's equilibrium. To investigate if this important result is valid more generally, we develop a minimally specified model by lifting most of the assumptions on direct and delayed density dependence. Stability analysis of this functionally flexible model confirms that unstable dynamics are indeed more likely if small perturbations from equilibrium density have a strong impact on aggressiveness, and it unifies the stability conditions previously derived for the more specific models under a single, general condition. Further, we derive global, necessary, and sufficient conditions for instability and express them in terms of proportional changes in aggressiveness and density. For the first time since the inception of the hypothesis, the necessary condition quantifies the minimum strength of the intrinsic mechanism that would be required to cause unstable dynamics. We predict that unstable population dynamics are possible if proportional perturbations from equilibrium density are at least matched by proportional changes in aggressiveness. Existing field data indicate that the necessary condition for intrinsic cycles is satisfied in Red Grouse populations. In contrast, the sufficient condition is considerably more strict, implying that intrinsic instability is not an inevitable feature of the system. We conclude that the model is consistent with the demographic patterns of cyclic population fluctuations in Red Grouse and other birds of the grouse family.

For example, predator-induced traits typically provide superior predator resistance but slower growth, while competitor-induced traits provide better growth but inferior predator resistance. While the mechanisms underlying predator resistance have been identified, the mechanisms underlying differential growth have remained elusive. To determine whether competitor and predator environments affect individual growth by induced changes in foraging morphology, we raised wood frog tadpoles (Rana sylvatica) under a factorial combination of competitors and predators and assessed changes in mouthparts that might affect growth. In general, competitors induced relatively larger oral discs, wider beaks, and longer tooth rows, while predators induced relatively smaller oral discs, narrower beaks, and shorter tooth rows. These effects were interactive; the largest competitor-induced responses occurred under high predator density and the largest predator-induced responses occurred under low competition. Further, one of the tooth rows that commonly appeared under low predation risk was frequently absent under high predation risk. These discoveries suggest that predator and competitor environments can have profound effects on prey foraging structures and that these effects set up growth trade-offs between phenotypes that favor the evolution of phenotypically plastic responses.

AB While small-scale studies show that more diverse native communities are less invasible by exotics, studies at large spatial scales often find positive correlations between native and exotic diversity. This large-scale pattern is thought to arise because landscapes with favorable conditions for native species also have favorable conditions for exotic species. From theory, we proposed an alternative hypothesis: the positive relationship at large scales is driven by spatial heterogeneity in species composition, which is driven by spatial heterogeneity in the environment. Landscapes with more spatial heterogeneity in the environment can sustain more native and more exotic species, leading to a positive correlation of native and exotic diversity at large scales. In a nested data set for grassland plants, we detected negative relationships between native and exotic diversity at small spatial scales and positive relationships at large spatial scales. Supporting our hypothesis, the positive relationships, between native and exotic diversity at large scales were driven by positive relationships between native and exotic beta diversity. Further, both native and exotic diversity were positively correlated with spatial heterogeneity in abiotic conditions (variance of soil depth, soil nitrogen, and aspect) but were uncorrelated with average abiotic conditions, supporting the spatial-heterogeneity hypothesis but not the favorable-conditions hypothesis.

AB Secondary succession reflects, at least in part, community assembly-the sequences of colonizations and extinctions. These processes in turn are expected to be sensitive to the size of the site undergoing assembly and its location relative to source pools. In this paper we describe patterns of succession over 18 years in an experimentally fragmented landscape created in eastern Kansas, USA, in 1984. The design of the experiment permits one to assess the influence of patch size and landscape position on successional dynamics. The general trajectory of succession follows that typical of succession in much of the eastern United States. In the initial years of the study, there was relatively little effect of patch size or distance to sources. Here we show that spatial effects in this system have become increasingly evident with time, as gauged both by repeated-measures ANOVA and ordination techniques. Woody plants have colonized more rapidly (per unit area) on large and nearby patches., Species richness at a local (within-quadrat) scale in general has increased, with slightly greater richness in large than in small patches later in the study. Temporal stability in community composition has generally been greater in large patches. Spatial heterogeneity in community composition has increased during succession, but with different patterns in large and small patches. This long-term experiment suggests that landscape structure influences many aspects of community structure and dynamics during succession, and that such effects become more pronounced with the passage of time.

AB The potential advantage of extreme value theory in modeling ecological disturbances is the central theme of this paper. The statistics of extremes have played only a very limited role in ecological modeling, despite the disproportionate influence of unusual disturbances on ecosystems. An overview of this theory is provided, with emphasis on recent developments that both make more efficient use of the available data on extremes and enable applications that are more ecologically realistic. Consistent with the emphasis on scale in ecology, scaling properties of extremes are emphasized. It is argued that the existence of distributions whose extreme upper tail is "heavy" (i.e., decreases at a relatively slow rate) implies that ecological disturbances are sometimes regarded as more "surprising" than they ought to be.
   The application focuses on modeling disturbances in paleoecology. Two examples are considered: the first, a sediment yield time series for Nicolay Lake in the high Arctic, reflects only the influence of hydrologic disturbances; the second, a sediment rate time series in the Chesapeake Bay, includes both climatic and anthropogenic influences. Strong evidence supports a heavy-tailed distribution for the Nicolay Lake sediment yield, but not necessarily for the Chesapeake Bay sediment rates. For each example, it is demonstrated how the statistics of extremes can readily incorporate information about covariates, such as large-scale atmospheric-oceanic circulation patterns or land use.

AB Predators (or parasites) can have both direct and indirect effects on prey (or host) demography. Recent theory suggests that the impact of either effect may be greater if predators and parasites skew the sex ratio of survivors. Brown-headed Cowbirds (Mol-othrus ater) are obligate brood parasites. Many studies have shown that adult cowbirds directly cause host offspring mortalities. Cowbird young may indirectly cause additional mortalities by increasing competition in the nest. The sex ratio of surviving host offspring will be skewed if one sex is a poorer competitor and thus more likely to die. We studied whether and how cowbird parasitism affects host offspring sex ratios in Song Sparrow (Melospiza melodia) nests. The proportion of female sparrows in parasitized nests (0.28 +/- 0.01) was half that in unparasitized nests (0.57 +/- 0.05) at six days post-hatch and at fledging (0.27 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.52 +/- 0.11). Consistent with their being at a competitive disadvantage, female sparrows were smaller and lighter than male sparrows in parasitized mixed-sex (both sexes present) nests. This indirect effect of cowbirds on the sex ratio of surviving host offspring may dramatically affect host demography. We suggest that predator- or parasite-mediated sex ratio biases could be important to the demography of many prey or host species.

AB Phoradendron hexastichum is a bird-dispersed mistletoe that infects the dioecious tree Cecropia schreberiana. Because both species share frugivore seed dispersers, we hypothesized that female Cecropia would have a greater probability and intensity of mistletoe infection than males due to more frequent visitation by shared frugivores. Over 50% of female Cecropia were infected, in contrast with 25% of males. On average, female trees had twice as many mistletoes as male trees. Infection probability and intensity increased with basal area in females but not in males, suggesting that lifetime reinfection was also female biased. We found mistletoe frugivores visiting uninfected fruiting females twice as often as males. Although mistletoes were mostly consumed by the mistletoe specialist Euphonia musica, we did not record Euphonia visiting uninfected Cecropia trees. Uninfected Cecropia trees were frequently visited by generalist frugivores (such as Spindalis portoricensis) that used both mistletoes and Cecropia fruits. The Cecroppia-frugivores-Phoradendron network of interactions seems to have led to the spatial linkage of the two plant species through directional dispersal, to plant-plant facilitation through shared frugivores. and to bird-bird facilitation in which generalist frugivores start new foci of infection that specialist frugivores can use.

AB There are two common approaches to food webs. On the one hand, empirical studies have described aggregate statistical measures of many-species food webs. On the other hand, theoretical studies have explored the dynamic properties of simple tri-trophic food chains (i.e., trophic modules). The question remains to what extent results based on simple modules are relevant for whole food webs. Here we bridge between these two independent research agendas by exploring the relative frequency of different trophic modules in the five most resolved food webs. While apparent competition and intraguild predation are overrepresented when compared to a suite of null models, the frequency of omnivory highly varies across communities. Inferences about the representation of modules may also depend on the null model used for statistical significance.

AB One hypothesis to explain the extensive variation in colony size seen in most taxa is that individuals sort themselves among groups based on phenotypic characteristics that correlate with their performance in groups of different sizes. We investigated how baseline levels of the steroid hormones, corticosterone and testosterone, were associated with choice of colony size and the likelihood of moving to a different site in later years in colonially nesting Cliff Swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) in southwestern Nebraska, USA, in 2000-2004. We sampled hormone levels of birds caught at colonies and, using mark-recapture, monitored their movement and choice of colony size through subsequent years in the study area. Maximum likelihood estimation and multistate model fitting (with program MARK) revealed that birds with baseline corticosterone levels above the average for the colony and time of sampling were less likely to choose a colony of the same size or larger in a later year than were birds with corticosterone levels below the average. This result held for Cliff Swallows in both fumigated (parasite-free) sites and colonies naturally infested with ectoparasites. Relative baseline corticosterone level was unrelated to the likelihood of movement between different colony sites, and corticosterone level measured after birds were held for 60 minutes was unrelated to either colony-size choice or the probability of movement. Males whose testosterone levels were above the average for the colony and time of sampling were more likely to choose a colony of the same size or larger in a later year than were ones whose testosterone levels were below the average, but the opposite pattern was found for females. The results indicate that steroid hormone level is a predictor of whether a Cliff Swallow will settle in a relatively small or large colony, and support the hypothesis that variation in colony size reflects, in part, a distribution of birds with inherently different neuroendocrinological characteristics.

AB The evolution of carnivory in plants is generally interpreted as an adaptation to colonize nutrient-poor environments. Because the photo synthetic costs associated with this habit are elevated, the selective advantages of carnivory should vary depending on the balance between light, moisture, and nutrient (prey) availability. Here we test whether the patterns of selection operating on the carnivorous habit of Pinguicula moranensis change among four populations located along an environmental gradient for soil nitrogen and prey availability, photosynthetically active radiation, and moisture, and whether or not these changes are in accordance, with adaptive expectations. We characterized the phenotypic variation,in two carnivory-related attributes (the densities of capture and digestive glands) and their relationship with the efficiency and the fitness benefit of prey capture along the environmental gradient. Finally, we compared the selective dynamics operating on the carnivorous habit along the environmental gradient by means of path analyses. Both the efficiency,and the benefit of carnivory varied among populations and peaked at,habitats characterized by a marked nutrient limitation and high levels of irradiance. We also found evidence of adaptive differentiation among populations. Natural selection favored the allocation to capture glands, in nitrogen-poor (soil or prey derived) environments, while investment in digestive glands was more advantageous in nitrogen-rich habitats. Carnivory was subject to a heterogeneous regime of selection along the environmental gradient that was tightly associated with both abiotic factors and prey availability.

AB We evaluated the roles of the abiotic environment and dispersal in the assembly of fern communities at contrasting spatial scales within an old-growth, temperate deciduous forest. Specifically, we examined correlations among the geographic location of sampling plots separated by either 135-3515 m (mesoscale) or 4-134 m (fine scale), the abiotic environmental characteristics of the plots, and their constituent fern species. Ferns had predictable distributions along a soil moisture gradient at both spatial scales: six of eight common fern species showed repeatable environmental optima along the soil moisture gradient. By sampling in such a way as to decouple the correlation between distance and environmental variation, we showed the dominant role of environmental variables such as soil moisture in determining fern distributions at the mesoscale. At the fine scale, however, strong spatial autocorrelation in the abiotic environment precluded assigning any definitive role for either dispersal or environmental determinism alone in affecting fern distributions. The expectations of neutral theory that are rooted in dispersal limitation and those of niche theory that are rooted. in environmental adaptation converge at fine spatial scales where natural environments have strong spatial structure. The structure of the environment at fine spatial scales may foster the persistence of dispersal-limited plants in the community; neighboring environments are likely to be similar, and thus suitable for propagules dispersing short distances. While patterns of fern distribution in this locality are not consistent with purely neutral or random models of species coexistence, alternative models that rely on strict niche requirements without accounting for dispersal effects and the inherent spatial structure of the environment are inadequate because they neglect the important interaction of these factors. This outcome supports the relevance of developing theory that considers the joint effects of environmental determinism and dispersal on the distribution and abundance of plant species.

AB The paradigm that net seaweed photosynthesis in the stressful intertidal zone decreases predictably with increasing tidal elevation has not been tested widely. We measured the variation in net photosynthesis rates of a common intertidal brown seaweed (Fucus gardneri) collected from 14 sites and two tidal heights on San Juan Island, Washington (USA) in water and air, in summer and winter. We also measured temperature, relative humidity, and thallus hydration in situ. Mean net photosynthesis in air was two orders of magnitude lower than in water, a greater mean difference than found among sites and between tidal elevations and seasons. Thalli never fully desiccated even in summer, and net photosynthesis was always positive. Rates in air and water varied little and nonsignificantly between tidal elevations and were not consistently lower at upper elevations, where in situ conditions were not always drier and hotter. Although photosynthetic rates per se did not vary predictably across the tidal gradient, mid-elevation thalli gained 25 times more carbon because they were exposed to air for shorter periods. Thalli experienced stressful conditions that reduce net photosynthesis during exposure, but the length of time exposed to air, rather than desiccation, determined daily photosynthetic carbon acquisition.

AB A distance-based method is provided for the analysis and modeling of multivariate community data in response to a nonlinear gradient. Any reasonable dissimilarity measure can be used, and the method provides a natural extension from canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) to nonlinear canonical analysis through the use of a link function, much like the extension of linear models to generalized linear models. The form of the nonlinear link function needs to be specified and will depend on the particular ecological system and the nature of the gradient. For example, an exponential decay curve could be used to model community structure after an environmental impact as a nonlinear function of time. This curve is used in our first example, where community structure is modeled as a nonlinear function of habitat size. Our second example uses a logistic curve to model change in community structure through a region of habitat transition from grassland to woodland. Computationally, this methodology uses a standard nonlinear optimization procedure to find the values of the parameters that maximize the correlation of the principal coordinates (obtained from an appropriately chosen distance measure) with the chosen form of nonlinear gradient. A simple randomization procedure is used to test the significance of the fitted nonlinear gradient over and above the fit of the linear gradient, and bootstrap confidence intervals for parameters are readily obtained. Any reasonable form of nonlinear gradient can be used, and it can be modeled as a nonlinear function of multiple environmental variables, making this a very flexible and versatile procedure for modeling multivariate ecological systems.

AB Palaeoecological studies are yielding fresh insights into slow forest ecosystem processes that are rarely observed using standard ecological methods, yet have major impacts on ecosystem function. Regional pollen data describe the broad features of the regional spread of trees but yield few insights into the processes of stand invasion and the facilitating role of disturbance. Pollen and charcoal data from small forest hollows are used to complement regional data in the study of the spread of Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica into southern Scandinavia during the last 4000 years. P. abies spread as a migrating front and preferentially invaded successional Betula stands, which had become particularly widespread in the region during the last 1000 years as a result of human activity. The spread of P. abies also closely tracked the changing area of suitable regional climate. The spread of F. sylvatica was more directly linked to anthropogenic activities and disturbance by fire prior to stand establishment. F. sylvatica preferentially invaded rich deciduous stand types that had declined in abundance during the last 2000 years. A recent range reduction of F. sylvatica can also be ascribed to human activity. The stand-scale palaeoecological data show how site conditions and disturbance are more important rate-limiting factors for F. sylvatica than for P. abies and help explain why F. sylvatica spread shows a patchy dynamic rather than the smoother migrating front of P. abies.

AB Theoretical models predict that the net outcome of biotic interactions among plants is the sum of co-occurring negative and positive interactions, with facilitation generally increasing in importance with increasing abiotic stress. However, species differ in fundamental niche optima; thus the intensity of stress is relative among species and important only in the context of these relative differences. We tested the hypothesis that the facilitative response of a species is relative to how much abiotic conditions deviate from the optimum conditions for that particular species (stress), and the competitive "response" ability of the species (i.e., its ability to tolerate the inhibitory effects of neighbors). In a field experiment, we examined the responses of three co-occurring species with different ecological optima, Bromus erectus, Brachypodium rupestre, and Arrhenatherum elatius, to the alleviation of a primary limiting resource (water), and to biotic interactions in a mesoxeric grassland in eastern France. We found that A. elatius had a strong positive response to watering, the response of B. rupestre was moderately positive, and B. erectus did not respond significantly, suggesting that water stress was only important for the first two species. Most importantly, the net outcome of the interaction between each species and its neighbors depended on the degree of water stress it experienced in its natural habitat. For survival, in the control plots we found no significant interactions for B. erectus (not stressed) whereas B. rupestre and A. elatius (stressed species) were facilitated. Enhancing water availability suppressed facilitation of B. rupestre and A. elatius and led to competitive exclusion of B. erectus. In contrast to survival, there was no facilitation for growth in the control plots, and competition intensity increased for all three species with watering. In our experiment the competitive response of a species was inverse to its ability to tolerate stress, indicating a trade-off between these components of the species response. A facilitative outcome appears to be a function of a species having both a low tolerance to a particular abiotic stress and a strong competitive-response ability.

AB Obligate pollination mutualisms have been central to our understanding of the ecology and evolution of mutualisms. Although usually viewed as pairwise interactions, obligate mutualists also interact with other community members that may impact the mutualism. In this study, we examined the community context of the obligate inutualism between the plant Yucca filamentosa and its yucca moth pollinator Tegeticula cassandra to determine the relationships among plant traits, the community assemblage, and fruit set. In addition to attracting its pollinator, Y. filamentosa in central Florida also attracts two insect florivores: the hemipteran Leptoglossus phyllopus and the beetle Hymenorus densus. We Surveyed flowering Y. filamentosa in 2001 and 2002 to determine the abundance of the three insect species throughout the flowering period. We also measured fruit set and four plant traits thought to be important in attracting the moth pollinator. Path analysis revealed that T. cassandra was the most important determinant of relative fruit set for both years. Peak pollinator abundance was significantly earlier than peak flowering. Consequently, we found a negative relationship between plant flowering date and pollinator abundance. Furthermore. taller plants also attracted more pollinators. Leptoglossus phyllopus had a significantly negative impact on relative fruit set in 2001 but not in 2002, whereas H. densus had no effect in either year. Abundance of the two florivores was more closely tied to peak flowering of Y. filamentosa than was the peak abundance of the pollinator moths. Although both florivore species reached high densities on Y. filamentosa, their effect on relative fruit set through floral abscission may be partially masked by the characteristically high abscission rates found in yuccas. As a result, florivores may be feeding on flowers that are already destined to be abscised. Similarly, pollinator moths may be preadapted to handle the effects of florivores because females lay eggs across multiple plants and flowers. Hence, the obligate mutualism between yuccas and yucca moths may be somewhat buffered from the effects of local community members depending on whether florivores substantially increase floral abscission rates from year to year.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have a variety of effects on foliar-feeding insects, with the majority of these being positive, although reports of negative and null effects also exist. Virtually all previous experiments have used mobile insects confined in cages and have studied the effects of one, or at most two, species of mycorrhizae on one species of insect. The purpose of this study was to introduce a greater level of realism into insect-mycorrhizal experiments, by studying the responses of different insect feeding guilds to a variety of AM fungi. We conducted two experiments involving three species of relatively immobile insects (a leaf-mining and two seed-feeding flies) reared in natural conditions on a host (Leucanthemum vulgare). In a field study, natural levels of AM colonization were reduced, while in a phytometer trial, we experimentally colonized host plants with all possible combinations of three known mycorrhizal associates of L. vulgare. In general, AM fungi increased the stature (height and leaf number) and nitrogen content of plants. However, these effects changed through the season and were,dependent on the identity of the fungi in the root system. AM fungi increased host acceptance of all three insects and larval performance of the leaf miner, but these effects were also season- and AM species-dependent. We suggest that the mycorrhizal effect on the performance of the leaf miner is due to fungal-induced changes in host-plant nitrogen content, detected by the adult fly. However, variability in the effect was apparent, because not all AM species increased plant N content. Meanwhile, positive effects of mycorrhizae were found on flower number and flower size, and these appeared to result in enhanced infestation levels by the seed-feeding insects. The results show that AM fungi exhibit ecological specificity, in that different. species have different effects on host-plant growth and chemistry and the performance of foliar-feeding insects. Future studies need to conduct experiments that use ecologically realistic combinations of plants and fungi and allow insects to be reared in natural conditions.

AB In short-lived species, fecundity strongly influences population size. For those species with multiple breeding attempts per breeding season, variance in fecundity is best explained by the number of breeding attempts. For birds, multiple brooding may be influenced by food availability. Here, we report results of a food supplementation experiment that tests the role of food as a mechanism driving variation among individuals in the frequency of multiple brooding in a Neotropical migrant songbird, the Black-throated Blue Warbler (Dendroica caerulescens). Supplementally fed females produced more second broods, spent less time foraging and more time loafing, and stayed closer to their nests than did control females. Fed and control females did not differ in the number or mass of young fledged from the first nesting attempt. Supplemental food increased the probability that females would initiate second broods in both a low and an average food year, suggesting that this population is food limited during the breeding season in most years. Our results thus demonstrate that food availability can strongly influence annual fecundity in migratory bird species breeding in temperate forests, which, in turn, affects annual recruitment rates and population size.

AB Although cyclic animal dynamics have long been a focus of scientific interest, the variable cycle lengths are poorly understood. Based on a review of the literature, we suggest that period length in animals showing multiannual cycles is related to the life span of their food plant rather than to any trait of the animal, such as mass or fecundity. We envisage that this pattern is brought about by a prolonged mobilization of induced defenses in longer lived plants, which can better afford periods of low reproductive output than can short-lived plants. On the basis of this hypothesis we expect animals with similar diets to show similar cycle lengths, irrespective of taxonomy and size. A path analysis, on the vertebrate herbivores, shows that 92% of the variation in cycle length is explained by food-plant longevity and that body mass adds little to this.

AB In generalized, multispecies mutualisms, competition among members of one guild can influence the net benefits that each species in the other guild receives. Hence seasonal factors that affect the dynamics of competition can also affect net benefits, especially if the benefit or cost of mutualism also varies seasonally. In the Sonoran Desert, two common species of generalist ants compete for access to extrafloral nectaries on the fishhook barrel cactus Ferocactus wislizeni, but their relative abundances vary seasonally; one ant dominates more cacti in winter/spring, and the other in summer/autumn. Recently, a third ant species, which also varies in abundance seasonally, has appeared at our study sites and is competing With resident ants for access to cactus nectaries. This empirical system motivated us to examine a metapopulation model of competition for patches in an open system with periodic forcing. We use the model to: (1) illustrate three ways in which competing species may differ in their sensitivities to environmental conditions that are consistent with seasonally displaced patterns of abundance; (2) ask under what conditions the invasion of a third competitor into a two-species system could alter the sensitivity of the system to environmental forcing at low vs. high frequency; and (3) show how differences among competitors in the pattern of seasonal forcing alone can dramatically alter the outcome of a competitor invasion. We discuss implications of these results for the ways in which seasonal variation among competing mutualists, and the benefits and costs of mutualism, may affect the functioning of generalized, facultative mutualisms.

AB Recent advances in spatial ecology have improved our understanding of the role of large-scale animal movements. However, an unsolved problem concerns the inherent stochasticity involved in many animal search displacements and its possible adaptive value. When animals have no information about where targets (i.e., resource patches, mates, etc.) are located, different random search strategies may provide different chances to find them. Assuming random-walk models as a necessary tool to understand how animals face such environmental uncertainty, we analyze the statistical differences between two random-walk models commonly used to fit animal movement data, the Levy walks and the correlated random walks, and we quantify their efficiencies (i.e., the number of targets found in relation to total displacement) within a random search context. Correlated random-walk properties (i.e., scale-finite correlations) may be interpreted as the by-product of locally scanning mechanisms. Levy walks, instead, have fundamental properties (i.e., super-diffusivity and scale invariance) that allow a higher efficiency in random search scenarios. Specific biological mechanisms related to how animals punctuate their movement with sudden reorientations in a random search would be sufficient to, sustain Levy walk properties. Furthermore, we investigate a new model (the Levy-modulated correlated random walk) that combines the properties of correlated and Levy walks. This model shows that Levy walk properties are robust to any behavioral mechanism providing short-range correlations in the walk.

AB Integrating how habitat heterogeneity influences food web dynamics is critical to enhance our understanding of community structure. This study quantified resident (invertebrates) and transient (juvenile and piscivorous fish) fauna within restored intertidal oyster reefs and analogous control sites without reef habitat in each of three habitats (on the edge of salt marsh away from seagrass, on mudflats isolated from vegetated structures, and in between seagrass and salt marsh habitat). Reefs enhanced the abundance of resident invertebrates (e.g., polychaetes, nemerteans, epibenthic anemones, bivalves, and resident decapods) that comprise > 90% of juvenile fish prey biomass. However, the increase in food availability due to reef presence did not affect abundance of juvenile fish in either of the vegetated habitats, suggesting that resources may not limit juvenile fish when restored in these habitats. Only mudflat reefs augmented juvenile fish abundances, most likely due to a combination of greater resource availability and relative isolation from functionally equivalent habitats. In addition, lower abundances of piscivorous fish in mudflat reefs relative to control areas likely contributed to this pattern. Thus, community structure and important ecosystem functions such as secondary production depend on the spatial configuration of surrounding habitats, in much the same way that species interactions can depend on their biotic and abiotic context.

AB Because fire season may influence how plant populations respond to fire, quantifying effects of different fire seasons may be essential for conservation of fire-dependent species. In this paper, we report results from a three-year study on the effects of replicated experimental burns in summer (wet) vs. winter (dry) seasons, on vital rates of Chamaecrista keyensis, a narrowly endemic understory perennial herb of pine rockland forests of the Lower Florida Keys. C. keyensis in the burned treatments had lower first- year survival than in unburned treatments, and plants in the summer-burn treatments had lower first-year postburn survival than those in the winter-burn treatments. These annual survival patterns, however, were reversed by the third year postfire, when plants in summer-burn plots had the highest survival. The number of plants lost due to winter, but not summer fires, was replenished to the control unburned population level by three years postburn. Fires, particularly summer fires, stimulated vegetative growth of C. keyensis. In addition, summer- and winter-burn treatments each stimulated C. keyensis fruit production when compared to unburned treatments. In general, plants that existed before the fires had greater annual survival and fruit production, but smaller vegetative growth, than plants that came into existence after the fires. These two cohorts of plants have nonetheless similar responses to the three fire treatments. The winter-burn treatments produced greater seedling recruitment than the summer-burn or control treatments over three years postburn. Slight differences in the timing of burns within the wet season caused large differences in the demographic responses of C. keyensis, suggesting that the definition of summer season vs. winter season might be too broad for management purposes. Overall, winter burns and early summer burns had advantages over late summer burns and no-burn treatments. This suggests that C. keyensis may have evolved under a fire regime that included lightning-caused early summer burns, as well as non-lightning winter burns.

AB Plant communities on nutrient-poor soils are thought to use nutrients more efficiently to produce biomass than plant communities on nutrient-rich soils. Yet, increased efficiency with declining soil nutrients has not been demonstrated empirically in lowland tropical rain forests, where plant growth is thought to be strongly limited by soil nutrients, especially phosphorus (P). We tested for higher P uptake and use efficiency across a 16-fold soil P gradient in lowland Borneo by measuring the P content of aboveground net primary productivity (fine litter production plus new tree growth; ANPP) for 24 months. Extractable soil P was positively related to litter production, tree growth, and ANPP. Efficiency of P response (ANPP/available soil P), uptake (P uptake/available soil P), and use (ANPP/P uptake) increased monotonically with declining soil P and was significantly higher on P-rich soil than P-poor soil. Increased P uptake and use efficiency with declining soil P enabled higher than expected plant productivity on low P soils and thus strongly influenced spatial patterns of aboveground productivity throughout this lowland landscape.
   A complementary P use efficiency index, the integrated canopy P (P-c) use efficiency of production (ANPP/P. X residence time of P-c), was similar across the P gradient, but underlying dynamics varied significantly with soil P: on rich soils, ANPP/P. was high and Pc residence time was low, while the converse held on poor soils. These contrasting strategies enabled rapid tree growth on nutrient-rich soils, where P limitation is relatively weak, and higher P conservation on nutrient-poor soils, where P limitation is relatively strong. The occurrence of contrasting P use strategies on high and low P soils has important implications for understanding spatial patterns of aboveground productivity, P cycling, and canopy tree species composition across the P gradient.

AB We have developed our recent demonstration that a temporal niche axis may support the stable coexistence of tree species. We previously applied a two-species lottery model assuming differences between species in environmental sensitivity to generate the predictions that the better competitor will show greater fluctuation in recruitment and be the less common species, predictions supported unanimously by data from a Mexican deciduous forest. Here, we expand on that model and explore the implication from our earlier study that competition among tree species may be focused, rather than the more commonly assumed diffuse, by applying a version of the model dealing with diffuse competition. We found focused competition to be the better explanation of the available data. Our results constitute a serious challenge to the entrenched opinion that competition among tree species is diffuse and to the proposition that competition may be unimportant in structuring tree communities. Another component of the earlier work was the comparison of closely related species. Although species may be ecologically similar for reasons other than phylogenetic relatedness, the additional underlying genetic similarity and the shared evolutionary history of close relatives makes them good candidates for the processes driving storage dynamics. We draw on the Gentry data set to show that congeneric species co-occur in plant communities in all habitat types worldwide, indicating that the dynamics we describe may take place in almost any community containing woody species, in any part of the world.

AB Evidence is increasing that animals may select habitats using direct cues (direct assessment hypothesis) and indirect cues, such as cuing on the presence of conspecifics (conspecific attraction hypothesis) and on their productivity in the previous year (public information hypothesis). We tested such hypotheses by studying the establishment of new territories (by inexperienced individuals) in the Black Kite (Milvus migrans), a long-lived, loosely colonial raptor, previously shown to exploit public information for foraging and dispersal decisions. All three hypotheses (direct assessment, conspecific attraction, and public information) were simultaneously supported; new territories were established on the basis of a complex system of integrated, direct and indirect cues, collected in the current and previous year. Exploitation of public information was allowed by the patchiness and moderate temporal predictability of breeding success (the information cue). Establishment of new territories near conspecifics involved a breeding cost for nearby previous residents, suggesting that conspecific cuing may be a form of information parasitism, at least in our system. Conspecific cuing affected nest spacing and population trend; mean nest spacing declined with colony size, while higher colony and population-level productivity in one year were followed by higher recruitment of new breeders in the following year, despite the delayed maturity of the species. All results were consistent with recent predictions by theoretical models.

AB The role of herbivores in nutrient cycling in tropical forest ecosystems remains poorly understood. This study investigates several aspects of nutrient cycling along a gradient in herbivore (Alouatta seniculus, red howler monkey) density among small landbridge islands in Lago Guri, Venezuela. Specifically, two contrasting hypotheses were addressed: (1) herbivores increase the availability of soil nutrients and subsequently primary productivity, and (2) herbivores decrease nutrient availability and primary productivity because they increase the dominance of non-preferred, nutrient-poor, tree species. Although C:N increased with herbivore density, the annual increase in basal area (an indicator of aboveground productivity) increased with herbivore density. According to an analysis of the tree communities on the study islands, herbivory may also be causing a shift in the tree community toward non-preferred species, and thus, over a longer time scale, both nutrient availability and productivity are expected to decline. The influence of herbivores on nutrient cycling and plant productivity has important implications for conservation and rates of carbon sequestration in tropical forests.

AB In tidal marshes, spatial and temporal variability in the importance of microbial metabolic pathways influences ecosystem-level processes such as soil carbon storage, the regeneration of inorganic nutrients, and the production of atmospherically important trace gases. We measured seasonal changes in rates of microbial Fe(III) reduction, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis in tidal freshwater and brackish marshes on the Patuxent River, Maryland, USA, and assessed the ability of plant roots to influence these processes by regenerating electron acceptors and supplying electron donors. In both marshes, the importance of microbial Fe(III) reduction was greatest early in the summer and decreased through the study period. Coincident with the seasonal decline in Fe(III) reduction, methanogenesis (freshwater marsh) or sulfate reduction (brackish site) increased in importance. At the brackish marsh, the partitioning of anaerobic carbon metabolism between Fe(III) reduction and sulfate reduction was similar within and below the root zone, suggesting that rhizosphere processes did not control anaerobic metabolism at this site. Instead, seasonal biogeochemical patterns at the brackish marsh were affected by factors such as water table depth and iron-sulfur interactions. At the tidal freshwater site, our results suggest that changes in rates of Fe(III) reduction and methanogenesis were directly affected by plantmediated processes. In midsummer, Fe(III) reduction accounted for a greater fraction of total anaerobic metabolism in rhizosphere-influenced surface soils than in soils below the root zone. High rates of Fe(III) reduction occurred at the expense of methanogenesis. This study documented strong temporal variations in the outcome of microbial competition for electron donors that ultimately affected the balance between Fe(III) reduction and methanogenesis within tidal freshwater marsh soils. Our data suggested that variations in microbial metabolic pathways were regulated by physiochemical factors at the brackish site and plant activity at the freshwater site. Plant regulation of Fe(III) reduction is a largely unstudied mechanism by which plants influence wetland carbon cycling and greenhouse gas production.

AB Host use and selection by herbivores are often determined by host chemistry. Lichen secondary chemicals frequently have been assumed to have a defensive role against herbivores similar to that of higher plants, but thus far there is only circumstantial evidence of the adverse effect of lichen secondary chemicals on specialized lichen-feeders. We studied the impact of lichen secondary metabolites on performance and host preference of lich-enivorous larvae of the moth Eilema depressum using a recently developed manipulation method that allows the removal of a major part of lichen secondary metabolites from the extracellular space of the lichen thallus without harming their primary metabolism.
   All larvae died on intact thalli of Vulpicida pinastri and Hypogymnia physodes, whereas, after extraction of most of the lichens' secondary chemicals (e.g., pinastric and physodic acids, respectively), survival of neonate larvae ranged between 75% and 85%. In turn, atranorin, the major secondary metabolite in the cortical layer of Parmelia sulcata, merely retarded the growth of larvae during their first days, but had no long-term impact on survival or performance of larvae. In preference experiments, treated thalli with lowered concentrations of lichen secondary metabolites, with the exception of Xanthoria parietina, were preferred to intact thalli containing secondary. chemicals. Our results show that lichen secondary metabolites may act, at natural concentrations, as strong antiherbivore compounds against E. depressum larvae and may play an important role in their host selection.

AB Forest expansion at the northern edge of the Great Plains is associated with increased availability of soil nitrogen (N). Studies of N dynamics typically focus on aboveground litter production, but in semiarid ecosystems, fine-root production greatly exceeds shoot production. We explored the contribution of root and shoot litter to N cycling in adjacent grassland and aspen (Populus tremuloides) forest at the northern edge of the Great Plains. We used a new approach to measure N inputs from root litter production: we combined root productivity data from minirhizotron images with N content data from several root diameter and color classes. We also measured the production and N content of aboveground litter. The novel contribution of our study comes from the simultaneous measurements of above- and belowground productivity and N input from litter production in adjacent forest and grassland habitats. Aboveground litter production was threefold greater in forest than in grassland (330 vs. 136 g(.)m(-2.)yr(-1)), but fine roots accounted for 80-90% of total litter production. As a result, total production was not significantly different between habitats, and the N contribution from total litter production was surprisingly similar between grassland (16.8 g(.)m(-2.)yr(-1)) and forest (17.1 g(.)m(-2.)yr(-1)). Thus in spite of great differences between habitats in aboveground litter production, N inputs from total litter production cannot explain the higher availability of N in forest soils. However, we found differences between habitats in root litter quality (forest, 1.14% N; grassland, 0.81% N, as well as in the seasonal and vertical distribution of root production. Grassland root production was significantly greater than,forest root production in early summer in the top 20 cm of soil.

These differences may increase available N in forest soils, but this increase is not attributable to differences in total litter production between habitats.

AB Despite growing attention to how human activities alter plant communities, little is known about the ecosystem consequences of these changes. We explore the relationship between species and functional diversity of herbaceous and shrubby plant communities in forested and deforested habitats in three Neotropical landscapes. We focus on six traits: pollination mechanism, dispersal mechanism, growth form, fruit type, fruit size, and seed size. We ask: (1) What is the relationship between species richness and functional diversity (trait state richness)? (2) Do species/functional diversity relationships differ between forested and deforested habitats? and (3) Are observed species/functional diversity patterns more consistent with ecological filtering or differentiation-based assembly processes? We show that species richness is often a weak surrogate for functional diversity, depending on the trait. Species/functional diversity relationships differ significantly between forested and deforested habitats, but the nature of-differences is trait dependent. Dispersal mechanism and fruit type number increased more rapidly in deforested than forested habitats, but the opposite was true for most other traits. Using a null model, we found evidence of ecological filtering for most traits in both habitats. Results demonstrate that deforested habitats do not necessarily contain lower functional diversity than forest but that the ecological assembly processes influencing community function in deforested communities differ dramatically from forest.

AB Until now, Quaternary paleoecologists have regarded evolution as a slow process relative to climate change, predicting that the primary biotic response to changing climate is not adaptation, but instead (1) persistence in situ if changing climate remains within the species' tolerance limits, (2) range shifts (migration) to regions where climate is currently within the species' tolerance limits, or (3) extinction. We argue here that all three of these outcomes involve evolutionary processes. Genetic differentiation within species is ubiquitous, commonly via adaptation of populations to differing environmental conditions. Detectable adaptive divergence evolves on a time scale comparable to change in climate, within decades for herbaceous plant species, and within centuries or millennia for longer-lived trees, implying that biologically significant evolutionary response can accompany temporal change in climate. Models and empirical studies suggest that the speed with which a population adapts to a changing environment affects invasion rate of new habitat and thus migration rate, population growth rate and thus probability of extinction, and growth and mortality of individual plants and thus productivity of regional vegetation. Recent models and experiments investigate the stability of species tolerance limits, the influence of environmental gradients on marginal populations, and the interplay of demography, gene flow, mutation rate, and other genetic processes on the rate of adaptation to changed environments. New techniques enable ecologists to document adaptation to changing conditions directly by resurrecting ancient populations from propagules buried in decades-old sediment. Improved taxonomic resolution from morphological studies of macrofossils and DNA recovered from pollen grains and macroremains provides additional information on range shifts, changes in population sizes, and extinctions. Collaboration between paleoecologists and evolutionary biologists can refine interpretations of paleorecords, and improve predictions of biotic response to anticipated climate change.

AB Spatial models predict that long-distance dispersal of offspring provides competitive superiority in open environments. We tested this prediction by artificially aggregating ramets of the spreading clonal species Agrostis stolonifera in an undisturbed environment and in an environment where flooding increased open space. We compared the competitive response of this manipulated Agrostis with both the natural ramet distribution of Agrostis and with the naturally aggregated clonal species Alopecurus pratensis.
   Our phenotypic manipulation of ramet dispersal significantly increased aggregation of clonal offspring, without altering the number of offspring, and thus provided an adequate test of spatial effects. Regardless of flooding, both Alopecurus and the aggregated Agrostis were more suppressed in species mixtures than the natural dispersed form of Agrostis. This demonstrates that long distance dispersal of ramets enhances competitive ability, at least in early stages of succession.

AB Habitat patches often differ in environmental conditions, and the degree of environmental heterogeneity among patches is thought to influence population dynamics at the regional (metapopulation) scale. In a previous Study, I found evidence of a source-sink dynamic in a metapopulation of the mayfly Callibaetis ferrugineus hageni occupying beaver ponds with or without brook trout predators, where adult females frequently dispersed among ponds, and frequently oviposited in ponds with trout. Here, I tested the hypothesis that trout create habitat sinks by manipulating trout densities and estimating local population growth rates (X) of Callibaetis. In addition, Callibaetis emergence rates were estimated in the mayfly generation before the manipulation. Among ponds, X ranged from 0.062 to 2.63 1, and nine Monte Carlo simulations scenarios revealed that four ponds had X significantly below replacement (sinks) while the presence of source ponds was less conclusive. The manipulation of trout did not result in a detectable treatment effect, perhaps because of low statistical power resulting from high within-treatment variation in trout densities. However, point estimates of lambda and emergence rates were negatively and exponentially related to trout density, such that nearly all ponds with more than 1 trout/100 m(2) were sinks. Further, multiple regression analyses were consistent with the hypothesis that trout reduced X and emergence rates, while other biotic and abiotic factors did not provide explanatory power. The results support the hypothesis that source-sink population dynamics may be common in freshwater habitats, and that prey metapopulation dynamics may be predicted from the distribution of predators, prey movement and habitat selection behaviors, and factors influencing the outcome of predator-prey interactions.

AB Both an individual ' s genotype and environment govern its phenotype, and this phenotype may have extended consequences for species interactions and communities. We examined the importance of plant genotype and environmental factors operating at large (habitat) and small (microhabitat) spatial scales in affecting a multitrophic arthropod community on plants. We planted 926 plants from 14 genotypes of Oenothera biennis into five natural habitats that represent the range of environments in which this plant. locally occurs. Genotypic differences among plants accounted for as much as 41% of the variation in arthropod diversity (Simpson ' s diversity index) and also affected arthropod evenness, richness, abundance, and biomass on individual plants. However, the effects of particular plant genotypes on the arthropod community varied across habitats (i.e., there were significant plant genotype-by-habitat interactions). Plant genotype explained more variation in the arthropod community than did environmental variation among microhabitats, but less variation than habitats, as predicted by the scale-dependent hypothesis. Herbivores and omnivores were more strongly affected by plant genetic variation than predators, consistent with the notion that phytophagous insects undergo stronger reciprocal interactions with plants than do predators. We detected heritable variation in arthropod community variables and the ability for the herbivore community to select on plant traits, suggesting that evolution in O. biennis can lead to changes in the arthropod community. Genetic variation in plant size, architecture, and reproductive phenology were the plant traits most strongly correlated with arthropod community variables. Our results demonstrate that genotype-by-environment interactions are a major determinant of arthropod community structure.

AB Metapopulation dynamics have received much attention in population biology and conservation. Most studies have dealt with species whose population turnover rate is much higher than the rate of patch turnover. Models of the dynamics in such systems have assumed a static patch landscape. The dynamics of many species, however, are likely to be significantly affected by the dynamics of their patches. We tested the relative importance of local conditions, connectivity, and dynamics of host tree patches on the metapopulation dynamics of a red-listed epiphytic moss, Neckera pennata, in Sweden. Repeated surveys of the species and its host trees were conducted at three sites over a period of six years. There was a positive effect of connectivity, and colonizations mainly occurred in the vicinity of occupied trees. Colonizations were also less likely on strongly leaning trees. Local extinctions sometimes occurred from small trees with low local abundances but were most often caused by treefall. Simulations of the future (100 years) dynamics of the system showed that the metapopulation size will be overestimated unless the increased local extinction rate imposed by the dynamics of the trees is accounted for. The simulations also suggested that local extinctions from standing trees may be disregarded in dynamic models for this species. This implies that the dynamics of N. pennata can be characterized as a patch-tracking metapopulation, where local extinctions are caused by patch destruction.

AB Theoretical and empirical research during the last decade suggests that increasing species richness often enhances ecosystem processes Such as productivity, nutrient cycling. or resistance to disturbance. By analogous reasoning, it can be hypothesized that genetic diversity within species will have equivalent effects; however, this hypothesis has rarely been tested. We present experimental support for the positive effects of intraspecific diversity on a key trait: larval settlement in a marine invertebrate, the barnacle Balanus improvisus. Varying within-species diversity levels of an animal over nine experiments, We found increasing larval settlement with increasing diversity (one, two, or three parental broods). Possible mechanisms explaining this pattern include: (1) facilitation of gregarious response through the presence of founder genotypes, and (2) ensuring genetic complementarity to increase future reproductive potential. Our results indicate that changing intraspecific genetic diversity could have hitherto unrecognized community-scale implications for larval recruitment and space occupancy.

AB The balance of evidence strongly indicates that the ecological repercussions of climatic changes are already apparent in the dynamics of animal and plant populations throughout terrestrial, marine, and aquatic ecosystems. However, while considerable progress has been made in quantifying effects of such climate change on spatiotemporal shifts in distribution, density, and phenology, subtle effects such as intra-annual variation in behavior have been ignored. Yet individual-based assessments of short-term dynamics of species interactions may be critical to improving our understanding of the implications of climate change for population and community dynamics. Using comprehensive, spatially replicated data on seasonal plant growth dynamics and seasonal distribution of muskoxen over a seven-year period, we show that interannual variations in the North Atlantic Oscillation affect the seasonal spatial dynamics of plant growth and; thereby, the seasonal spatial dynamics and social organization of muskoxen. Our results demonstrate a clear role of large-scale climate in the short-term trophic dynamics of this simple, arctic community.

AB Seabirds are considered to rely on prey that are patchily distributed and whose abundance differs greatly according to physical processes or water masses. However, very little information is available about the environmental factors and individual factors that affect the foraging success of marine predators. We studied the distribution of prey encounters, foraging success, and efficiency in different water masses and during two stages of the breeding season when energy requirements differed in Wandering Albatrosses (Diomedea exulans) of known experience and sex. The birds were simultaneously fitted with satellite transmitters, stomach temperature sensors,, and activity recorders. Only 27% of prey were captured in patches (distance between two prey < 1 km); the rest were caught at an average distance of 64 km. Prey in patches were smaller than isolated prey and were caught mainly at night. Diet analysis indicated that albatrosses preyed mainly upon adult squid: squid taken at night were smaller (bioluminescent species), whereas those taken during the day were larger (nonbioluminescent species). Birds spent more time foraging farther from the colony during incubation than during brooding, when their energy requirement was highest, but foraging effort (landings per hour, or kilometers per hour), foraging success (grams of prey per hour), and efficiency (grams of prey per landing per hour) were similar during the two stages. The rate of prey encounter and foraging efficiency did not differ between water masses or between oceanic and shelf-slope waters. We found no differences between the sexes in terms of foraging success and efficiency. Young, inexperienced individuals had foraging success and efficiency similar to those of older, experienced birds but had a different strategy: they foraged more actively and caught more prey at night than did experienced birds. These results suggest strongly that Wandering Albatrosses rely on prey that are highly dispersed, catch few prey within the same patch, and do not adjust foraging effort according to energy requirements. The unpredictability of the location of prey and the type of prey caught by Wandering Albatrosses indicate that the species has a unique foraging strategy compared to most seabirds, which generally concentrate in more predictable foraging areas.

AB Pollination by animals is critical to sexual reproduction of most angiosperms. However, little is known about variation in pollination service to single plant species. We report results of a long-term study of Ipomopsis aggregata, a semelparous montane herb whose flowers are visited by hummingbird and insect pollinators as well as "floral larcenists." We censused flower visitors over seven summers at permanent study sites separated by several hundred meters, and counted pollen delivered to flowers on a subset of plants observed for visitation. The species composition of the community of visitors varied significantly across years and within the flowering season; sites varied significantly only in the magnitude of parallel annual changes in the visitor community. Rates of flower visitation fluctuated over an order of magnitude or more. Variation in mean stigma pollen load among plants flowering in the same site and year was explained by a causal path model in which visitation rates by pollinators and larcenists had linear positive and negative effects, respectively. A simplified model including only pollinators explained almost as much variance as did the full model. However, qualitatively different parameter estimates were produced by an analogous causal model based on population means across site-year combinations. Discrepant results from within- and between-population levels of analysis suggest that pollen receipt is influenced by environmental factors that vary among sites and years, as well as by pollinator visit rates. We present a heuristic causal model that includes such factors, and we note its implications for ecological and evolutionary studies of pollination.

AB Habitat fragmentation is a leading cause of extinction, with effects that may be particularly pronounced in tropical ecosystems. However, little is known regarding the demographic mechanisms underlying changes in abundance in fragmented landscapes. Using six years of demographic data collected from > 6600 individuals of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata, we calculated population growth rate (lambda) in experimentally isolated 10-ha forest fragments, 1-ha forest fragments, and continuous forest. We then used life-table response experiment analyses to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for observed differences in lambda. On average, lambda approximate to 1.05 in continuous forest, while lambda approximate to 1 in both 1-ha and 10-ha fragments. However, while the differences in X between 10-ha fragments and continuous forest were largely attributable to the negative contribution of stage-specific fertility rates, reduced lambda in 1-ha fragments was due to both reductions in reproductive rates and changes in the rate of plant growth. Our results show that similar reductions in lambda in fragments of different sizes can be driven by distinct demographic mechanisms. Without comprehensive demographic data, attempts to mitigate the decline of populations in fragmented landscapes could be unsuccessful because they might be focusing on inappropriate demographic targets.

AB The probability of a rare event is usually estimated directly as the number of times the event occurs divided by the total sample size. Unfortunately, the precision of this estimate is low. For typical sample sizes of N < 100 in ecological studies, the coefficient of variation (cv) of this estimate of the probability of a rare event can exceed 300%. Sample sizes on the order of 10(3)-10(4) observations are needed to reduce the cv to below 10%. If it is impractical or impossible to increase the sample size, auxiliary data can be used to improve the precision of the estimate. We describe four approaches for using auxiliary data to improve the precision of estimates of the probability of a rare event: (1) Bayesian analysis that includes prior information about the probability; (2) stratification that incorporates information on the heterogeneity in the population; (3) regression models that account for information correlated with the probability; and (4) inclusion of aggregated data collected at larger spatial or temporal scales. These approaches are illustrated using data on the probability of capture of vespulid wasps by the insectivorous plant Darlingtonia californica. All four methods increase the precision of the estimate relative to the simple frequency-based estimate (absolute precision = 1.26, relative precision [cv] = 70%): stratification (absolute precision = 1.10, cv = 62%); regression models (absolute precision = 1.59, cv = 55%); Bayesian analysis with an informative prior probability distribution (absolute precision = 4.28, cv = 47%); and using temporally aggregated data (absolute precision 6.75, cv = 36%). When informative auxiliary data is available, we recommend including it when estimating the probability of rare events.

AB For the vast majority of cases, it is highly unlikely that all the individuals of a population will be encountered during a study. Furthermore, it is unlikely that a constant fraction of the population is encountered over times, locations, or species to be compared. Hence, simple counts usually will not be good indices of population size. We recommend that detection probabilities (the probability of including an individual in a count) be estimated and incorporated into inference procedures. However, most techniques for estimating detection probability require moderate sample sizes, which may not be achievable when studying rare species. In order to improve the reliability of inferences from studies of rare species, we suggest two general approaches that researchers may wish to consider that incorporate the concept of imperfect detectability: (1) borrowing information about detectability or the other quantities of interest from other times, places, or species; and (2) using state variables other than abundance (e.g., species richness and occupancy). We illustrate these suggestions with examples and discuss the relative benefits and drawbacks of each approach.

AB Quantitative estimates of abundance for rare plants can be difficult, as the most widely used sampling techniques are ill-suited for rarity. Adaptive cluster sampling (ACS) can take advantage of the spatial clustering common in rare plant populations to provide more efficient unbiased estimates of population sizes than simple random sampling. When plants are found in a quadrat, all adjacent quadrats are adaptively added to the sample. Despite this biased sampling, the Horvitz-Thompson estimator for adaptive cluster sampling provides unbiased estimates of population means or totals, and variances of those estimates. Because ACS disproportionately samples quadrats with plants, it can provide additional efficiency whenever further attributes of rare individuals need to be assessed, such as demographic parameters or genotypes. Adaptive cluster sampling was performed on a population of Aletris bracteata, a moderately visible herbaceous species, in a savanna near Chekika, Everglades National Park, Florida. Both 1-m(2) and 4-m(2) quadrats provided reasonable estimates of the population size. The 1-m(2) sampling included 30-36% of the estimated total plants while sampling only 5% of the total area. The 4-m(2) sampling captured 78% of the estimated total population while sampling only 21% of the area.

AB Interspecific competition between phytophagous insects can occur when plant responses induced by an early-season herbivore alter host quality for later colonizers. Recent evidence for specificity in the elicitation of induced plant responses by different attackers suggests that dynamics of host use in the field may be more complex than previously anticipated, because host suitability for colonizing herbivores may depend on which herbivore species has initially damaged a plant. In each of two years, we manipulated the first herbivore to attack Solanum dulcainara plants in an experimental population using several different arthropod species and subsequently monitored colonization by natural herbivores over the course of the growing season. We additionally performed weekly herbivore counts in wild S. dulcamara populations following natural variation in herbivore arrival. Plant-mediated interactions occurred primarily between two leaf-feeding beetles, Psylliodes qffinis and Plagiometriona clovata. In both manipulatiye and observational experiments, P. clavata oviposition was reduced on plants initially damaged by P. affinis (or a third leaf-feeding beetle, Lema trilinea) relative to plants that were initially undamaged. Lowored P. clavata occurrence continued through subsequent life-history stages, resulting in decreased emergence of second-generation P. clavata adults on these plants. The occurrence of P. affinis was also lowered on plants damaged by conspecifics in both manipulative and observational experiments. Resistance against P. qffinis also followed applications of jasmonic acid, an elicitor of plant defensive responses. Conversely, early-season damage by P. clavata did not influence plant quality for either later conspecifics or P. affinis. Initial herbivory by the spittlebug Aphrophora saratogensis or generalist taildropper slugs (Prophysaon sp.) likewise had no influence on P. clavata and P. qffinis colonization, whereas L. trilinea damage did not affect later arriving P. affinis. Hence, only a subset of early-season damagers influenced herbivore occurrence on S. dulcamara. Preference tests examining P. affinis feeding and P. clavata oviposition confirmed that specificity in elicitation of induced plant responses produced the divergent herbivore occurrence patterns observed in the field. Overall, the existence of plant-mediated competitive asymmetry between herbivore species on S. duleamara highlights the dynamic nature of plant resistance and its potential role in organizing herbivore communities.

AB The relative importance of local and regional factors to community buildup is a key question in community ecology. Dispersal capacity is an important regional determinant but is very difficult to assess. Instead, measuring colonization rates in newly created habitats can provide a reasonable approximation of dispersal capacities. We monitored cladoceran zooplankton colonization rates in 25 newly dug and isolated pools. During the first 15 months, an average of 4.2 cladoceran species colonized each pool. In total, 20 different species were found during this period in the pools, representing 40% of the total species richness observed during summer in well-established cladoceran communities in water bodies in the immediate neighborhood (within 3 km) of the studied new pools. Our results reveal high colonization rates of newly created habitats by cladoceran zooplankton, reflecting a high dispersal capacity in this group of organisms. We discuss these results in light of the extent and ecological and evolutionary impact of dispersal in aquatic organisms.

AB Only a fraction of the individuals in a given prey population are likely to be killed and consumed by predators. In contrast, nearly all individuals experience the chronic effects of predation risk. When threatened by predators, prey adopt defensive tactics whole costs can lead to reduced growth, maturation rates, survivorship, fecundity, or population density. This nonconsumptive impact of predation risk on prey is known as a "trait-mediated interaction" (TMI) because it results from changes in prey traits such as behavior or physiology. Ecological theory suggests that the strength of TMI effects will reflect a balance between the conflicting demands of reproduction vs. predator avoidance. Competitor density and resource availability are expected to alter the balance between these conflicting forces. We conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured TMI effect size while varying competitor and/or resource density. The threat of predation had an overall negative effect on prey performance, but the strength of this effect varied with the level of competition. High competition exacerbated the negative effect of intimidation on prey density but moderated the negative effect of intimidation on prey life history and growth. We discuss these results in light of previously published theoretical expectations. Our results highlight the variable and context-dependent nature of interspecific interactions.

AB Understanding of spatial pattern and scale has been identified as a key issue in ecology, yet ecology has traditionally lacked necessary tools for making inference about relationships between scale-specific patterns. We introduce wavelet-coefficient regression, in which the dependent and independent variables are wavelet transformed prior to analysis, as a means to formalize scale-specific relationships in ecological data. We apply this method to data on vegetation and environmental factors related to water availability from Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park (California, USA). We find that the wavelet transform and wavelet-coefficient regression efficiently characterize scale-specific pattern in these data. We also find that different environmental factors show up as good predictors of vegetation growth at different scales and that these differences in scale greatly facilitate interpretation of the mechanisms relating water availability to vegetation growth.

AB Most flowering plants rely on animal pollinators to transfer mate gametes between individuals, and thus a significant problem for gender dimorphic plants is that pollinators often avoid female flowers. Here we show for the first time that one important reason pollinators shun female flowers is because they do not smell like males. We compared emission rates and floral scent composition in a gynodioecious wild strawberry (Fragaria virginiana) where females receive half as many visits by generalist pollinators as conspecific hermaphrodites. We used floral extracts to determine the Source of sexually dimorphic odor and pollinator responses. Specifically, we used extracts of whole flowers and specific floral parts in choice tests to determine that pollinators preferred the scent of hermaphrodite flowers over those of females and that this discrimination was-due primarily to the scent of hermaphrodite anthers. These data conclusively show that scent can be a major driver of pollinator behavior in gender dimorphic plants. Our results also indicate that scent is an important modulator of pollinator behavior even in a small flowered, weakly scented species visited by generalist pollinators, and not just peculiar to intensely scented, deceptive, or specialized pollination systems.

AB Species patchiness implies that nearby observations of species abundance tend to be similar or that individual conspecific organisms are more closely spaced than by random chance. This can be caused either by the positive spatial autocorrelation among the locations of individual organisms due to ecological spatial processes (e.g., species dispersal, competition for space and resources) or by spatial dependence due to (positive or negative) species responses to underlying environmental conditions. Both forms of spatial structure pose problems for statistical analysis, as spatial autocorrelation in the residuals violates the assumption of independent observations, while environmental heterogeneity restricts the comparability of replicates. In this paper, we discuss how spatial structure due to ecological spatial processes and spatial dependence affects spatial statistics, landscape metrics, and statistical modeling of the species-environment correlation. For instance, while spatial statistics can quantify spatial pattern due to an endogeneous spatial process, these methods are severely affected by landscape environmental heterogeneity. Therefore, statistical models of species response to the environment not only need to accommodate spatial structure, but need to distinguish between components due to exogeneous and endogeneous processes rather than discarding all spatial variance. To discriminate between different components of spatial structure, we suggest using (multivariate) spatial analysis of residuals or delineating the spatial realms of a stationary spatial process using boundary detection algorithms. We end by identifying conceptual and statistical challenges that need to be addressed for adequate spatial analysis of landscapes.

AB The traditional emphasis in ecology on local species interactions has recently broadened to include landscape-level processes. I used data from a seven-year survey of ponds in northern Switzerland to judge the relative contributions of local and landscape influences to the occurrence and density of larvae of eight amphibian species. Each pond was sampled twice each year using pipe samples and dip nets. Analyses evaluated support for a series of alternative models, some suggested by current ideas in aquatic ecology and others designed to reveal the impact of key variables. Results strongly supported models that include both local and landscape covariates. Species differed in preference for permanent or temporary ponds, high- or low-predator ponds, and landscapes within forested or open areas. The occurrence of all species was positively correlated with the densities of other species, suggesting that competition was less important than variation in quality among sites. The results emphasize the importance of local processes in governing the status of populations, because even landscape-level effects were probably caused by availability of habitat during the terrestrial stage, rather than by metapopulation processes.

AB Biogeographic theory argues that consumer-prey interactions are more intense, and prey defenses better developed, at lower latitudes. Along the Atlantic Coast of the United States, low-latitude salt marsh plants are less palatable than high-latitude con-specifics. To test the hypothesis that latitudinal variation in palatability would occur in the absence of geographically different environmental cues (i.e., that differences in palatability are constitutive rather than induced by climate or herbivore damage), we grew high- and low-latitude individuals of three species of salt marsh plants from seeds (Solidago sempervirens) or rhizome cuttings (Distichlis spiccita and Spartina alterniflora) in a common-garden greenhouse environment, and compared their palatability to herbivores over time. We also quantified leaf toughness and nitrogen content over time in order to help explain results of feeding assays. High-latitude plants were always more palatable to herbivores than low-latitude conspecifics. Latitudinal variation in plant traits depended on the plant species. Toughness varied as a function of latitude for Spartina, with low-latitude plants being consistently tougher than high-latitude conspecifics. For all generations of Spartina, and for seed-propagated Solidago, high-latitude plants had a higher nitrogen content than low-latitude conspecifics. The fact that latitudinal differences in palatability and traits of salt marsh plants persisted in a common-garden environment suggests that this variation is constitutive, and likely under genetic control, rather than a plastic response to environmental cues. These results are consistent with the theory that latitudinal differences in herbivory have selected for geographical variation in plant palatability, although we cannot rule out other selective forces that may also vary across latitude.

AB Understanding habitat selection is of primary interest in theoretical and applied ecology. One approach is to infer habitat selection processes from differences in population densities between habitats using methods such as isodar and isoleg analysis. Another approach is to directly observe the movements of individuals. However, habitat selection models based on movement data often fail to adequately incorporate spatial processes. This is problematic if the probability of selecting a particular habitat is dependent upon its spatial context. This would occur, for example, where organisms exhibit home range behavior and the choice of habitat is dependent on its location relative to the home range. In this paper we present a spatially explicit habitat selection model for movement data that incorporates home range behavior as a spatial process. Our approach extends a previous model by formulating the probability of selecting a habitat as a function of its distance from the animal's current location and home range center. We demonstrate that these enhancements lead to more parsimonious models when applied to a koala radio-tracking data set from eastern Australia. This approach could also be applied to modeling other spatial habitat selection processes, leading to more biologically meaningful models for a range of species and applications.

AB Outside of the humid tropics, abiotic factors are generally considered the dominant regulators of decomposition, and biotic influences are frequently not considered in predicting decomposition. rates. In this study, I examined the effect of termite assemblage composition and abundance on decomposition of wood litter of an indigenous species (Croton megalobotrys) in five terrestrial habitats of the highly seasonal semiarid Okavango Delta region of northern Botswana, to determine whether natural variation in decomposer community composition and abundance influences decomposition rates. I conducted the study in two areas, Xudum and Santawani, with the Xudum study preceding the Santawani study. I assessed termite assemblage composition and abundance using a grid of survey baits (rolls of toilet paper) placed on the soil surface and checked 2-4 times/month. I placed a billet (a section of wood litter) next to each survey bait and measured decomposition in a plot by averaging the mass loss of its billets. Decomposition rates varied up to sixfold among plots within the same habitat and locality, despite the fact that these plots experienced the same climate. In addition, billets decomposed significantly faster during the cooler and drier Santawani study, contradicting climate-based predictions. Because termite incidence was generally higher in Santawani plots, termite abundance initially seemed a likely determinant of decomposition in this system. However, no significant effect of termite incidence on billet mass loss rates was observed among the Xudum plots, where decomposition rates remained low even though termite incidence varied considerably. Considering the incidences of fungus-growing termites and non-fungus-growing termites separately resolves this apparent contradiction: in both Santawani and Xudum, only fungus-growing termites play a significant role in decomposition. This result is mirrored in an analysis of the full data set of combined Xudum and Santawani data. The determination that natural variation in the abundance of a single taxonomic group of soil fauna, a termite subfamily, determines almost all observed variation in decomposition rates supports the emerging view that biotic influences may be important in many biomes and that consideration of decomposer community composition and abundance may be critical for accurate prediction of decomposition rates.

AB Understanding the structure of food webs, and the mechanisms that give rise to this structure, is one of the most challenging problems in ecology. We analyze from a statistical physics perspective the network structure of model food webs and of 15 community food webs from a variety of environments, including freshwater, marine, estuarine, and terrestrial environments. We perform a theoretical analysis of two recently proposed models for food webs, the niche model of R. J. Williams and N. D. Martinez and the nested-hierarchy model of M.-E Cattin et al. We find that the two models generate distributions of numbers of prey, predators, and links that are described by the same analytical expressions. Our analytical treatment reveals that a model's capacity to reproduce empirical data is principally determined by its ability to satisfy two conditions: (1) the species' niche values form a totally ordered set and (2) each species has a specific exponentially decaying probability of preying on a given fraction of the species with lower niche values. To test this hypothesis, we generalize the cascade model of J. E. Cohen and C. M. Newman so that it satisfies condition 2 and find that the new model is able to reproduce the properties of empirical food webs, validating our hypothesis. We use our analytical predictions as a guide to the analysis of 15 of the most complete empirical food webs available. We demonstrate that the quantitative unifying patterns that describe the properties of the food-web models considered earlier also describe the majority of the empirical webs considered. We find good agreement between the empirical data and the models for the average distance between species and the average clustering coefficient. Our results strongly support two hypotheses: first, that any model satisfying the two conditions we identify will accurately reproduce a number of the statistical properties of empirical food webs, and second, that the empirical distributions of number of prey and number of predators follow universal functional,forms that, without free parameters, match our analytical predictions.

AB The temporal symmetry approach of R. Pradel can be used with capture-recapture data to produce retrospective estimates of a population's growth rate, lambda(i), and the relative contributions to lambda(i) from different components of the population. Direct estimation of lambda(i) provides an afternative to using population projection matrices to estimate asymptotic lambda and is seeing increased use. However, the robustness of direct estimates of lambda(1) to violations of several key assumptions has not yet been investigated. Here, we consider tag loss as a possible source of bias for scenarios in which the rate of tag loss is (1) the same for all marked animals in the population and (2) a function of tag age. We computed analytic approximations of the expected values for each of the parameter estimators involved in direct estimation and used those values to calculate bias and precision for each parameter estimator. Estimates of lambda(i) were robust to homogeneous rates of tag loss. When tag loss rates varied by tag age, bias occurred for some of the sampling situations evaluated, especially those with low capture probability, a high rate of tag loss, or both. For situations with low rates of tag loss and high capture probability, bias was low and often negligible. Estimates of contributions of demographic components to lambda(i) were not robust to tag loss. Tag loss reduced the precision of all estimates because tag loss results in fewer marked animals remaining available for estimation. Clearly tag loss should be prevented if possible, and should be considered in analyses of lambda(i), but tag loss does not necessarily preclude unbiased estimation of lambda(i).

AB We simulated the effects of missing information on statistical distributions of animal response that covaried with measured predictors of habitat to evaluate the utility and performance of quantile regression for providing more useful intervals of uncertainty in habitat relationships. These procedures were evaulated for conditions in which heterogeneity and hidden bias were induced by confounding with missing variables associated with other improtant processes, a problem common in statistical modeling of ecological phenomena. Simulations for a large (N = 10000) finite population representing grid locations on a landscape demonstrated various forms of hidden bias that might occur when the effect of a measured habitat variable on some animal was confounded with the effect of another unmeasured variable. Quantile (0 <= tau <= 1) regression parameters for linear models that excluded the important, unmeasured variable revealed bias relative to parameters from the generating model. Depending on whether interactions of the measured and unmeasured variables were negative (interference interactions) or positive (facilitation interactions) in simulations without spatial structuring. either upper (tau > 0.5) or lower (tau < 0.5) quantile regression parameters were less biased than mean rate parameters. Heterogeneous, nonlinear response patterns Occurred with correlations between the measured and unmeasured variables. When the unmeasured variable was spatially structured. variation in parameters across quantiles associated with heterogeneous effects of the habitat variable was reduced by modeling the spatial trend surface as a cubic polynomial of location coordinates, but substantial hidden bias remained. Sampling (n = 20-300) simulations demonstrated that regression quantile estimates and confidence intervals constructed by invertin-weighted rank score tests provided valid coverage of these parameters. Local forms of quantile weighting were required for obtaining correct Type I error rates and confidence interval coverage. Quantile regression was used to estimate effects of physical habitat resources on a bivalve (Macomona liliana) in the spatially structured landscape on a sandflat in a New Zealand harbor. Confidence intervals around predicted 0.10 and 0.90 quantiles were used to estimate sampling intervals containing 80% of the variation in densities in relation to bed elevation. Spatially structured variation in bivalve counts estimated by a cubic polynomial trend surface remained after accounting for the nonlinear effects of bed elevation, indicating the existence of important spatially structured processes that were not adequately represented by the measured habitat variables.

AB The importance of body size to reproductive success has often been emphasized, but timing of arrival to the breeding grounds may also be important. To assess the relative roles of size and timing, we investigated the influence of life history and of behavioral and morphological traits on realized reproductive success in wild pink salmon, Oncorhynchus gorbuscha, during the 1997 and 1998 spawning seasons. Reproductive success was quantified by the number of adult offspring returning to spawn (1999 and 2000; parentage determined via DNA microsatellite genotyping). Males that arrived earlier, lived longer in the stream, and were more often observed in dominant courtship positions had significantly more offspring, although the importance of dominance was overshadowed by timing. Female reproductive success was not closely linked to any measured trait, but stabilizing selection on arrival timing and length is possible, as 1998 fish showing intermediate values of these traits were the most productive. Bear predation accounted for up to 50% of the mortality on the spawning grounds, yet did not have detectable effects on reproductive success. The absence of strong linear relationships between reproductive success and such traits as body size and fecundity may indicate that selection has driven the population to equilibrium values.

AB Little information is available regarding red wood ant (RWA; Formica rufa group) impacts on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in forest ecosystems. We found that RWA mound density (number per ha) was linked to forest tree species composition, slope aspect, and canopy closure. The size of RWA mounds was positively correlated with successional age of the stands. C and N concentrations of mound material were significantly higher than in the forest floor, while C:N ratios were not. RWA mound C and N pools were found to be significantly lower (<= 990 kg C/ha and <= 21 kg N/ha) than in the forest floor. RWA mounds were "hot spots" for CO2 emissions ranging from 12.4 (mid July) to 3.5 (early September) times higher than the adjacent forest floor. Overall, they contributed 0.7-2.5% to total forest soil CO2 emissions. Consequently, the contribution of RWA to total forest soil C and N pools and forest CO2 emission is minor and likely not important when calculating or modeling C and N pools or C fluxes. Yet, RWAs increase the spatial heterogeneity of soil C and nutrients and alter the flow of energy within their habitat.

AB The elemental composition of plants, which affects ecosystem processes such as energy transfer to consumers and nutrient recycling, varies with the supply of nutrients and light. In contrast to most terrestrial systems, aquatic plants "compete" with abiotic light absorbents. Light supply to pelagic producers and, consequently, algal carbon to nutrient stoichiometry are therefore affected by background turbidity (light absorption by non-algal components, K-bg) and mixing depth (vertical extension of the mixed water column, z). Still, light as a dynamic variable has been neglected in models exploring the ecological consequences of flexible algal stoichiometry. In addition, there are hardly any field experiments exploring effects of light supply on planktonic systems. We present a dynamical model that accounts for the simultaneous dependence of algal production on light supply and internal algal nutrient stores and derive predictions on how a suite of state variables (algal biomass, light climate, algal nutrient stoichiometry, dissolved nutrient concentration, and nutrients in sediment) should be affected by z and K-bg. We compare these predictions with results of an enclosure experiment in a phosphorus-deficient lake, in which we manipulated z and K-bg. Algal biomass decreased at higher K-bg and showed a unimodal response to z (being limited by sinking losses at shallow z and by light at deep z). The biomass peak shifted toward lower z with increased K-bg. The seston carbon: phosphorus ratio decreased with increasing z and K-bg. Dissolved mineral phosphorus was undetectable in all treatments. Total water column phosphorus and sedimented phosphorus increased with increasing z but were unaffected by K-bg. These data are in almost complete qualitative congruence with model predictions over the examined range of mixing depths (1-15 m). The model thus provides a useful framework for the continued mechanistic exploration of how environmental drivers influence producer stoichiometry in pelagic environments.

AB Patch occupancy models provide a simple phenomenological approach to evaluating ecological questions on a metapopulation scale. In this study, I use and modify a patch occupancy model to evaluate the effects of synchronous extinctions correlated with flooding and patch-size-dependent migration on the regional dynamics of a neotropical beetle, Cephaloleia fenestrata. Various methods have been used to evaluate patch occupancy models. Previous authors most commonly have evaluated patch occupancy models by logistic regression of incidence functions. Likelihoods produced from regression methods, however, neglect autocorrelation in spatial occupancy patterns even though spatial autocorrelation is common in ecological data. In this study, I used a Monte Carlo method of model evaluation, which accounts for spatial autocorrelation. Results suggest that patches undergo synchronous extinctions correlated with flooding and this affects regional dynamics of C. fenestrata. Immigration probability positively correlated with patch size, and emigration probability negatively correlated with patch size, also affecting C. fenestrata regional dynamics. The patch occupancy pattern was positively spatially autocorrelated at only two of the sites, but was nearly significant at another. The logistic regression method was a reasonable alternative to the Monte Carlo method for model evaluation. Other model evaluation methods (fits to model development data, proportion of occupied patches, and turnover rates) were inconsistent (at best) quantitative measures of a model's fit to independent data. When used to select among competing models, however, the fits to model development data were reasonably good indicators of fits to independent data. Given the increased complexity involved in using the Monte Carlo method, the simpler logistic regression method may be a preferable alternative, especially when spatial autocorrelation is minimal.

AB There are at least two reasons why animals searching for a new habitat might be attracted to cues produced by competitors, predators, or other factors that reduce their fitness after they arrive and settle in the new habitat. First, such cues may be associated with other factors that enhance fitness after arrival. A simple model illustrates the conditions that favor indirect cue use, even when those cues are produced by factors with negative effects on fitness. Second, cues that improve the ability of dispersers to detect low-quality habitats may increase the likelihood that those individuals will be attracted to, and settle in, those habitats. In particular, attraction to detection cues produced by factors in low quality habitats is likely when dispersers are relatively nonselective when they are searching for a new habitat. In such situations, cues that improve habitat detection can lead to more immigrants settling in low-quality habitats than is predicted on the basis of the relative abundance of those habitats in the landscape, a pattern that may encourage the erroneous conclusion that individuals prefer to settle in low-quality habitats. Examples are provided illustrating the application of these ideas to problems in basic and applied ecology.

AB Although the importance of mutualisms in structuring communities is becoming increasingly appreciated, relatively little is known about the degree to which potential mutualists are interchangeable with respect to the services they provide their host. We examined the degree to which potential mutualists of a seaweed provide complementary vs. redundant benefits to their host to begin to assess the effects of mutualist diversity on host performance. The gastropods Anachis lafresnayi (Costoanachis lafresnayi) and Mitrella lunata (Astyris lunata) are common associates of the red alga Chondrus crispus in subtidal locations in southern New England. Field surveys showed that where these snails were rare, Chondrus was sparse and covered with a heavy growth of sessile invertebrates, but where snails were common, Chondrus was abundant and free from fouling overgrowth. In manipulative field experiments, plants with no snails had the most overgrowth (measured both as percent cover and total mass) and lost 25% of their mass in five weeks. Plants with either species of snail alone were also heavily fouled and lost mass. Those with only Mitrella were overgrown by solitary ascidians, whereas those with only Anachis were overgrown by bryozoans, suggesting that both snails remove epibionts, but they differ in the suite of epibionts they are capable of removing. As a result, only Chondrus with both species of snail present remained unfouled and gained mass over the course of the experiment. Field tethering experiments showed that both snail species can gain a refuge from crab predation by associating with Chondrus. Our results show that these two snail species are not interchangeable and they provide complementary benefits to their host because they differ in their prey preferences. If this type of differentiation in resource use often mediates coexistence among mutualists, then complementary effects of mutualists on their hosts may be common.

AB Avian parents influence the onset of development, hatching synchrony, and likelihood of brood reduction through the onset of incubation. Studies testing adaptive functions of brood reduction assume that eggs are protected by their shells and waiting for parents to initiate incubation in a manner that creates optimal hatching patterns, but the viability of early laid eggs may diminish over time due to putative effects of ambient temperature. We tested effects of exposure to ambient temperature on the viability of unincubated bird eggs using an altitudinal climate gradient in Puerto Rico: daily maximum temperatures nearly always exceed developmental zero in the lowland forest, whereas temperatures rarely exceed developmental zero in the cloud forest and at intermediate altitudes. We removed 382 freshly laid Pearly-eyed Thrasher (Margarops fuscatus) eggs, placed them in holding boxes at three sites for 1-7 days, and returned them to nests to be incubated. Additional control eggs (n = 39) tested effects of both handling and movement on hatching success, and unmanipulated eggs (n = 139) provided a measure of natural hatching success. Hatching success of control eggs (82.0%) and unmanipulated eggs (84.9%) did not differ, indicating no impacts of handling on hatchability. Hatching success of experimental eggs exposed for one day (78.6%) was high but declined very strongly after exposure for three days (41.9%), five days (11.5%) and seven days (2.1%). Hatchability of eggs held at the cloud forest did not differ from eggs held at the lowland site but was lower for eggs exposed at mid-elevation. Hatching success was positively related to minimum temperature and marginally related to mean temperature and proportion of time above developmental zero. Exposure duration, treatment site, and maximum temperature were the only significant effects identified by stepwise logistic regression. Eggs held at the lowland site had shorter developmental periods than eggs held at other sites. Most embryo mortality (80.8%) occurred at very early stages. Our results demonstrate that viability of unincubated eggs exposed to moist tropical conditions declines strongly but suggest that ambient temperature is not the sole cause. We compare rates of egg viability decline among species, examine alternative mechanisms for the loss of viability, and discuss the significance of egg viability on avian life histories.

AB Most species abundance data show that a small number of species contribute the vast majority of individuals to a community. Thus, most taxa in a community are uncommon or rare. Yet such species will frequently be of ecological, conservation, or management interest. Data for uncommon or rare species will be presence/absence data or counts of abundance that contain a greater number of zero observations than would be predicted using standard, unimodal statistical distributions. Such data are generally referred to as zero-inflated data and require specialized methods for statistical analysis. Statistical approaches to modeling zero-inflated data include nonstandard mixture models; two-part, conditional models; and birth process models. In this paper, we briefly summarize two of these methods and illustrate the two-part, conditional approach to the problem of modeling count data with extra zeros. An advantage of this approach includes separate fits and separate interpretations of both components of count data; that is to say, the presence/absence component and the abundance component (given presence) can be analyzed separately. This can be valuable not only for simplicity, but also such a two-step method may assist ecological understanding in cases where the basis for species presence might be separated from the underlying reasons affecting the population size of that species at those sites where it is present.
   We present two case studies of the application of the two-part conditional model for modeling count data with extra zeros. One deals with modeling relationships between counts of the rare and endangered arboreal marsupial, Leadbeater's possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri) and habitat variables in the wet eucalypt forests of southeastern Australia. The other is an analysis of data obtained from a monitoring study of seabird nesting from the Coral Sea off northeastern Australia. Finally,, we briefly discuss some inferential and practical issues in developing designs and models for presence/absence data (which is the first component in the two-part conditional approach) when observed occurrences are low (e.g., < 5%).

AB Demographic models are an increasingly important tool in population biology. However, these models, especially stochastic matrix models, are based upon a multitude of parameters that must usually be estimated with only a few years of data and limited sample sizes within each year, calling into question the accuracy of the results of these models. We first discuss how these data limitations create sampling uncertainty and bias in the estimated parameters for a stochastic demography model. Next, we ask whether limited data can favor the construction of deterministic models that ignore variation and correlation of rates. With less than five years of data, the mean squared error of deterministic models will sometimes be smaller than that of stochastic models, favoring the use of simple models, even when their predictions are known to be biased. Finally, we introduce a procedure to estimate the sampling variation around population growth rate estimates made from demographic models that are based on specified sampling durations and intensities.

AB Postnatal dispersal, defined as dispersal from the natal patch soon after reaching maturity, is common in a variety of insect species. Postnatal dispersal may increase connections among subpopulations and, thus, significantly affect local population dynamics in metapopulation and source-sink contexts. Yet most mark-recapture studies,of insects miss the postnatal dispersal phase because it comes soon after eclosion. Cephaloleia fenestrata (Chrysomelidae) is a specialist herbivore of the rolled leaves of Pleiostachya pruinosa (Marantaceae, common name "prayer plant"). Some P. pruinosa patches were flooded prior to the onset of this study, extirpating the majority of C. fenestrata in the flood zone and providing a natural experiment and an opportunity to observe recolonization dynamics. We built a spatially explicit population projection matrix model to simulate spatial population dynamics of C. fenestrata. The model was a poor fit to the empirical data. Adding postnatal dispersal to the model resulted in a much better model fit. This study suggests that 81% of C. fenestrata disperse from the natal site soon after eclosion. Model simulations indicated that postnatal dispersal increases the mean population size in the flood zone more than six-fold and the standard deviation more than three-fold. Herein we present an implicit method of estimating postnatal dispersal when marking animals before the postnatal dispersal phase is problematic.

AB The trichome dimorphism of Datura wrightii is intriguing because glandular trichome production has a high fitness cost. Plants producing glandular trichomes ("sticky" plants) are resistant to many insect herbivores that attack plants producing nonglandular trichomes ("velvety" plants). When protected from herbivores, sticky plants initially produce fewer seeds than velvety plants but grow to a larger size. In a three-year field experiment, we tested the hypothesis that sticky plants acquire a competitive advantage through greater vegetative growth. In the absence of herbivores, sticky and velvety plants grew to similar sizes in their first year, but sticky plants grew larger in the second and third years. Seed production of sticky plants was 46-60% less than velvety plants in their first year, and this caused a 13% reduction in their finite rate of increase overall, even though sticky plants produced more seeds than velvety plants did in later years. The impact of herbivory varied with plant density, and herbivores reduced plant fitness more at low plant density than at high plant density. The differences in growth associated with trichome morphology occurred too late to provide a competitive advantage to sticky plants and probably contribute little to the maintenance of D. wrightii's trichome dimorphism.

AB For elk (Cervus elaphus) in the Gallatin drainage of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, Montana, USA, wolf movements caused local predation risk to vary substantially on a time scale of days. Spatially and temporally fine-scaled data from GPS radio collars show that elk moved into the protective cover of wooded areas when wolves were present, reducing their use of preferred grassland foraging habitats that had high predation risk. By constraining habitat selection, wolves may have greater effects oil elk dynamics than would be predicted oil the basis of direct predation alone. Based on changes in the woody vegetation following the reintroduction of wolves, it has been suggested that antipredator responses by elk may be driving a trophic cascade in the Yellowstone ecosystem. However, Studies to date have been hampered by a lack of direct data on spatial variation in predation risk, and the ways in which elk respond to variation in risk. Our data Support a central portion of the hypothesis that elk antipredator behavior could drive a trophic cascade, but changes in elk numbers are also likely to have affected elk-plant interactions.

AB The role of diversity in buffering environmental change remains poorly tested in natural systems. Diversity might enhance stability if different species have different disturbance susceptibilities (i.e., functional complementarity). Alternatively, diversity might decrease stability because, at high diversity, populations are predicted to be more temporally variable and therefore more vulnerable to extinction following perturbation. There is theoretical support for both hypotheses but limited empirical evidence. I examine these issues with experimental burning along a natural diversity gradient in a savanna where fire has been suppressed for 150 years. I examined how two components of stability, resistance (invasion by added and naturally recruiting species) and resilience (recovery of the predisturbance light levels, the primary limiting resource in this system), varied with diversity. I also examined how the abundance of dominant species and soil depth affected stability, as both are negatively correlated with diversity and could have hidden impacts (e.g., invasion resistance on shallow soils correlated with diversity but caused by moisture stress). Species-rich communities were stable because they contained fire-tolerant species that, despite their rarity, significantly increased in cover after fire, reduced light availability, and limited seedling survival. Species-poor communities were rapidly invaded, apparently due to the combined effects of (1) trade-offs between competitive ability and disturbance tolerance (dominants in species-poor areas were competitive but fire sensitive), and (2) low functional complementarity. Colonization by woody plants was also significantly higher in low-diversity plots; these species are known to form a new stable state that excludes all savanna taxa. The abundance of dominants and soil depth were negatively correlated with diversity because they appear to determine its spatial variation in the absence of fire, but diversity alone accounted for variation in stability. Without burning, most subordinates are confined to shallower soils where they play a minor role in controlling resource flows and production. Diversity, therefore, was more important for buffering the effects of change than controlling ecosystem function under undisturbed conditions. If applicable to other systems, the results indicate that species loss will compound the negative effects of environmental change on ecosystem function by limiting the ability of ecosystems to respond.

AB The uptake of resources from the environment is a vital process for all organisms. Many experimental studies have revealed that the rate at which this process occurs depends critically on the resource concentration, a relationship called "functional response." However, whether the concentration of the consumer normally affects the functional response has been the subject of a long-standing, predominantly theoretical, debate in ecology. Here we present an experimental test between the alternative hypotheses that food uptake depends either only on the resource concentration or on both the resource and the consumer concentrations. In short-term laboratory experiments, we measured the uptake of radioactively labeled, unicellular green algae (Monoraphidium minutum, resource) by the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus (a consumer) for varying combinations of resource and consumer concentrations. We found that the food uptake by Brachionus depended on the algal concentration with the relationship best described by a Holling type 3 functional response. We detected significant consumer effects on the functional response only at an extraordinarily high Brachionus density (similar to 125 rotifers/mL), which by far exceeds concentrations normally encountered in the field. We conclude that con sumer-dependent food uptake by planktonic rotifers is a phenomenon that can occur under extreme conditions, but probably plays a minor role in natural environments.

AB To investigate effects of green-leaf nutrient status on senesced-leaf nutrient concentrations and resorption efficiency, we developed a database of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in green and senesced leaves from 92 published studies. We fit power functions (i.e., [nutrient](sen) = A [nutrient](gr)(B)) separately for N and P The database encompassed 297 perennial species of different life-forms. Across these divergent species and conditions, a,major control on senesced-leaf. nutrient concentration was green-leaf nutrient status; nutrient concentrations in senesced leaves were positively associated with green-leaf nutrient concentrations (r(2) values from 51% to 84%). Within-species variation as well as species differences contributed to the overall variation in nutrient concentrations. Moreover, N and P resorption efficiency decreased, respectively, with increased N and P green-leaf status; fitted power functions indicated that a disproportionate amount of nutrient remained in senesced leaves of higher green-leaf nutrient status. Functional relationships between nutrient concentrations in senesced and green leaves were in distinguishable for evergreen and deciduous species, but evergreens tended to have lower concentrations in both senesced and green leaves. General relationships (across species and environments) between. senesced- and green-leaf nutrient concentrations and broad, intraspecific variation in nutrient concentrations suggest that variation in resorption efficiency and proficiency could be a result (and not necessarily a cause) of species sorting across fertility gradients.

AB Size-based matrix models have been an important analytical tool in the study of populations. Although size can be an important variable in determining demographic parameters such as survivorship, growth, and reproduction, other factors such as genetic variation and access to resources can play key roles. We determined that size was not the only state variable that explained the survivorship, reproduction and future growth of the annual kelp, Alaria nana. A. nana shows persistent differences among individuals in growth (growth autocorrelation) that could be characterized with a negative residual (relatively poor growth) or positive residual (relatively good growth) from the relationship between size and growth. In two separate years of demographic study, we show that, during good growth conditions, growth autocorrelation is relatively strong, while poorer growth conditions associated with the 1997 El Niho event resulted in less consistency among individuals in growth state. To quantitatively describe this population, we used a size based matrix model with an added state to reflect previous growth status. We show that a matrix projection model with growth state better captures the size structure of a natural population of A. nana and the fate of individuals than one that uses only size. Without growth state, a size-based model underestimates the number of individuals that get large and thus the potential grmkth rate of the population. When we used our model to approximate among generations pattern, and included a loop analysis algorithm, we found that fast growth to the largest size class contributed greatly to population growth in the relatively good year but that there were not such obvious benefits to getting large in the EI Niho year. The sizebased model with growth state that we present here is general and applicable to any species where persistent individual differences in performance violate the first-order Markov assumption of stage- or size-based matrix models.

AB We used combined field and laboratory studies to investigate the relationships among foraging, food selection, and macronutrient intake and retention by the New Zealand marine reef fish, Girella tricuspidata (E Girellidae). Gut analyses of field-caught fish revealed a diet comprising significant proportions both of algal and non-algal (copepods, hydroids, and organic detritus) foods, with the relative proportions of algal and non-algal food items varying from 65% of non-algal foods in the winter to 34% in autumn. Observations of the diurnal feeding pattern of free-ranging wild fish showed an increase in bite rate from sunrise to late afternoon, followed by a decrease toward sunset. In laboratory studies we recorded (a) gut throughput rates, (b) macronutrient intake, and (c) macronutrient assimilation by captive G. tricuspidata fed one of three algal species. The algae were Enteromorpha intestinalis and Ulva lactuca, both of which are preferred foods of G. tricuspidata, and Gracilarid chilensis, which has not been recorded in the stomach contents of the fish despite its co-occurrence in some habitats. The two species of preferred algae were found to have a higher starch and lower protein content than the non-dietary G. chilensis. The fish regulated their intake and utilization of the algae such that similar amounts of protein were ingested and assimilated from all three species, but less starch was ingested and assimilated from the non-dietary G. chilensis than from the preferred species. Gut throughput times correlated positively with starch availability in the algae but were lower for all treatments than previous studies would suggest are associated with fermentative digestion. The data suggest that omnivory in G. tricuspidata is likely based on complementarity, rather than substitutability of algal and animal foods.

AB Individual growth rate of animals is increasingly used as an indicator of ecological stressors. Environmental contaminants often affect physiological processes within individuals, which in turn affect the animal's growth rate. Consequently, there is an increasing need to estimate parameters in physiologically based individual growth models. Here, we present a method for estimating parameters in an energetic-based individual growth model (a dynamic energy budget model). This model is a system of stochastic differential equations in which one of the state variables (the energy reserve) is unobservable. There is no analytical solution to the probability density of size at given age, so we use a numerical nonlinear state-space method to calculate the likelihood. An algorithm to calculate the likelihood is outlined in this paper. This method is general enough to apply to other stochastic differential equation models. We assessed the estimability of parameters in the individual growth model, and analyzed size trajectory data from delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). We expect this method to become an important tool in ecological studies as computers become faster, as the models that we deal with become more complex, and as the data that we collect become more detailed.

AB Isolation of remnant forest patches, coupled with anthropogenic changes in the surrounding landscape, often leads to changes in the population density of forest-dwelling mammals. At Pasoh Forest Reserve in Peninsular Malaysia, densities of native wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are 10-100 times greater than historical levels due to the local extinction of feline predators and the presence of abundant food sources in areas adjacent to the forest. Female pigs build reproductive nests out of understory vegetation; at Pasoh these nests are constructed primarily of woody saplings several meters tall that pigs snap or uproot, causing substantial local damage. We documented the prevalence of nest building by pigs at Pasoh within a 25-ha area from 1995 to 1998 and investigated the impacts of this mammalian behavior on the understory plant community. In total, 643 pig nests were enumerated, providing an estimate that 6.0 nests(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1) were constructed in the survey area. Pigs avoided constructing nests adjacent to trails but otherwise built nests throughout the 25-ha survey area. A single pig nest contained, on average, 267 +/- 86 (mean +/- I SD) woody saplings, of which 45% had been uprooted and 55% had the main stem snapped. The understory area affected by the construction of a single pig nest averaged 244 +/- 112 m(2), with 53% of all free-standing woody plants >= 70 cm tall and < 2.0 cm dbh in this area being uprooted or snapped. As a result of nest building, pigs caused an estimated 29% of the observed tree mortality of saplings 1-2 cm dbh, and 43% of sapling mortality and damage combined. Pigs affected plant families differently, with individuals from the economically and ecologically paramount Dipterocarpaceae being about two times more likely to be used in nest construction than other taxa. Our results indicate that pig nest-building activities are a major source of sapling mortality, and that their effects probably will result in substantial shifts in tree community composition in this forest.

AB Many species with complex life histories can respond to risk by adaptively altering the timing of key life history switch points, including hatching. It is generally thought that such hatching plasticity involves a trade-off between embryonic and hatchling predation risk, e.g., hatching early to escape egg predation comes at the cost of increased vulnerability to hatchling predators. However, most empirical work has focused on simply detecting predator- induced hatching responses or on the short-term consequences of hatching plasticity. Short-term studies may not allow sufficient time for hatchlings to exhibit compensatory responses, which may extend to subsequent life stages and could alter the nature of the trade-offs associated with hatching plasticity. In this study, we examine the consequences of predator-induced hatching plasticity through the larval stage to metamorphosis in the East African reed frog, Hyperolius spinigularis. To do this we conducted an experiment in which we manipulated initial larval size and density (mimicking the effects of egg predators) and the presence of aquatic predators. We expected that predator-induced hatchlings (because they are less developed and smaller) would experience higher per capita predation rates and a longer larval period and thus would exhibit lower survival to metamorphosis in the presence of aquatic predators than larger, more developed, later hatched larvae. Surprisingly, we found that predator- induced hatchlings survived better, not worse, than hatchlings from undisturbed clutches. These results motivated us to develop a model parameterized from additional experiments to explore whether a combination of mechanisms, compensatory growth, and density- and size-specific predation, could give rise to this pattern. Predicted survival probabilities from the model with compensatory growth were consistent with those from the field experiment: early hatched larvae grew more rapidly through vulnerable size classes than later hatched larvae, resulting in higher survival at metamorphosis. Thus, in this system, there does not appear to be a trade-off in vulnerability between egg and larval predators. Instead, our results suggest that the cost that balances the survival benefit of hatching early to evade egg predators arises later in the life history, as a result of smaller size at metamorphosis.

AB Inbreeding in the form of self-fertilization is widespread among plants and typically results in broad, detrimental changes in plant morphology and physiology. Phenotypic changes associated with inbreeding are likely to alter interactions between inbred plants and other organisms, but few studies have investigated this potential. We found that inbreeding in the entire-leaf morning glory, Ipomoea hederacea var. integriuscula, altered this plant's ability to resist and tolerate attack by insect herbivores. The effects of inbreeding on plant defense, however, varied among insect species, and plant defense theory helped explain this variation. If the effects of inbreeding on plant phenotype are analogous to those of environmental stresses, then the plant vigor hypothesis predicts specialist herbivores will perform better on outbred plants, and the plant stress hypothesis predicts that generalist herbivores will perform better on inbred plants. We conducted a series of greenhouse experiments in which we reared two species of specialist tortoise beetles, a generalist moth species, and a generalist aphid species on inbred and outbred morning glories to test these hypotheses. We found that specialist tortoise beetles performed significantly better when reared on outbred plants and that aphid populations grew significantly faster on inbred plants as predicted by the plant vigor and plant stress hypotheses, respectively. Beet armyworni caterpillars, however, performed better oil outbred plants, not inbred plants as predicted. These results suggest that plant defense theories may be Useful for predicting the effects of inbreeding on plant-herbivore interactions, but differences in herbivore feeding habit (leaf chewing vs. phloern feeding) may also help explain variation in the effects of plant inbreeding on insect herbivores.

AB We have long known that corvids are adaptively flexible in behavior, but have rarely tested their flexibility and creativity in solving problems outside the laboratory. Through a carefully controlled experiment conducted in the wild, I have found that Common Ravens (Corvus corax) fly toward gunshot sounds, presumably in order to locate animal aut piles left by hunters. This is the first conclusive evidence of any scavenger species pursuing gunshots. Furthermore, ravens exhibited this behavior only when gunshots were fired from within forested habitat, when the shots may be most valuable to them for locating gut piles. Interestingly, raven behaviors suggest that they may have learned the usefulness of gunshots by substituting them for other previously known sounds already used to locate food in the wild.

AB Lakes may have alternative states due to excessive phosphorus, (P) input: a clear-water state and turbid one with high chlorophyll concentrations. Because shifts between these states have large ecosystem effects, and restoration after the shifts is costly or sometimes impossible, precise evaluation of the possibility of alternative states is needed for lake management. Yet the shifts are quite variable and seem to depend on many factors, including lake morphometry, temperature, and dominance of macrophytes. Here we evaluated the role of these factors using an empirically based model that included more mechanistic detail than earlier models of regime shifts in trophic state. Mean depth and temperature strongly influenced the susceptibility of lakes to regime shifts and lake restoration. The macrophyte effect of preventing P recycling from sediments was critical to the susceptibility of shallow lakes to regime shift. With warmer temperatures, eutrophication was more likely and restoration was less successful due to increased internal P recycling from the sediment. Lakes with intermediate depths were most susceptible to regime shifts and were least restorable. These lakes were too deep to be protected by macrophytes in their littoral zones and were too shallow to mitigate P recycling through hypolimnetic dilution. Our results illustrated the interplay of multiple physical, chemical, and biotic mechanisms in regime shifts, a complex type of causality that may arise in regime shifts of other types of ecosystems.

AB Although the mid-domain effect (MDE) model for species richness in bounded geographical domains has proved controversial, several studies have revealed its explanatory potential for patterns of species richness. This paper investigates unexplored aspects of one-dimensional MDE, based on a data set of latitudinal distributions of New World birds (3706 species) on a V scale. Two previously published data sets for other taxa are also considered. We adjusted band sums (number of species per latitudinal band) for longitudinal area by constructing species-area curves for each band. Area-corrected richness patterns differed substantially from raw band sums, although both confirmed a strong, mid-tropical peak in richness. An MDE model accounted for 47% of the adjusted pattern, whereas area alone explained 13% of variation. Area-adjusted band sum data proved preferable to coastal transect data from the same data set. MDE was relatively more important in smaller latitudinal domains and/or for taxa with relatively large ranges. On fundamental grounds, we concluded that MDE randomizations based on empirical ranges are more appropriate than those based on theoretical range size distributions. Models that, like MDE, produce quantitative richness predictions should be evaluated statistically against the null hypothesis of equality, not simply correlation, of empirical vs. predicted richness values.

AB Introduced species frequently escape the natural enemies (predators, competitors, and parasites) that limit their distribution and abundance in the native range. This reduction in native predators, competitors, and parasites may result in ecological release in the introduced range. However, biological interactions also can limit the establishment and spread of normative populations. The extent to which such biotic resistance occurs is poorly resolved., especially for marine ecosystems. Here we test whether a native predator, the blue crab Callinectes sapidus, affects the abundance and geographic range of the introduced European green crab Carcinus maenas in eastern North America. Both crab species occur in shallow, soft-sediment habitats of bays and estuaries, and their ranges overlap in eastern North America. First, we tested for a negative relationship in the abundances of the two species from trap samples across a 640-km (5.78 degrees latitude) coastal transect. Second, we estimated variation in predation pressure on tethered Carcinus maenas across latitude and as a function of Callinectes sapidus abundance. Third, we measured predation rates on Carcinus maenas by Callinectes sapidus in field and laboratory experiments. Our results support the hypothesis that the native predator Callinectes sapidus provides biotic resistance to invasion and prevents the southward spread and establishment of Carcinus maenas. Within and across bays, Carcinus maenas were significantly less abundant at sites and depths with Callinectes sapidus compared with areas lacking Callinectes sapidus. Moreover, no Carcinus maenas were found in Chesapeake Bay, where Callinectes sapidus were most abundant. Predation of tethered Carcinus maenas increased with Callinectes sapidus abundance. In laboratory and field experiments, Callinectes sapidus preyed readily on Carcinus maenas. Thus, we conclude the predation by Callinectes sapidus, alone or in combination with other factors, limits the abundance and geographic range of an invasive marine species.

AB Periodical cicadas present numerous puzzles for biologists. First, their period is fixed, with individuals emerging as adults precisely after either 13 or 17 years (depending on species). Second, even when there are multiple species of either 13- or 17-year cicadas at the same location, only one or rarely two broods (cohorts) co-occur, so that periodical cicada adults appear episodically. Third, the 13- or 17-year periods of cicadas suggest there is something important about prime numbers. Finally, single broods can dominate large areas, with geographical boundaries of broods remaining generally stable through time.
   While previous mathematical models have been used to investigate some of these puzzles individually, here we investigate them all simultaneously. Unlike previous models, we take an explicitly evolutionary approach. Although not enough information is known about periodical cicadas to draw firm conclusions, the theoretical arguments favor a combination of predator satiation and nymph competition as being key to the evolution of strictly fixed periods and occurrence of only one brood at most geographical locations. Despite ecological mechanisms that. can select for strictly fixed periods, there seem to be no plausible ecological mechanisms that select for periods being prime numbers. This suggests that the explanation for prime-numbered periods, rather than just fixed periods, may reside in physiological or genetic mechanisms or constraints.

AB The change in avian clutch size with latitude is a celebrated example of geographic variation in a vertebrate life-history trait. Alternative hypotheses for this pattern invoke nest predation, limited food for nestlings, or post-fledging juvenile mortality as selection pressures leading to small clutch size of tropical birds. We manipulated the clutch size of Spotted Antbirds (Hylophylax naevioides) in central Panama to test these hypotheses. We observed that rates of nest predation were not influenced by parental activity at nests and parents could successfully feed nestlings in enlarged broods. Although larger broods produced the most fledged juveniles, these individuals were less likely to survive to dispersal than were juveniles that fledged from smaller broods. Consequently, nest productivity did not vary with clutch size. Post-fledging mortality was not related to nestling mass two to three days prior to fledging. Rather, differences in the allocation of parental investment per juvenile among differently sized broods appeared to influence juvenile survival probability. These results identify parental care during the post-fledging period as a potential key factor influencing the evolution of small clutch size in tropical birds.

AB Remotely sensed tracking data collected on animal movement is vastly underutilized due to a lack of statistical tools for appropriate analysis. Features of such data that make analysis particularly challenging include the presence of estimation errors that are non-Gaussian and vary in time, observations that occur irregularly in time, and complexity in the underlying behavioral processes. We develop a state-space framework that simultaneously deals with these features and demonstrate our method by analyzing three seal pathway data sets. We show how known information regarding error distributions can be used to improve inference of the underlying process(es) and demonstrate that our framework provides a powerful and flexible method for fitting different behavioral models to tracking data.

AB Exotic plant species can affect native plant species both directly via competition and indirectly by modifying native species' interactions with other organisms in the community. Both direct and indirect effects can have strong fitness impacts on the native species and can result in cascading effects throughout the invaded community. Many exotic plant species escape from the herbivores with which they co-evolved, but in our study system, the exotic Egyptian alfalfa weevil (Hypera brunneipennis) has been introduced to California and is able to feed both on the exotic plant Medicago polymorpha and on the California native Lotus wrangelianus. Because these two plant species share this common herbivore, the possibility of strong herbivore-mediated indirect interactions between these introduced and native plant species is plausible.
   We used observational studies and manipulative field experiments to determine whether exotic Medicago affects herbivory on the native Lotus and whether Medicago reduces the fitness of Lotus through direct competitive effects and/or herbivore-mediated indirect effects. Both observational and experimental data indicate that Medicago increases weevil herbivory on the native Lotus. Additionally, Medicago reduced Lotus fitness through direct as well as indirect mechanisms. In 2002, Medicago reduced Lotus fitness even when herbivores were experimentally reduced, suggesting direct competitive effects of Medicago on the native Lotus. In contrast, in 2003, Medicago reduced Lotus fitness only in the presence of herbivores, indicating that the fitness effects in that year were largely indirect and mediated by herbivores. Our results demonstrate that the net fitness consequences of indirect and direct effects of exotic plant species on native plants can vary temporally, depending on the abundance of members of the herbivore community. Also, rather than limiting the success of exotics, introduced herbivores that feed on exotic plants may provide additional, indirect avenues through which exotic plants can reduce the fitness of native species.

AB Recent models and analyses of paleoecological records suggest that tree populations are capable of rapid migration when climate warms. Fossil pollen is commonly interpreted as suggesting that the range of many temperate tree species expanded at rates of 100-1000 m/yr during the early Holocene. We used chloroplast DNA surveys to show that the geography of postglacial range expansion in two eastern North American tree species differs from that expected from pollen-based reconstructions and from patterns emerging from European molecular studies. Molecular evidence suggests that American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and red maple (Acer rubrum) persisted during the late glaciation as low-density populations, perhaps within 500 km of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Because populations were closer to modern range limits than previously thought, postglacial migration rates may have been slower than those inferred from fossil pollen. Our estimated rates of < 100 m/yr are consistent with model predictions based on life history and dispersal data, and suggest that past migration rates were substantially slower than the rates that will be needed to track 21st-century warming.

AB It is relatively easy to document direct agonistic interactions among or within species that lead to exclusion of subordinate animals from preferred habitats. It is more difficult to measure the competitive effects of that exclusion on the "loser." Thus, much behavioral research assumes that the intensity of agonistic interactions is correlated with their cost to performance, but does not directly measure such a cost. We examined fitness-associated traits of pregnant viviparous scincid lizards (Eulaniprus hearwolei) in outdoor enclosures under three conditions: alone, with a conspecific, or with a larger and more aggressive heterospecific (Egernia saxatilis, a sympatric scincid species). As in previous laboratory studies, Egernia saxatilis attacked Eulamprits heatwolei and excluded individuals of the smaller species from warmer shelter sites. However, Eulamprus heatwolei were able to maintain "normal" schedules of body temperatures and food intake, apparently by modifying their behavior to minimize encounters with their aggressive cage mates. Accordingly, the subordinate animals showed no overt ill effects in spite of strong agonistic interactions: the body condition, locomotor performance, and corticosterone levels of subordinate Eulamprus housed with Egernia were indistinguishable from those of lizards kepi in solitary cages or with conspecifics only. Similarly, the offspring of these pregnant females were born at the same time, and with similar phenotypic traits, as the offspring of control females. Thus, even in situations of intense interspecific aggression and consequent habitat exclusion, behavioral flexibility of the subordinate animals may decrease or eliminate the inferred ecological consequences of that interaction.

AB Environmental temperature can modify not only rates of ectotherm growth, development, and reproduction, but also, at the extremes, temperature can limit survivorship and ultimately fitness. We: studied ectotherm populations from a latitudinal gradient to understand how alterations in the thermal environment (e.g., rapid climate change) may affect the persistence of populations experiencing stress-induced mortality. Populations of the mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, from 30-50 degrees N in North America were subjected to heat and cold stress based on observed field temperatures during the simulated passage of a typical 4-5 d warm- or cold-weather front. Cold but not heat tolerance corresponded to latitude of origin, reflecting previously observed patterns in year-long fitness. Both heat and cold stress resulted in an average of 44% mortality relative to unstressed controls but did not result in a significant loss of fitness (R-0) at the population level. We conclude that individuals most likely to survive during periods of stress are also the individuals most likely to make the greatest contribution to the next generation in the absence of stress. Since individual survivorship must, at some level, become limiting to population viability, these results imply that apparently viable populations may be pushed rapidly to extinction by a small increment in environmental stress.

AB Many studies of postdispersal seed fate use seed removal as an index of seed predation. However, following primary seed dispersal, some seeds are transported intact by ants, dung beetles,, scatter-hoarding animals, or abiotic processes to new microsites (secondary dispersal) where germination is possible. Despite a growing realization that secondary seed dispersal can play an important role in plant recruitment, many researchers continue to use seed removal as a proxy for seed predation and are focused too intently on only the initial step of seed fate. We describe, using examples from the recent literature, how the results of some seed removal studies may have been misinterpreted, present plausible, alternative explanations for the fate of seeds in those studies, and discuss the importance of detailed studies of seed fates. Following the fates of seeds can be difficult, but such studies contribute much more to our understanding of seed dynamics and plant fitness.

AB The amount and spatial distribution of deep drainage (downward movement of water across the bottom of the root zone) and groundwater recharge affect the quantity and quality of increasingly limited groundwater in arid and semiarid regions. We synthesize research from the fields of ecology and hydrology to address the issue of deep drainage in and and semiarid regions. We start with a recently developed hydrological model that accurately simulates soil water potential and geochemical profiles measured in thick (>50 m), unconsolidated vadose zones. Model results indicate that, since the climate change that marked the onset of the Holocene period 10000-15000 years ago, there has been no deep drainage in vegetated interdrainage areas and that continuous, relatively low (<-1 MPa) soil water potentials have been maintained at depths of 2-3 m. A conceptual model consistent with these results proposes that the native, xeric-shrub-dominated, plant communities that gained dominance during the Holocene generated and maintained these conditions. We present three lines of ecological evidence that support the conceptual model. First, xeric shrubs have sufficiently deep rooting systems with low extraction limits to generate the modeled conditions. Second, the characteristic deep-rooted soil-plant systems store sufficient water to effectively buffer deep soil from climatic fluctuations in these dry environments, allowing stable conditions to persist for long periods of time. And third, adaptations resulting in deep, low-extraction-limit rooting systems confer significant advantages to xeric shrubs in and and semiarid environments. We then consider conditions in arid and semiarid regions in which the conceptual model may not apply, leading to the expectation that portions of many arid and semiarid watersheds supply some deep drainage. Further ecohydrologic research is required to elucidate critical climatic and edaphic thresholds, evaluate the role of important physiological processes (Such as hydraulic redistribution), and evaluate the role of deep roots in terms of carbon costs, nutrient uptake, and whole-plant development.

AB A long-term study of tree mortality, canopy turnover, and coarse woody detritus inputs was conducted in cove forests of the Great Smoky Mountains, Tennessee, USA. Seven old-growth stands were studied over a 10-yr period using 0.6-1.0 ha plots. Annual mortality of trees >10 cm dbh was 0.5-1.4% among stands (mean 0.7%). The highest mortality rate among canopy trees was exhibited by trees >80 cm dbh. An increase in mortality rate with canopy tree size was evident for two (Tsuga canadensis and Acer saccharum) of the three most abundant species in the forest. The increase in mortality with tree size had implications for canopy turnover and detritus input. Gap disturbance frequency was estimated at 0.008-0.019 forest area/yr, giving a return interval of similar to130 yr or less. Standing death was the most common mode of mortality (59%). Annual fates of snag formation were 1.4 snags/ha for trees >10 cm dbh and 0.4 snags/ha for trees >50 cm dbh. The density of large snags (>50 cm dbh) was 5 snags/ha. Snags accounted for 8% of the total standing tree basal area and 23% of the coarse woody detritus mass (total of 48 Mg/ha). The mean annual rate of coarse woody detritus input was 3.0 Mg/ha. A decay rate constant was estimated at 0.07, yielding a detritus half-life of 10 yr. Although mean mortality rates and canopy turnover in old cove forests were moderate in comparison with other old forests of eastern North America, input and accumulation of coarse woody detritus were high for the region. This resulted, in part, from the relatively large sizes attained by canopy trees and the fact that larger trees tended to suffer higher mortality. In comparison to forests worldwide, rates of mortality, canopy gap formation, and decay of coarse woody detritus were intermediate.

AB I examined the effect of repeated long-fallow shifting cultivation on biomass accumulation in a rain-forest landscape occupied for over 200 years in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, The diameters of stems >5 cm dbh were measured in nine secondary forests using a stratified random design of nested plots (3000 m(2) per site). The stands were 9-12 years old and had experienced from I to 10 or more cycles of shifting cultivation. Accounting for differences in soil fertility, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) demonstrated that aboveground live biomass increment (ABI, in megagrams per hectare per year) was significantly greater after four cycles than after six or more cycles. ABI was lowest after two cycles, highest after one or four cycles and intermediate after 6-10 cycles. Differences were driven by the density and biomass of trees >10 cm dbh, which followed a similar pattern. Although the diameter increment and contribution to total biomass of trees >10 cm dbh increased significantly with inherent soil fertility, variation in the rate of biomass accumulation depended primarily on the number of prior cultivation cycles. An ANCOVA with soil fertility as the main effect was not significant. One hypothesis to explain observed patterns of ABI associated with changes in tree density is a shift, over many cycles, in the dominance of seed-banking vs. resprouting species. Previous work has shown that total phosphorus did not decline after six or more cycles; however, a shift from available to occluded forms may be related to lower ABI in sites with the longest cultivation history. An 11% decline in ABI could substantially alter the carbon-sequestration value of secondary tropical forests as they enter their second century of persistent human disturbance.

AB Ingestion of plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) presents a physiological and behavioral challenge for mammalian herbivores. Herbivores must not only detoxify PSMs, but they may also deal with energetic constraints such as reduced food intake, mass loss, increased excretion of energy, and increased metabolic demands. We hypothesized that the energetic consequences of consuming PSMs will significantly compromise apparent metabolizable energy intake (AMEI) and energy expenditure in mammalian herbivores. Furthermore, we hypothesized that foraging strategy would influence the degree to which plant consumption impacts energy budgets, such that dietary specialists would be less impacted than generalists when both are consuming the plant species preferred by the specialist. Hypotheses were tested by comparing AMEI and energy expended on basal metabolic rate (BMR) and locomotion in a juniper specialist (Neotoma stephensi) and generalist (N. albigula) woodrat fed control diet and diet containing juniper foliage (Juniperus iperus monosperma). In general, the intake of PSMs in juniper increased the energy excreted in urine and feces in both specialist and generalist. woodrats. Specialist woodrats minimized the costs associated with the intake of juniper by ingesting more juniper diet, thereby increasing energy intake, and reducing energy expended on BMR and locomotor activity. Generalist woodrats also decreased locomotor activity on a juniper diet but did not increase intake and maintained BMR. In turn, specialist woodrats had twice as much energy available for activities such as reproduction when consuming a juniper diet than generalists. These results suggest that the intake of PSMs impinges on AMEI and compromises energy expenditure, but that the impact of PSMs on energy budgets is relative to ecological experience with PSMs. Moreover, compensatory feeding, metabolic depression, and low activity may be strategies employed by specialist woodrats that can mitigate the cost of processing PSMs, but these strategies may be constrained in generalist woodrats.

AB Amphibian populations at the Savannah River Site (SRS), South Carolina, USA, have been censused consistently for 35 years, and this Provides a time series to examine the causes Of Population fluctuations. We examined archived museum specimens of 15 anuran species collected at wetlands on the SRS for the presence of the causative agent (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) of chytridiomycosis, an emerging disease associated with population declines elsewhere. Infections were present in three out of 137 (2.18%) individuals; the pathogen was detected in two Rana catesbeiana and a single Rana sphenocephala, all collected between 1978 and 1981. Lesions were not consistent with the later stages of fatal chytridiomycosis. Analysis of population trajectories of nine amphibian species over 26 years at SRS showed that four species declined significantly over this period, including R. sphenocephala. However, we demonstrate that these declines are more likely caused by an increase in the number of years with insufficient rainfall and a shortened hydroperiod at the breeding site than by chytrid epidemics. This pattern appears to be linked to a drying trend at SRS through the 1990s, although it is unclear whether this was caused by climate change. This study demonstrates that the presence of B. dendrobatidis in amphibian communities where some species are declining does not always implicate chytrids as a cause of the decline. Like many other emerging pathogens, the outcome of infection can vary among individuals and populations, depending on life history traits, environmental conditions, and virulence factors of the pathogen. Our report also demonstrates the usefulness of archived museum specimens and long-term population monitoring in studying the host-parasite ecology of emerging diseases.

AB Strong but relatively short (annual to decadal length) climate change can have broad-scale and long-lasting effects on forest communities. Climate impacts forests through direct effects on tree demography (mortality and overstory recruitment) and indirect effects on disturbance regimes. Here, we compare multicentury chronologies of tree recruitment from a 307-ha ponderosa pine forest in southwestern Colorado to reconstructions of fire years, hydroclimate, and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Few trees predate a regional multiyear megadrought centered in the 1580s. A prolonged pluvial in the early-1600s resulted in a pulse of tree recruitment that corresponds to recruitment seen over much of the Southwest. Other cohorts in the early 1700s and mid-1800s established during multidecadal fire-quiescent periods. These periods correspond to shifts in ENSO that apparently resulted in dampening of interannual wet/dry oscillations responsible for fuel buildup and drying. Fires, mediated by stochastic climate variation, acted as a density-independent regulation on tree populations since establishment was not limited by overstory tree density, but rather by fire-caused mortality of seedlings and saplings during periods of more frequent fires. Even-aged cohorts in ponderosa pine forests likely have little if anything to do with episodic mortality caused by more severe fires, but rather relate mainly to episodic recruitment opportunities. Fire cessation after Euro-American settlement in the late 1800s resulted in an increase in tree density and changes in forest composition, which are major factors that have contributed to recent severe wildfires in other Southwestern forests. Our results document clear linkages between synoptic climate forcing, fires, and recruitment episodes, and highlight the importance of regional historical processes on contemporary forest composition and structure.

AB We analyzed seed production of mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) forest along an elevational gradient in New Zealand from 1020 to 1370 m (treeline) for the years 1973-2002. We used seed production data from nine elevations and a site- and species-specific net carbon (C) availability model from two elevations (1050 in and 1340 IT) to examine how three variables (temperature, soil moisture, and net C availability) during three key periods (resource priming, flowering primordia development, and flowering) influence seed production. These three strongly interrelated variables have all been considered determinants of seed production but have not previously been tested together in a single analysis. Seed production increased over the 30-year period, with the greatest increases at high elevations; this increase was driven by a greater frequency of intermediate- sized seeding years. We then determined how temperature, soil moisture, and net C availability determined seeding, and examined whether temporal trends in the seeding data could be linked to similar temporal trends in temperature, soil moisture, or net C availability. High seed production was related to cool summers with high soil moisture during resource priming, warm summers during flower primordia development, and low net C availability during flowering. Positive temporal trends in temperatures during the period of flower primordia development accounted for the increase in seed production, suggesting that increasing temperatures are promoting more frequent seed production at high elevations.

AB Although there is clear evidence that climate change influences ecological patterns and processes, scientists do not agree on the importance of climate in causing ecological change. Part of the problem is finding large-scale ecological response patterns that are unbiased and unconfounded estimators of the effects of climate change. Here we present evidence that the 1997/1998 El Nino event, associated in 1998 with the highest global surface temperature since 1860, caused synchronous variation in radial increment growth of the main roots of perennial forb species in the United States and in Switzerland. Our a posteriori analysis of annual ring width fluctuations indicates that growth of herbaceous plants responds rapidly and sensitively to climatic fluctuation, while the direction and strength of the response depends on interactions with local conditions. We suggest that analysis of growth rings in the roots of forbs provides a widely applicable approach to detecting effects of both strong global climate variation and regionally limited extreme climatic events on herbaceous vegetation. This new technique of "herb-chronology" thus helps ecologists to evaluate how competitive balance between plant species in herbaceous vegetation might respond to climate change, with consequences for ecosystem function and diversity.

AB The diversity and composition of a community are determined by a combination of local and regional processes. We conducted a field experiment to examine the impact of resource manipulations and seed addition on the invasibility and diversity of a low-productivity grassland. We manipulated resource levels both by a disturbance treatment that reduced adult plant cover in the spring of the first year and by addition of fertilizer every year. Seeds of 46 native species, both resident and nonresident to the community,,were added in spring of the first year to determine the effects of recruitment limitation from local (seed limitation) and regional (dispersal limitation) sources on local species richness. Our results show that the unmanipulated community was not readily invasible. Seed addition increased the species richness of unmanipulated plots, but this was primarily due to increased occurrence of resident species. Nonresident species were only able to invade following a cover-reduction disturbance.
   Cover reduction resulted in an increase in nitrogen availability in the first year, but had no measurable effect on light availability in any year. In contrast, fertilization created a persistent increase in nitrogen availability that increased plant cover or biomass and reduced light penetration to ground level. Initially, fertilization had an overall positive effect on species richness, but by the third year, the effect was either negative or neutral. Unlike cover reduction, fertilization had no observable effect on seedling recruitment or occurrence (number of plots) of invading resident or nonresident species. The results of our experiment demonstrate that, although resource fluctuations can increase the invasibility of this grassland, the community response depends on the nature of the resource change.

ID CLASSIFICATION; SERIATION; TABLES
AB Block clustering and seriation reveal the underlying structure of ecological data structures by rearranging the rows and the columns of the data table or data matrix, usually representing species and sample sites, respectively. Classical approaches to this problem rely upon a goodness criterion optimized through an iterative algorithm or utilize a simultaneous classification or ordination of species and sites. The new procedure introduced here does not strive for a single optimal rearrangement. Instead, it generates a series of probability distributions, the Boltzmann distributions, for a large set of solutions that include both the optimal and suboptimal solutions. The procedure is governed by a hypothetical parameter, T, called the "temperature." For the value of zero, only the best rearrangements (if there are many) have nonzero probabilities. As the value of this parameter increases, less optimal rearrangements become more frequent in the associated series of distributions. When T approaches infinity, the distribution becomes uniform over all the possible matrix. rearrangements. We propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method which converges reasonably fast to this distribution for any value of T. This chain provides a sample of matrices that can be characterized via several statistics based on the Boltzmann distribution.
   The relevance of the method is demonstrated using ecological data. We illustrate how much extra information can be gained from suboptimal solutions that may have biological meaning not revealed by the best solution. Although the objective is to give a distribution of solutions rather than a single optimal solution, the new method can actually outperform heuristic searching algorithms in finding the best arrangement.
   We provide source code for the MCMC method in the C language, which can be compiled under many operating systems (Windows, Linux/Unix, Macintosh OS) and used in command line mode. The Linux/Unix version operates in interactive mode, it gives a graphical output of the results, and is available as a web server interface in PHP 4.3, which can also be installed on personal computers.

ID NEW-ZEALAND AVIFAUNA; REDUNDANCY
AB The probability of a bird species going extinct on oceanic islands in the period since European colonization is predicted by the number of introduced predatory mammal species, but the exact mechanism driving this relationship is unknown. One possibility is that larger exotic predator communities include a wider array of predator functional types. These predator communities may target native bird species with a wider range of behavioral or life history characteristics. We explored the hypothesis that the functional diversity of the exotic predators drives bird species extinctions. We also tested how different combinations of functionally important traits of the predators explain variation in extinction probability. Our results suggest a unique impact of each introduced mammal species on native bird populations, as opposed to a situation where predators exhibit functional redundancy. Further, the impact of each additional predator may be facilitated by those already present, suggesting the possibility of "invasional meltdown."

AB To evaluate effects of river inputs on estuarine phytoplankton, we compared particulate organic matter (POM) dynamics in two neighboring estuaries from the Mississippi River delta. The two estuaries, Barataria Basin and Breton Sound, have been isolated from the Mississippi River at their upstream ends for most of the last century due to levee construction, but for the last 13 years, Breton Sound has been reconnected to the Mississippi River via a gated diversion at Caernarvon, Louisiana. Thus, Barataria Basin was the reference estuary and Breton Sound was the river-impacted estuary. We focused on POM because it was relatively easy to collect and analyze, and because POM dynamics gave a good ecosystem-level overview of phytoplankton responses to riverine nutrient forcing and hydrologic forcing. A combination of C:N and (POC)-C-13 analyses indicated that most POM was phytoplankton with smaller contributions of sediment. Estuarine concentrations of particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PON) were typically higher than end-member freshwater or marine inputs, indicating the importance of within-system phytoplankton growth likely fueled by rapid nutrient regeneration in these warm, shallow and well-mixed estuarine systems. Isotopic analyses generally showed typical estuarine gradients in the reference Barataria Basin estuary, but the river-influenced upper Breton Sound had elevated (POC)-C-13 and (PON)-N-15 values useful for following the spatial extent of river impacts. Rapid river-assisted flushing in Breton Sound probably prevented widespread development of algal blooms in response to introductions of the nutrient-rich river water, but study of some isolated lakes suggested that when longer residence times apply, introduction of river water to coastal estuaries can lead to eutrophic conditions and in some cases, harmful algal blooms. Overall, routinely monitoring amounts and isotopic compositions of POM proved an effective way to trace linkages between river inputs and downstream estuarine phytoplankton dynamics.

AB At northern high latitudes, biosphere responses to and interactions with climate warming are expected to be significant during the 21st century. Most predictions of climate-biosphere interactions rely on experiments and observations in contemporary landscapes, e.g., modern distributions of vegetation types and their structural features are used to delimit potential biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks. Paleorecords look beyond the present to examine vegetation configurations under climatic regimes that approximate future scenarios. To enhance the knowledge of arctic and subarctic ecosystems under varying climatic conditions, we analyzed pollen and macrofossil data from Beringia (northeast Siberia, Alaska, and northwest Canada; 130 degrees E to 130 degrees W) over the past 21000 years, with a focus on structural and functional features of the vegetation. During the early Holocene (similar to 13 000-10 000 cal yr BP), shrub tundra ecosystems responded to climate warming through a shift from shrub tundra to deciduous forest or woodland. Early-Holocene vegetation was structurally, and hence functionally, novel compared with today's dominant vegetation types. "Modern" boreal forest developed in the mid-Holocene (similar to 10 000-6000 cal yr BP), when evergreen conifers expanded in much of the region. The shift from tundra to deciduous forest could have happened rapidly and in situ as the result of individual (phenotypic) and/or population-scale responses to climate warming. Because the structural and functional properties of deciduous forest differ from those of evergreen coniferous forest and tundra, deciduous boreal forest should be included in the range of future scenarios used to assess the probable feedbacks of vegetation to the climatic system that result from global warming at northern high latitudes.

AB A common concern when designing surveys for rare species is ensuring sufficient detections for analytical purposes, such as estimating frequency on the landscape or modeling habitat relationships. Strict design-based approaches provide the least biased estimates but often result in low detection rates of rare species. Here, we demonstrate how model-based stratification can improve the probability of detecting five rare epiphytic macrolichens (Nephroma laevigatum, N. occultum, N. parile, Lobaria scrobiculataa, and Psuedocyphelaria rainierensis) in the Pacific Northwest. We constructed classification tree models for four more common lichens (L. oregana, L. pulmonaria, P. anomala, and P. anthraspis) that are associated with the rare species, then used the models to generate strata for sampling for the five lichen species considered rare. The classification tree models were developed using topographic and bio-climatic variables hypothesized to have direct relationships to the presence of the modeled lichen species. When the expected detection rates using the model-based stratification approach was tested on an independent data set, it resulted in two- to fivefold gains in detection compared to the observed detection rates for four of the five tested rare species.

AB The hormone corticosterone is an important part of animals ' response to environmental stress, modulating short-term adaptive changes in behavior and physiology. The hormone testosterone is also critical, especially for males, in regulating the expression of sexual behavior and parental care. These hormones can have costly consequences, however, and within populations individuals show variation in endogenous levels of both corficosterone and testosterone. We studied how annual survival varied as a function of natural levels of these hormones in colonially breeding Cliff Swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) in southwestern Nebraska, USA, in 2000-2003. We sampled hormone levels of birds caught at colonies and using mark-recapture, monitored their survival through subsequent years in the study area. Maximum-likelihood estimation and model fitting (with program MARK) revealed that birds sampled for corticosterone in colonies of all sizes late in the season had curvilinear survival; individuals with very low and very high levels of corticosterone had lower survival than those with intermediate levels. Annual survival of birds sampled earlier in the season, however, generally declined with increasing corticosterone level. More birds than expected, given the survival functions, had the very low corticosterone levels in nonfumigated colonies later in the year, suggesting perhaps a compensatory benefit unrelated to survival for very low corticosterone levels. In a more limited analysis, testosterone appeared to have little effect on annual survival, although some evidence suggested that females with endogenous testosterone levels below the mean for a given date might have survived better.

AB Physiological processes are optimized within a narrow range of body temperatures. Reptiles engage in behavioral thermoregulation to achieve the optimal body temperature range. Interestingly, however, thermoregulatory effort varies over time and across species. The cost-benefit model of thermoregulation of R. B. Huey and M. Slatkin is the only conceptual framework that attempts to explain the observed variation. The model postulates that reptiles should engage in thermoregulation when the costs incurred do not outweigh the benefits. The main cost is the thermal quality of the environment: thermoregulation is more costly in habitats of low thermal quality. We used thermal quality of the habitat, measured by the deviations of operative temperatures from the preferred body temperature range, as an indicator of costs and two quantitative indices of thermoregulation as indices of thermoregulatory investment. Regressions of the indices of thermoregulation on thermal quality of the habitat produced no pattern or patterns that were in the opposite direction to the predictions of the cost-benefit model of thermoregulation. These results suggest that the disadvantages of thermoconformity are higher than the costs of thermoregulation in habitats of low thermal quality.

AB Investigation of host-parasite interactions typically reveals a negative impact of parasitism on the host species. In contrast, mounting evidence indicates that bot fly (Cuterebra sp.) infestation enhances the survival of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus). We propose that life history trade-offs, namely, between reproduction and survival, can explain this counterintuitive observation. By using an extensive data set spanning a decade, 12 sites in two states, and over 30 000 mouse captures, we offer a new perspective on the effects of hot fly parasitism on white-footed mice. Analysis of persistence time corroborated earlier studies that showed significantly higher survival-rates of infested mice. Although a higher proportion of infested than uninfested females were in breeding condition, secondary reproductive success appeared to be negatively impacted by parasitism via declines in the number of litters and the total number of offspring produced by infested females. Population growth rates were negatively correlated with infestation prevalence, further indicating a negative effect of parasitism. Based on the negative impact of parasitism on reproduction, we propose that enhanced survival of infested mice can be explained by the diversion of resources from reproduction to body maintenance. Parasite-induced life history shifts in which mice decrease current reproduction to promote future reproduction, such as increasing the age at maturity, may also contribute to the decline in population growth rate observed in years of high infestation prevalence.

AB Optimal Defense Theory predicts that plants exposed to herbivory should allocate more resources to produce costly secondary metabolites in tissues with higher fitness values. To increase plant resistance, the secondary metabolites must have a negative impact on the preference and/or performance of herbivores. We tested the hypotheses that induction of secondary metabolites (phlorotannins) in a brown seaweed in response to grazing by herbivorous gastropods will differ between seaweed tissues with different fitness values (basal stipes and annual shoots), and that the subsequent change in food value will affect the fitness (growth and fecundity) of the gastropods. Induction of phlorotannins was significant in both tissue types but was more pronounced in basal stipes, which have a higher fitness value. Basal tissues also had significantly higher constitutive defense levels than did apical tissues. No effects of algal tissue type or grazing history on the growth rate of the gastropods were detected. However, the number of viable eggs was significantly lower for gastropods feeding on basal shoots, and there was a significantly lower proportion of viable eggs produced by gastropods that were offered previously grazed seaweed tissues. The results show that induced resistance, and its variation among different plant parts, call have significant negative effects on herbivore performance that may reduce future herbivore pressure and thus enhance plant fitness.

   DENITRIFICATION
AB Microbial activity in semiarid and and environments is closely related to the timing, intensity, and amount of precipitation. The characteristics of the soil surface, especially the influence of biological soil crusts, can determine the amount, location, and timing of water infiltration into desert soils, which, in turn, determines the type and size of microbial response. Nutrients resulting from this pulse then create a positive feedback as increases in microbial and plant biomass enhance future resource capture or, alternatively, may be lost to the atmosphere, deeper soils, or downslope patches. When rainfall intensity overwhelms the water infiltration capacity of the plant interspace or the plant patch, overland water flow links otherwise separated patches at many different scales via the transport of nutrients in water, soil, and organic matter. For example, material carried from the plant interspace is often deposited under an adjacent plant. Alternatively, material from both of these patches may be carried to rills that feed ephemeral channels, thence to seasonally intermittent and, finally, perennial streams. These inputs can either be retained by the stream-riparian ecosystem or be exported in surface flow. However, in larger perennial streams, the fate of these material inputs is confounded by the impact of storm-driven flows on the extant aquatic biota, as flash floods can also represent success ion-initiating disturbances to the stream-riparian ecosystem on a wide range of time scales. In contrast to uplands where precipitation initiates the microbial response, nutrient transfers can support a flush of plant uptake and microbial processing, triggered by high nutrient concentrations and changed nutrient form (e.g., nitrate or ammonium). The nature and strength of the linkages between the different ecosystem components define the structure and function of arid ecosystems. Losses of materials are natural processes, but it is problematic when conserving" systems become "leaky" via anthropogenic disturbance and losses exceed gains.

AB White-footed mice prey on gypsy moth pupae while foraging for other, more abundant food. Mice appear capable of locally extirpating moths since mice exert high predation pressure on sparse pupae and are numerically decoupled from moth populations. Nevertheless, during 23 years of monitoring, moths persisted at scales > I ha despite frequent extinctions at smaller spatial scales. We hypothesized that spatially heterogeneous intensity-in mouse foraging and/or limited moth dispersal might allow moth persistence. Using a spatially explicit, individual-based, empirically parameterized model, we show that neither spatially heterogeneous predation by mice, nor limited moth dispersal alone allows moth persistence at typical mouse densities. However, synergy between both factors allows moth population persistence at naturally Occurring Mouse densities. For example, in models with 40 mice/ha, both limited moth dispersal with spatially homogeneous predation risk and spatially heterogeneous predation risk with unlimited moth dispersal had a 0% chance of moth persistence, but the combination of limited dispersal and heterogeneous predation risk resulted in a similar to 75% chance of moth persistence. Furthermore, both for limited moth dispersal with spatially homogeneous predation risk and for spatially heterogeneous predation risk with unlimited moth dispersal, moth persistence was only guaranteed at very low mouse densities, while the combination of limited moth dispersal with heterogeneous predation guaranteed moth persistence within a broad range of mouse densities. The findings illustrate a novel mechanism of "spatial selection and satiation" that can enhance rare species persistence under intense incidental predation by generalist predators.

AB Discrete-time Markov chains are widely used to study communities of competing sessile species. Their parameters are transition probabilities between states (species found at points in space), estimated from repeated observations. The proportion of nonzero entries in the transition matrix has been suggested as a measure of the complexity of interspecific interactions. This is not accurate if more than one transition can occur per time interval. In such cases, continuous-time Markov chains may be better, and discrete-time models may overestimate the complexity of species interactions. We reanalyze data from a marine community. A continuous-time model with homogeneous rates is not significantly worse than the maximum-likelihood discrete-time model. Compared to the continuous-time model, the discrete-time model overestimates the complexity of interspecific interactions. We also discuss the entropy of a continuous-time Markov chain, another measure of complexity.

AB Several hypotheses. proposed to explain the success of introduced species focus on altered interspecific interactions. One of the most prominent, the Enemy Release Hypothesis, posits that invading species benefit compared to their native counterparts if they lose their herbivores and pathogens during the invasion process. We previously reported on a common garden experiment (from 2002) in which we compared levels of herbivory between 30 taxonomically paired native and introduced old-field plants. In this phylogenetically controlled comparison, herbivore damage tended to be higher on introduced than on native plants. This striking pattern, the opposite of current theory, prompted us to further investigate herbivory and several other interspecific interactions in a series of linked experiments with the same set of species. Here we show that, in these new experiments, introduced plants, on average, received less insect herbivory and were subject to half the negative soil microbial feedback compared to natives; attack by fungal and viral pathogens also tended to be reduced on introduced plants compared to natives. Although plant traits (foliar C:N, toughness, and water content) suggested that introduced species should be less resistant to generalist consumers, they were not consistently more heavily attacked. Finally, we used meta-analysis to combine data from this study with results from our previous work to show that escape generally was inconsistent among guilds of enemies: there were few instances in which escape from multiple guilds occurred for a taxonomic pair, and more cases in which the patterns of escape from different enemies canceled out. Our examination of multiple interspecific interactions demonstrates that escape from one guild of enemies does not necessarily imply escape from other guilds. Because the effects of each guild are likely to vary through space and time, the net effect of all enemies is also likely to be variable. The net effect of these interactions may create "invasion opportunity windows": times when introduced species make advances in native communities.

AB Plant species litter mixtures often result in nonadditive differences in ecosystem processes when compared to the average of their individual components. However, these studies are just beginning to be extended to the genotype level and to our knowledge have not incorporated the effects of herbivory or genotype-by-herbivore interactions. With a two-year field study, using genotypes that differed by as few as three restriction length polymorphism (RFLP) molecular markers, we found three major patterns when we mixed leaf litters from different genotypes both with and without previous herbivory. First, leaf litter genotype mixtures, regardless of herbivory, demonstrated nonadditive rates of decomposition and nutrient flux. Second, mixed genotype litter without herbivory decomposed faster than the same genotypes with herbivory. Third, in genotype mixtures, with and without herbivory, we found that net rates of immobilization of both nitrogen and phosphorus can differ from expected values (based on genotype means) by as much as 57%. These results show that mixing litter genotypes can alter rates of decay and nutrient flux and that the effects are reduced with herbivory. Nonadditive effects at the genotype level that we report here are nearly as large as what has been recorded for plant species mixtures and may have important, though under-appreciated, roles in ecosystems. These data further suggest that genetic diversity and genotype-by-herbivore interactions can affect fundamental ecosystem processes such as litter decomposition and nutrient flux.

AB Many birds show a surprising degree of intraspecific variability in migratory tendency and choice of wintering site. In this study, we tracked the seasonal movements of 35 nonbreeding Black-browed Albatrosses Thalassarche melanophrys from South Georgia, including 24 birds followed in two consecutive years. This revealed consistent patterns of status-related, sex-specific, and individual variation in wintering strategies, and provided the first description of the summer distribution of failed/deferring breeders. Individuals exhibited a striking degree of site fidelity, returning to the same region (southwest Africa or Australia) and showing correlated centers of distribution, as well as remarkable consistency in the chronology of their movements, in consecutive years. Nonetheless, a degree of behavioral flexibility remained, and particularly on the return migration, birds moved between, or bypassed, alternative intermediate staging sites depending on local circumstances. Initiation of the outward migration varied according to breeding status, timing of failure, and sex: deferring breeders and those that failed early departed two months before successful birds, and successful females departed 1-2 weeks earlier than males. Sex-related latitudinal variation in distribution was also apparent, with females wintering farther north within the Benguela system. Moreover, the only migrant to Australia was a male, supporting an apparent tendency for male-biased breeding dispersal inferred from genetic analyses. Distribution and timing of movements appeared in general to relate to avoidance of competition from congeners and conspecifics from other populations. From a conservation perspective, the study indicated that, for the declining Black-browed Albatross population at South Georgia, the primary focus should be toward improving the management (especially reducing bycatch levels) of fisheries in the central and eastern South Atlantic.

AB Biologically mediated modifications of the abiotic environment, also called ecosystem engineering, can significantly affect a broad range of ecosystems. Nevertheless, remarkably little work has focused on the costs and benefits that ecosystem engineers obtain from traits that underlie their. ecosystem engineering capacity. We addressed this topic by comparing two autogenic engineers, which vary in the degree in which they affect their abiotic environment via their physical structure. That is, we compared two plant species from the intertidal coastal zone (Spartina anglica and Zostera noltii), whose shoots are exposed to similar currents and waves, but differ in the extent that they modify their environment via reduction of hydrodynamic energy. Our results indicate that there can be trade-offs related to the traits that underlies autogenic ecosystem engineering capacity. Dissipation of hydrodynamic forces from waves was roughly a factor of three higher in vegetation with stiff leaves compared to those with flexible leaves. Drag was highest and most sensitive to hydrodynamic forces in stiff vegetation that does not bend with the flow. Thus, shoot stiffness determines both the capacity to reduce hydrodynamic energy (i.e., proxy for ecosystem engineering capacity) and the drag that needs to be resisted (i.e., proxy for associated costs).

AB Alpine and arctic ecosystems may be particularly vulnerable to climate change. We know little about alpine plant community responses to the predicted abiotic changes, or to possible changes in the biotic environment caused by climate change. Four years of experimental warming and nutrient addition altered dominance hierarchies, community structure, and diversity of an alpine biodiversity hotspot in south Norway. The previously dominant dwarf shrub Dryas octopetala was replaced by graminoids and forbs under nutrient addition and warming with nutrients. Community diversity declined due to decreased bryophyte and lichen richness and abundances, and dwarf shrub abundances. In controls and in plots with only warming, where Dryas maintained dominance, the relationships between changes in Dryas cover and changes in community parameters were negative, suggesting that Dryas controls community processes. Under nutrient addition, bryophyte and lichen diversity decreased with decreasing Dryas cover, probably due to increased competition from graminoids and forbs. The shift in dominance hierarchies changed community structure and dynamics through increased biomass, vegetation height, and competition for light. Community diversity dropped primarily because changes in the abiotic environment modified biotic interactions, highlighting that species interaction must be considered in climate change experiments and in models predicting climate change effects.

AB Controls over nutrient supply are key to understanding the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Conceptual models once held that in situ mineral weathering was the primary long-term control over the availability of many plant nutrients, including the base cations calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and potassium (K). Recent evidence has shown that atmospheric sources of these "rock-derived" nutrients can dominate actively cycling ecosystem pools, especially in systems on highly weathered soils. Such studies have relied heavily on the use of strontium isotopes as a proxy for base-cation cycling. Here we show that vegetation and soil-exchangeable pools of strontium in a tropical rainforest on highly weathered soils are still dominated by local rock sources. This pattern exists despite substantial atmospheric inputs of Sr, Ca. K, and M.g, and despite nearly 100% depletion of these elements from the top 1 m of soil. We present a model demonstrating that modest weathering inputs, resulting from tectonically driven erosion, could maintain parent-material dominance of actively cycling Sr. The majority of tropical forests are oil highly weathered soils but our results suggest that these forests may still show considerable variation in their primary sources of essential nutrients.

AB Trophic cascades have been documented in a diversity of ecological systems and can be important in determining biomass distribution within a community. To date, the literature on trophic cascades has focused on whether and in which systems cascades occur. Many biological (e.g., productivity : biomass ratios) and methodological (e.g., experiment size or duration) factors vary with the ecosystem in which data were collected, but ecosystem type, per se, does not provide mechanistic insights into factors controlling cascade strength. Here, we tested various hypotheses about why trophic cascades occur and what determines their magnitude using data from 114 studies that measured the indirect trophic effects of predators on plant community biomass in seven aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Using meta-analysis, we examined the relationship between the indirect effect of predator manipulation on plants and 18 biological and methodological factors quantified from these studies. We found, in contrast to predictions, that high system productivity and low species diversity do not consistently generate larger trophic cascades. A combination of herbivore and predator metabolic factors and predator taxonomy (vertebrate vs. invertebrate) explained 31% of the variation in cascade strength among all 114 studies. Within systems, 18% of the variation in cascade strength was explained with similar predator and herbivore characteristics. Within and across all systems, the strongest cascades occurred in association with invertebrate herbivores and endothermic vertebrate predators. These associations may result from a combination of true biological differences among species with different physiological requirements and bias among organisms studied in different systems. Thus, although cascade strength can be described by biological characteristics of predators and herbivores, future research on indirect trophic effects must further examine biological and methodological differences among studies and systems.

AB A. global analysis of elevational diversity trends for nonvolant small mammals revealed a clear pattern of mid-elevational peaks in species richness. Fifty-six data sets were used to test the predictions of a null model (the mid-domain effect) and climatic hypotheses. Very few data sets fit entirely within the predictions of the null model, and the average predictive power of the null model was low. Regional (gamma) diversity fit the null model better than did local (alpha) diversity. Diversity peaked at higher elevations on taller mountains, consistent with climatic factors producing elevationally correlated habitat bands (Massenerhebung effect). This positive, linear relationship was documented for all data sets but was particularly pronounced for alpha diversity. Gamma diversity, which is generally highly influenced by area, exhibited a trend of highest diversity shifting toward lower elevations, and higher elevational peaks in species diversity at higher latitudes. The elevation of temperate diversity peaks exhibited a negative association with latitude. These results are evidence for the importance of a suite of interacting climatic, area, and geometric factors on elevational diversity patterns, apparent in spite of noise associated with different sampling techniques, localities, and historical pressures.

AB Theory predicts that dietary specialization is limited in part because of physiological trade-offs associated with specialization. Specifically, dietary specialists are predicted to evolve mechanisms that reduce costs and enhance excretion of plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) that they frequently consume, but are less energetically and/or mechanistically efficient at eliminating novel PSMs. Although examples of trade-offs associated with dietary specialization have been documented among insects, trade-offs have not been investigated in mammalian herbivores. To initially investigate the physiological trade-offs associated with specialization in mammalian herbivores, we determined the impact of ingesting novel PSMs on the energy budgets of a juniper specialist (Neotoma stephensi) and generalist (N: albigula) woodrat. These results were then compared to the impact of juniper intake, the plant species preferred by the specialist, on energy budgets in these same species. Energy budgets were evaluated by measuring apparent metabolizable energy intake (AMEI, energy consumed - energy excreted) and energy expended on basal metabolic rate (BMR) and voluntary wheel running in specialist and generalist woodrats fed a formulated diet with and without PSMs from the novel plant creosote (Larrea tridentata). Both specialists and generalists were energetically impacted by the intake of a diet containing novel PSMs, primarily through decreased intake of creosote diet and increased excretion of energy in the urine. However, specialists were impacted to a greater extent than generalists. Specialists decreased body mass, whereas generalists maintained body mass. Specialists also reduced intake and AMEI when consuming creosote diet compared to control to a greater extent than generalists. In turn, specialists had one-sixth the energy available for energy dependent activities than generalists on a diet containing novel PSMs. These results are in stark contrast to the comparisons between specialists and generalists consuming PSMs from their natural diet. Specialists consumed more juniper, had higher AMEI and available energy than generalists when fed diets containing juniper foliage. These data provide the first support that physiological trade-offs associated with dietary specialization may exist in mammalian herbivores.

AB Study of the latitudinal diversity gradient to date has focused largely on pattern description, with relatively little work on the possible mechanisms underlying the pattern. One proximate mechanism is a latitudinal bias in the discrepancy between speciation and extinction rates, leading to higher rates of species diversification toward lower latitudes. Despite being central to many explanations for high tropical diversity, this mechanism is tested very rarely. We discuss some of the problems involved in testing for latitudinal bias in diversification rates and present an example phylogenetic analysis for endemic bird genera of the New World. The results provide evidence for higher diversification rates in clades inhabiting lower latitudes, both when genera are considered independent and when phylogeny is controlled for using independent contrasts. High rates of diversification are also associated with larger geographic area and higher net primary productivity, although these do not fully account for the latitudinal effect. The latitudinal pattern is stronger in younger clades, supporting the prediction of a simple model in. which the signal of latitudinal bias in diversification rates diminishes as clades age and become saturated with species. Our study demonstrates that a clade-based approach can help answer important questions that a geographic approach cannot, but large phylogenies and geographic databases are needed to cope with the large amount of noise inherent in this type of analysis.

AB Genetic variation for ecologically important traits determines the potential for evolutionary changes and should be measured directly. Such measurements of genetic variation based on quantitative genetic theory rely on assumptions of environmental constancy. These assumptions are not likely to hold in nature. Instead, natural environments are structured, and systematic variation in environmental conditions is an important determinant of phenotypic variation. Here we provide an introduction to quantitative genetics using a reaction norms approach, because we believe that this provides us with a good framework for combining ecology and genetics. We subsequently review the literature on genetic variation for clutch size of birds, and we show that, in spite of the inherent limitations of the methods employed, there is strong evidence that clutch size has a heritable component in natural populations of several species. However, the number of studies on the amount of genetic variation for clutch size in different species and across a range of environmental conditions is still far too small to study patterns in the relationship between heritable variation and properties of species and/or their environments. Furthermore, the role of both correlations and interactions with the environment in these estimates requires much more attention. Above all else, however, we need more information on the structure and magnitude of the environmental variation present in these studies. Future work should focus on how to obtain such data, and how to subsequently incorporate them into the proposed reaction norm framework. This requires the search for, and measurement of, relevant ecological variables. Also a more detailed investigation of the within-individual variation and the use of animal model methodology may prove to be valuable. Such additional data are essential for interpreting the amounts of genetic variation present for clutch size as a model system in the general problem of better understanding the maintenance of genetic variation in heterogeneous environments and the estimation of evolutionary potential.

AB The majority of food-web studies currently used to test ecological theory have integrated information over large spatial and temporal scales. We aimed to assess the degree to which food webs display patch-scale variation, and the consequences for emergent properties at the larger scale of the stream reach. Spatial heterogeneity in ecological conditions (habitat structure and food resources) and food-web structure were measured in three streams. All food webs were constructed using equivalent effort at a patch scale (0.06 m(2)) and a reach scale (30-m stream length). A mosaic of habitat structure and food resources was reflected in considerable variability in food-web structure among patches, but there was less variation within than among streams. The variability in food-web attributes among patches could not always be related to ecological conditions, but food resource availability affected connectedness of food webs and trophic structure (measured as functional feeding groups). Of particular note was the result that reach-summary food webs were consistently different from patch-specific food webs in each stream. Reach-scale food webs underestimated connectance but overestimated prey: predator ratios and the number of trophic links. Summary webs sometimes placed species together that, in fact, did not coexist in the field. Such within-site food-web heterogeneity needs to be taken into account in future multiple-site comparisons of food-web structure.

AB Body size has long been hypothesized to play a major role in community structure and dynamics. Two general hypotheses exist for how resources are distributed among body sizes: (1) resources are equally available and uniformly utilized across body sizes and (2) resources are differentially available to organisms of different body sizes, resulting in a nonuniform or modal distribution. It has also been predicted that the distribution of body sizes of species in a community should reflect the underlying availability of resources, with the emergence of aggregations of species around specific body sizes. I examined the relationship between energy utilization, body size, and community structure in nine small-mammal communities in North America. In all communities, energy use across body sizes was significantly different from uniform. In contrast, none of the nine species-level body size distributions were significantly different from uniform. Cross-site comparisons showed that, while the species-level body size distribution did not vary significantly among sites, the utilization of energy across body sizes did. These results suggest that uniform energy utilization does not occur in small-mammal communities and that the species-level body size distribution of a community is not determined by resource utilization.

AB Although the rate that species accumulate with area has long been regarded as an important component of fine-scale community structure and several studies have examined this rate in meta-analyses, few if any studies have systematically examined fine-scale species-area relationships using a consistent survey protocol over a large region. We examined fine-scale species-area relationships using the extensive database of the Carolina Vegetation Survey (North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee, USA), including 1472 plots wherein vascular plant richness was recorded for each of six subplot sizes regularly spaced on a log(10) scale, from 0.01 to 1000 m(2). Contrary to prevailing theory, our data closely and consistently fit an Arrhenius (power law) species-area model, echoing broader-scale patterns. Species accumulation rate (Z) values fell within a narrow range (95% between 0.2 and 0.5) despite a 30-fold range in 1000-m(2) richness. When we added regional- and global-scale richness estimates to our results, a Preston-type triphasic curve emerged. We suggest that (1) fine-scale species-area relationships are remarkably consistent and (2) full-scale species-area curves reveal scale dependencies in diversity data that are not accounted for by current species-area theory.

AB We examine the role of rare species in the problem of estimating within-habitat species richness based on sampling data. Richness estimation can be modeled realistically for abundance-based and incidence-based data using Poisson or binomial mixtures, respectively. The problem can be reduced to estimation of the odds of the probability of a species remaining undetected in the sample or sample set. Within this rigorous statistical framework, we explore existing methods of richness estimation and assess their limitations. We do this by modeling the addition of increasing numbers of rare, undetected species to a reference assemblage, assessing the power of different methods to distinguish the modified species assemblages from the reference assemblage. (We use empirical example data sets for birds, seeds, and beetles as reference assemblages.) By considering the contributions of rare species and the role of undetected species for a fixed sampling effort, we show why the problem of richness estimation is so difficult, and we discuss what statistical models can provide.

AB Metapopulation models assume that local population size (in a habitat patch) and therefore local extinction probability, is a function of patch size, and that interpatch movement rate and therefore recolonization of local extinctions is a function of both patch size and patch isolation. We hypothesized that the predictive power of models that relate patch immigation rate to patch size and isolation will be reduced when spatial structure in the landscape matrix (the nonhabitat portion of the landscape) affects organism movernent through the landscape. We used a simulation model to evaluate this hypothesis for three different aspects of matrix spatial structure (contrast among matrix cover types, number of matrix cover types, and grain of matrix spatial pattern) and for two different types of movement behavior, representing a specialist and a generalist species. We tested the hypothesis for one aspect of matrix structure (number of matrix cover types) in a translocation field Study of the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus, a habitat specialist) and the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus, a habitat generalist). When the matrix was composed of a small number of cover types, patch size and isolation accounted for Lip to 75% of the variation in patch immigration rate in the simulation study, and for 61 % of the variation in interpatch movement in the field study. However, when the matrix was composed of a large number of cover types, the amount of explained variation dropped to as little as 33% for the simulation study and to 17% in the field study. Our results suggest that patch characteristics, such as patch size and isolation, may be poor predictors of interpatch movement when the landscape matrix is heterogeneous and when the organism responds to boundaries between different matrix cover types. These results imply that habitat patch-based models, such as those based on current metapopulation theory, will perform poorly in these situations.

AB Biological diversity is complex and can be described and quantified in various ways. Research exploring the consequences of biodiversity for ecosystem functioning has generally focused on the effects of four components of biodiversity: species richness and composition, and functional group richness and composition. Most of the research to date has focused on biodiversity effects within single trophic levels. The aim of this study was to compare the relative effects of these four components of biological diversity across pond food webs using aquatic mesocosm experiments in which all four community properties were manipulated independently. Functional groups were defined in terms of trophic groups, and consisted of aquatic macrophytes, periphyton grazers, and invertebrate predators. Species composition and species richness were manipulated within functional groups. Ecosystem response variables included the final biomass of the manipulated taxa (macrophytes, grazers, and predators), ecosystem rates (productivity and decomposition), and trophic structure (phytoplankton and periphyton biomass). Results reveal strong effects of species composition on a significant proportion of ecosystem response variables. In contrast, species richness, functional group richness, and functional group composition altered the biomass of the manipulated taxa, but had no additional effects on other ecosystem variables. Results suggest that the roles of species in ecosystems, when considered in a food web context, are often the result of both direct and indirect effects that are difficult to predict based on the association of a species to a particular functional group. If a goal of biodiversity research is to predict the response of ecosystems to biodiversity loss, effects of composition and species losses across food webs must be fully integrated into biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research.

AB Many ecological time series describe population dynamics. Indirectly, these data also provide information about the vital rates (e.g., birth rates, mortality rates) underlying these dynamics, but extracting this information from the data can be difficult. Here, we present a method for estimating fluctuating vital rates from ecological time series by using a model to re-code information in observed dynamics into information about unobserved vital rates. This model construction differs from most current models by replacing strong assumptions about the functional relationships dictating population dynamics with more conservative assumptions about how vital rates change with time. Thus, this method is a tool for analyzing time-series data that avoids strong assumptions about the mechanisms driving population dynamics.
   Our work is motivated by studying the biological control of pea aphids in alfalfa in south-central Wisconsin. Pea aphid populations are consistently held below economic threshold, although the source of this regulation is unclear. Here, we analyze monitoring data to understand the role that a specialist parasitoid plays in aphid biocontrol. Our modeling methodology allows us to estimate the vital rates that determine aphid dynamics (in particular, parasitism) without making arbitrary assumptions about the relationship between parasitism and aphid or parasitoid density. We find that, while parasitism depresses aphid population growth rate substantially, declines in aphid Population growth rates do not coincide with increases in parasitism. Therefore, parasitism cannot be responsible for the density-dependent regulation of aphid populations observed in the field.

AB The 1988 Yellowstone fires resulted in a complex mosaic within which post-fire lodgepole pine seedling densities varied by over five orders of magnitude. Investigators have speculated that such postfire mosaics of vegetation structure may persist until the next large disturbance, but the fate of the initial structural variability of postfire communities is currently poorly understood. We studied lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Englem. ex Wats.) stands in Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming, USA) unburned by the 1988 fires to determine how variation in stand structure changes with increasing stand age. The coefficient Of variation in stand density decreased from 231% in 12-yr-old stands to 91% in stands aged 50-100 yr, and to 37% for stands ages 200-250 yr. Substantial variability in age distributions both within and among age classes suggested that both gradual infilling of initially sparse stands and self-thinning of initially dense stands are important processes affecting variation in. stand density. Variation in stand density was explained primarily by stand age (P < 0.0001) and by geographic location (P < 0.01). Field estimates and reconstructions of stand density trajectories suggest the importance of biotic processes and the contingent effects that produce initial patterns of stand density. Variation in stand density is substantially reduced 125 yr following fire and remains relatively unchanged beyond approximately 200 yr. These results suggest that large, infrequent fires impose a pattern of stand structural variability that may persist for centuries, but stand density likely converges within the fire-free interval in this landscape.

AB A central theory in mammalian herbivore-plant interactions is that feeding decisions depend on an animal's capacity to detoxify plant secondary metabolites (PSMs). Thus, if a herbivore. could detoxify a PSM faster, it might eat more. This theory has been difficult to test because the mechanisms by which herbivores detoxify most PSMs are largely unknown. We investigated whether common brushtail possums alter aspects of their feeding in response to an increased capacity to detoxify benzoic acid, a common PSM. Animals detoxify benzoic acid primarily by conjugating it with glycine to form benzoyl glycine (hippuric acid). Therefore, adding glycine to a diet that contains benzoic acid provides a simple way to study how detoxification constrains feeding in mammals. Brushtail possums offered supplementary glycine metabolized benzoate faster and, in response, ate more. Furthermore, when given a choice, brushtail possums selected a diet containing both ben zoate and glycine over diets with a high concentration of just one of these supplements. The possums' aversion to glycine may explain why their ability to. select a favorable diet combination from feeders containing diets with each of the supplements seemed less acute: they preferred diets containing benzoate alone over those containing glycine and did not mix their diet even though it would have allowed them to eat more benzoate and thus more food. Administering the anti-emetic drug, ondansetron (a specific 5-HT3 receptor antagonist), did not alter the amount eaten of diets containing benzoate, glycine, or both, suggesting that 5-HT3 receptors do not regulate benzoate or glycine intake. The results show that common brushtail possums recognize changes in their detoxification capacity and alter their feeding response accordingly.

AB The realms of rare species conservation and metapopulation biology theory are often interrelated, and hence share several basic challenges. Two of the most important are the critical and frequently difficult tasks of distinguishing a priori between habitat and nonhabitat, and then delimiting suitable habitat patches in a study area. We combined classification tree analysis, a subset of classification and regression tree (CART) modeling, with digital data layers of environmental variables in a geographic information system (GIS) to predict suitable habitat and potential new population occurrences for turkeybeard (Xerophyllum asphodeloides), a rare liliaceous understory herb associated with southern Appalachian pine-oak (Pinus-Quercus) forests, in northwestern Virginia. Sample values from eight environmental data layers and population survey data were used in the modeling process to produce a cross-validated classification tree that predicted suitable habitat in the study area. Elevation, slope, forest type, and fire frequency were the four main explanatory variables in the model. Approximately 4% of the study area was classified into five suitable habitat classes, with a misclassification error rate of 4.74%. The final 13-leaf tree correctly classified 74% of the known presence areas and 90% of the known absence areas, and ground-truthing surveys resulted in the discovery of eight new occupied habitat patches. Results of this study are important for conservation and management of X. asphodeloides, as well as for the applicability of the habitat modeling techniques to enhancing the study of metapopulations and disturbance regimes in Appalachian forests. In addition, they confirm the potential and value of CART and GIS-based modeling approaches to species distribution problems. Our model was successful at defining suitable habitat and discovering new populations of a rare species at the landscape scale. Similar application to other rare species could prove very useful for addressing these and other ecological and conservation issues, such as planning transplantation or reintroduction experiments, identifying metapopulation fragmentation thresholds, and formulating conservation strategies.

AB Invasion biologists typically regard susceptibility of an invasive species to native predators as a fortuitous condition that increases biotic resistance to the invasion. The line of reasoning is that predation weakens the net impact of the invader and reduces its ability to displace native competitors. However, predation on invasives is a coupled interaction; every invader consumed also enhances the predator population. If these predators also consume native species, then the invader's indirect effect via predators (i.e., apparent competition) could be more harmful to natives than the effect of resource competition from the exotic. We apply general community ecology theory to determine the conditions under which the net effect of predation on the exotic species is to extirpate the native competitor. An approximation to these conditions provides a simple metric to estimate the threat of native species extinction due to-apparent competition posed by an invader.

AB Studies of aquatic food webs rarely address the role of migratory waterfowl, even though they are ubiquitous and many are omnivorous. Several species of waterfowl consume belowground plant tubers during winter, yet the impact of such herbivory on future plant abundance is mostly unknown. To test the impact of wintering waterfowl on submerged vegetation, we installed waterfowl exclosures (N = 5) and reference plots (N = 5) open to grazing in Lake Mattamuskeet, North Carolina, USA, where Vallisneria americana (water celery, or tapegrass) dominated the plant community. Over the three-year study period, we sampled above- and belowground plant standing stock every 2-3 mo. Reference plots had a lower density (number per square meter) of Vallisneria tubers than ungrazed exclosures (repeated-measures ANOVA treatment P = 0.038, time X treatment P = 0.025). Percentage loss of tubers in reference plots was positively related to the density of tubers at the onset of winter (R-2 = 0.294, P = 0.026). Despite significant reduction of tubers during winter, no detectable carryover effects of waterfowl exclosure on Vallisneria aboveground biomass occurred in subsequent growing seasons (rmANOVA treatment P = 0.342, time X treatment P = 0.539). Our study detected a threshold tuber density below which waterfowl herbivory on Vallisneria did not occur. Therefore, our results suggest that limits on waterfowl foraging efficiency provide a refuge for aquatic plants subject to intense, seasonal predation.

AB The relative importance of plasticity vs.. adaptation for the spread of invasive species has rarely been studied. We examined this question in a clonal population of invasive freshwater snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) from the western United States by testing whether observed plasticity in life history traits conferred higher fitness across a range of temperatures. We raised isofemale lines from three populations from different climate regimes (high- and low-elevation rivers and an estuary) in a split-brood, common-garden design in three temperatures. We measured life history and growth traits and calculated population growth rate (as a measure of fitness) using an age-structured projection matrix model. We found a strong effect of temperature on all traits, but no evidence for divergence in the average level of traits among populations. Levels of genetic variation and significant reaction norm divergence for life history traits suggested some role for adaptation. Plasticity varied among traits and was lowest for size and reproductive traits compared to age-related traits and fitness. Plasticity in fitness was intermediate, suggesting that invasive populations are not general-purpose genotypes with respect to the range of temperatures studied. Thus, by considering plasticity in fitness and its component traits, we have shown that trait plasticity alone does not yield the same fitness across a relevant set of temperature conditions.

ID SUCCESS
AB Mayfield estimates of daily survival are the most commonly available nest survival estimates in the ecological and ornithological literature. However, application of the Mayfield technique requires assumptions about the distributions of hatching and fledging events that are violated in most empirical data sets. We unified several variants of the Mayfield model using a discrete Markov chain formulation and used this formulation to study the effects of assumptions about transition probabilities under varying distributions of discovery probability. In general, bias in estimated survival was greatest when nests were most likely to be discovered late in the nesting cycle. Assuming that hatching and fledging events occur at the midpoint of an observation, or with uniform probability during an observation, also resulted in large biases. Estimates of standard error of daily survival and overall success were much more accurate and consistent. Knowing the nest age can greatly reduce bias but increases the invasiveness of monitoring and requires incorporation of transition probabilities in the Mayfield likelihood function. Based on our simulation results, we suggest that traditional Mayfield models are likely to provide adequate estimates for most applications if nests are monitored at intervals of no longer than three days.

AB Multi-scale ordination (MSO) deals with potential scale dependence in species assemblages by studying how results from multivariate ordination may be different at different spatial scales. MSO methods were initially based on two-term local covariances between species and, therefore, required sampling designs composed of adjacent quadrats. A variogram-based MSO, recently introduced by H. H. Wagner, is applicable to very diverse sampling designs and for use with principal-components analysis, correspondence analysis, and derived, "two-table" (also called "direct") ordination methods, i.e., redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis.
   In this paper we put forward an enlarged framework for variogram-based MSO that relies on a generalized definition of inter-species covariance and on matrix expression of spatial contiguity between sampling units. This enables us to provide distance-explicit decompositions of variances and covariances (in their generalized meaning) that are consistent with many ordination methods in both their single- and two-table versions. A spatially explicit apportioning of diversity indices is proposed for some particular definitions of variance. Referring to two-table ordination methods allowed the multi-scale study of residual spatial patterns after factoring out available environmental variables. Some aspects of the approach are briefly illustrated with vegetation data from a Neotropical rain forest in French Guiana.

AB Long-lived species are expected to reduce their current reproductive effort in adverse conditions in order not to jeopardize their future reproduction. Parasitic Jaegers (Stercoraritis parcisiticits) breeding in Shetland, United Kingdom, have declined substantially in numbers over the last 15 years, although the causes of this decline remain unclear. By carrying out a supplementary feeding experiment during the chick-rearing period, we tested the hypothesis that food availability has contributed to this decline. Data were collected on adult territory attendance, chick growth rates, and breeding success during the experimental season, and adult return rates, body condition, and laying dates during the following season. Differences in carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in the natural and supplementary food, analyzed in the chicks ' feathers, showed that chicks received one-fifth of their protein requirements front the supplementary food, but this amount varied between broods. Compared with controls, supplemented pairs showed higher attendance on the territory. improved breeding success, and higher return rate. This emphasizes that adult return rate is more sensitive to food availability than has been assumed previously. Control birds may have maintained too high a current reproductive effort at the expense Of future reproduction, perhaps due to the unpredictability of their main food source, sandeels, which seemed abundant early in the season but scarce during chick rearing. This study Suggests that the consequences of poor food availability are shared between offspring and parents in this species.

AB Temperature profoundly affects growth and life history traits in ectothermic animals through selection (i.e., genetic) and through direct effects on the phenotype (i.e., nongenetic/plasticity). We examined the effects of rearing temperature (24 degrees, 30 degrees, and 36 degrees C) on adult body size and development time and the interactive effects of temperature experienced during rearing and oviposition on several life history traits (age-at-first-reproduction, fecundity, egg size, egg development, and egg hatching) in two populations of the seed beetle, Stator limbatus, collected at different elevations. The higher elevation population was larger and matured sooner than the low-elevation population when raised at the lower temperature, but the reverse was true at the higher temperature suggesting that these populations have adapted to local temperature. There were interactions between the effects of rearing temperature and oviposition temperature for age-at-first-reproduction, fecundity, egg development, egg hatching, and two composite measures of fitness, generating complex reaction norms. The most dramatic example of this was a large maternal effect on egg hatching; females raised at low temperature produced eggs that had substantially reduced hatching when laid at hi h temperature. Our experimental design also allowed us to explore 0 9 the adaptive significance of acclimation. Beetles reared at intermediate or low temperature had the highest fitness at Multiple oviposition temperatures. There was little support for the "beneficial acclimation hypothesis," which predicts that beetles should have higher fitness at the temperature at which they were reared; acclimation had only a small effect on fitness. This study shows that temperature-mediated plasticity can be complex, but these complex patterns can yield new insights into the evolution of phenotypic plasticity.

AB Variables determining the number of native and alien plants on arable land in Central Europe are identified. Species richness of 698 samples of weed floras recorded in the Czech Republic in plots of a standard size of 100 m(2) in 1955-2000 was studied in relation to altitudinally based floristic region, soil type, type of cultivated crop, climatic variables, altitude, year of the record, crop cover and height, and human population density in the region. Vascular plant species were classified into native and alien, the latter divided in archaeophytes, introduced before AD 1500, and neophytes, introduced after this date. The use of minimal adequate models in the analysis of covariance allowed determination of the net effects of mutually correlated environmental variables. Models for particular species groups explained 33-48% of variation in species numbers and 27-51% in proportions; however, explanatory variables affected native species, archaeophytes, and neophytes differently. The number and proportion of neophytes increased in 1955-2000, whereas the number of native species and archaeophytes declined (in archaeophytes more slowly in the warm than in the moderate to cool altitudinal floristic region). In warm and dry regions and on dry soils, where most archaeophytes find optimum conditions, fewer native species are able to persist in weed communities than in colder and wetter regions. Archaeophytes respond like neophytes to some variables (climate, seasonal development of crop) and alternatively like native species to other variables (increasing agricultural intensification through time, human population density). Archaeophytes are common in old crops introduced with the beginning of agriculture (cereals), but are poorly represented in relatively recently introduced crops (rape, maize), where neophytes are most numerous. These patterns reflect the history of plant invasions in Central Europe. Neolithic agriculture, introduced from the Near East in the sixth millenium BC, brought archaeophytes with crops and, by creating intense and continuous propagule pressure and imposing new agricultural management, facilitated their invasion. By contrast, the crops introduced during the past five centuries and their specific agrotechnical management have supported spreading of other weed species, mainly invaders from overseas.

AB The risk of extinction of populations has not previously been empirically related to parameters characterizing their population dynamics. To analyze this relationship, we simulated how the distribution of population dynamical characters changed as a function of time, in both the remaining and the extinct populations. We found for a set of 38 bird populations that environmental stochasticity had the most immediate effect on the risk of extinction, whereas the long-term persistence of the population was most strongly affected by the specific population growth rate. This illustrates the importance of including information on temporal trends in population size when assessing the viability of a population. We used these relationships to examine whether time to extinction can be predicted from interspecific life history variation. Two alternative hypotheses were examined. (1) Time to extinction should decrease with increasing clutch size or decreasing survival rate because of the larger stochastic components in the population dynamics of such species. (2) Time to extinction should increase with decreasing clutch size or longer life expectancy if extinction rates are most strongly influenced by variation in the specific population growth rate. In the present data set, time to extinction increased with decreasing clutch size because of larger stochastic influences on the population dynamics of species with large clutch sizes located toward the fast end of the "slow-fast continuum" of life history variation. This demonstrates that interspecific variation in extinction risk can be predicted from knowledge of general life history characteristics. Such information can therefore be useful for assessing minimum sizes of viable populations of birds.

AB Attributes of a species' spatial distribution, such as the number of occurrences and the spatial distribution of those occurrences, can affect extinction risk. Extinction risk, however, is scale dependent, and it is unclear how scale dependency affects linkages between species' distributions and extinction risk. Here, we evaluate the relationships between number of occurrences, distributional fragmentation, and extinction risk for a diverse assemblage of desert fishes across multiple spatial scales. We used the SONFISHES biodiversity database, which details occurrence patterns of 25 native fishes to contrast the species' historical distributions with their much-reduced modern distributions. Defining occurrences (and losses to extinction) at each of five scales (5, 25, 100, 500, and 2500 km of stream reach), we found that range fragmentation was a stronger predictor of extinction risk than the number of occurrences for all scales of analysis. Furthermore, we detected scale dependence in the strength of the predictive relationship between fragmentation and extinction, with loss of occurrences at intermediate scales (similar to100 km of stream reach) being most closely tied to range fragmentation. Importantly, our results proved insensitive to our definition of the historical and modern periods. These findings highlight the value of multiscale analyses to investigations of extinction in species assemblages.

AB Both density-mediated and trait-mediated indirect biotic interactions may be important in structuring communities. Indirect interactions in many study systems remain unexplored; in part, because they are often difficult to detect, and in many instances, have been identified empirically only when unexpected results arise. Indirect effects induced by competition may be particularly important among organisms with complex life cycles, wherein competitive effects experienced in one life stage influence species interactions in one or more subsequent stages. We determined whether species-specific effects of larval competition in the mosquitoes Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti have indirect effects at the adult stage, specifically testing for effects on arboviral infection with Sindbis virus (SINV). For A. albopictus, but not for A. aegypti, competition resulted in greater infection, body titer, and dissemination rates compared to low-competition conditions. Whole body titers of virus increased with adult size irrespective of competition. However, between competitive treatments, mosquitoes from low-competition conditions had greater mean size, with lower infection rates and lower whole body titers than the smaller mosquitoes from high-competition conditions. These results suggest that larval competition, common in natural mosquito populations, has important indirect effects on adults by altering mosquito-virus interactions.

AB Ecologists increasingly recognize that plant-plant facilitation can influence plant community structure. However, seed dispersal facilitation among plant neighbors that share seed dispersal agents has received little study. Seed dispersal facilitation among neighboring plants can be defined as an increase in the number, distances, and/or places reached by a plant's seeds that is due to the presence of co-fruiting-plant neighbors with which it shares frugivore seed dispersers. I experimentally tested the potential for seed dispersal facilitation and competition among co-fruiting-plant neighbors using Solanum americanum and Cestrum diurnum, two plant species that co-occur in open habitats of Puerto Rico and whose seeds are dispersed by the same bird species. I constructed S. americanum neighborhoods with and without C. diurnum (i.e., mixed and non-mixed) while controlling plant ripe-fruit crop and surrounding fruiting landscape in six replicate fields. I quantified seed dispersal using a grid of seed-collecting trays bearing bird perches placed at four distance classes from experimental plant neighborhoods. I found no difference in the quantity or rate of fruit removal between mixed and non-mixed neighborhoods. However, there were significantly more bird droppings with seeds collected from mixed neighborhoods than from monospecific S. americanum neighborhoods. Although the quantity of seed dispersal was no different among treatments, S. americanum seeds were distributed into more "packaging units" and reached more sampling trays when neighbored by C. diurnum. This was explained by the higher number of frugivores that visited mixed neighborhoods compared to Solarium-only neighborhoods, and by an associated increase in agonistic interactions in mixed neighborhoods. Therefore, the seed dispersal pattern of S. americanum was facilitated by the presence of fruiting C. diurnum neighbors. This study provides the first experimental evidence that seed dispersal kernels of endozoochorous plants are context dependent and not entirely a property of individual plant or disperser species.

AB The species-area relationship (SAR) plays a central role in biodiversity research, and recent work has increased awareness of its temporal analogue, the species-time relationship (STR). Here we provide evidence for a general species-time-area relationship (STAR), in which species number is a function of the area and time span of sampling, as well as their interaction. For eight assemblages, ranging from lake zooplankton to desert rodents, this model outperformed a sampling-based model and two simpler models in which area and time had independent effects. In every case, the interaction, on term was negative, meaning that rates of species accumulation in space decreased with the time span of sampling, while species accumulation rates in time decreased with area sampled. Although questions remain about its precise functional form, the STAR provides a tool for scaling species richness across time and space, for comparing the relative rates of species turnover in space and time at different scales of sampling, and for rigorous testing of mechanisms proposed to drive community dynamics. Our results show that the SAR and STR are not separate relationships but two dimensions of one unified pattern.

AB Explaining patterns of latitudinal and seasonal trends in clutch size are two of the oldest and most fundamental endeavors in avian life history research. Underlying the majority of studies regarding any type of clutch size variation (i.e., individual, seasonal, latitudinal) of altricial birds is the premise that the primary cost of reproduction stems from feeding offspring. However, both altricial and precocial species of birds display latitudinal and seasonal variation in clutch size. Additionally, individual variation in costs of laying and incubation, recently demonstrated, indicates that understanding latitudinal and seasonal clutch size trends will require increased attention to earlier phases of reproduction.
   Given the strength and ubiquity of the clutch size patterns, many environmental factors, such as food supply and predation, have been proposed to account for the patterns, but temperature has been largely overlooked. Gradients in many variables may be important because the primacy of selection pressures may also vary in space and time. Furthermore, physiological systems may constrain responses to selection pressures. Thus, it is possible that intraspecific geographic and seasonal patterns in clutch size are at least partially influenced by temperature-dependent physiological processes. Therefore, we suggest that it is important to examine physiological responses of birds (e.g., embryo development, incubation energetics) directly influenced by physical properties of the environment, which exhibit predictable types of spatial and temporal variation (e.g., temperature, humidity, day length). We review two recently proposed, complementary hypotheses that are excellent candidates for this approach. By one mechanism, the thermal inertia of large clutches makes them favorable in cooler weather (the clutch-cooling hypothesis of J.M. Reid et al.). By the other, the reduction in egg viability under warm temperatures favors small clutches (the egg-viability hypothesis of S. H. Stoleson and S. R. Beissinger). Using general linear mixed models, we found that large-scale nesting patterns of Eastern Bluebirds and Red-winged Blackbirds are consistent with the egg-viability hypothesis in that females appear to initiate incubation before clutch completion when they lay large clutches at low latitudes. Although attempts have been made to overcome the logistical obstacles associated with studying large-scale phenomena through meta-analyses and multiple small-scale study sites, we demonstrate the significant potential of new technologies combined with volunteer-based studies to validate these hypotheses as we outline directions for future research.

AB Land use and altered carbon dynamics are two of the primary components of global change, and the effect of land use on carbon cycling is a crucial issue in regional scale biogeochemistry. Previous studies have shown that climate and soil conditions control net primary production (NPP) at regional scales, and that agricultural land use can influence NPP at local scales through altered water availability and carbon allocation-patterns. However, few studies have attempted to quantify the effect of cultivation on NPP at regional scales, and no studies have examined this relationship for the most heavily cultivated region of the United States, the Great Plains. We quantified current regional aboveground and belowground productivity (including cultivation) for nine years on a county basis from (1) USDA agricultural census data, and (2) STATSGO range site production values. By comparing these data with values of native vegetation NPP (precultivation) derived from STATSGO, we estimated that cultivation is increasing regional NPP by similar to 10%, or 0.046 Pg C/yr. In addition, we examined the relationship between cultivation of particular crops and NPP change and characterized the influence of individual crops on primary productivity.

AB We monitored mortality and recruitment annually for six years for all trees >= 5 cm diameter at breast height in four 1-ha plots in second-growth, lowland rain forests in northeastern Costa Rica. Stands initially ranged in age from 12 to 25 years since abandonment of cattle pastures. In younger stands, abundance decreased 10-20% in the small size class (5-9.9 cm dbh), but increased 49-100% in the large size class (>= 25 cm dbh). In the two youngest plots, 45.0% and 27.6% of the common tree species showed annual population increases of 3% or more, whereas 10% showed annual decreases of 4% or more. Annual rates of tree mortality for all size classes and recruitment into the 5-cm size class varied significantly among years, and mortality rates of trees 5-9.9 cm dbh were higher in younger than in older stands. Tree mortality was highest during the 1997-1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) year; on average, 5.6%, 3.5%, and 1.4% of trees died in the small, intermediate, and large size classes, respectively. Mortality rates during the ENSO year were 1.9 times higher for trees >= 10 cm dbh compared to non-ENSO years. Annual mortality rates for trees >= 10 cm dbh decreased significantly with increasing dry-season rainfall, but not with total annual rainfall during the census periods. Tree mortality (particularly for trees >= 25 cm dbh) in these secondary forests was highly sensitive to dry-season rainfall, even during non-ENSO years. Increased tree mortality during ENSO years is likely to accelerate forest dynamics and successional change in wet tropical second-growth forests.

AB A trophic cascade recently has been reported among wolves, elk, and aspen on the northern winter range of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA, but the mechanisms of indirect interactions within this food chain have yet to be established. We investigated whether the observed trophic cascade might have a behavioral basis by exploring environmental factors influencing the movements of 13 female elk equipped with GPS radio collars. We developed a simple statistical approach that can unveil the concurrent influence of several environmental features on animal movements. Paths of elk traveling on their winter range were broken down into steps, which correspond to the straight-line segment between successive locations at 5-hour intervals. Each observed step was paired with 200 random steps having the same starting point, but differing in length and/or direction. Comparisons between the characteristics of observed and random steps using conditional logistic regression were used to model environmental features influencing movement patterns. We found that elk movements were influenced by multiple factors, such as the distance from roads, the presence of a steep slope along the step, and the cover type in which they ended. The influence of cover type on elk movements depended on the spatial distribution of wolves across the northern winter range of the park. In low wolf-use areas, the relative preference for end point locations of steps followed: aspen stands > open areas > conifer forests. As the risks of wolf encounter increased, the preference of elk for aspen stands gradually decreased, and selection became strongest for steps ending in conifer forests in high wolf-use areas. Our study clarifies the behavioral mechanisms involved in the trophic cascade of Yellowstone's wolf-elk-aspen system: elk respond to wolves on their winter range by a shift in habitat selection, which leads to local reductions in the use of aspen by elk.

AB Biological rhythms with lunar components are common in nature. In the sea, the moon's gravitational pull on earth is the principal cause of the tides, which normally reach maximum amplitudes every new and full moon. Many populations synchronize spawning to this time. Some choose either the new or the full moon, implying that moonlight is important; but one lunar phase usually has higher tides than the other, and many species select the phase with the higher tide to improve the offshore transport of their progeny. However, tidal dominance by one lunar phase is not constant; it switches between new and full moon every seven months. We tested the influence of this 14-month "syzygy inequality cycle" (SIC) on lunar synchrony by sampling 11 populations of intertidal crabs at two locations in East Africa for 21 months. Eight populations synchronized larval release with the SIC. Tidal cues were more important than moonlight in entraining the reproductive rhythm, although two populations synchronized spawning to the new moon. SIC synchrony increased with population shore level, because only the higher lunar tide permitted top-shore spawning. Top-shore species therefore have a restricted lunar choice. SIC synchrony could be common, given that it occurs in most marine environments.

Nematode worms, the most important element of the simplest faunal communities previously reported worldwide (from the Ross Sea Dry Valley region of continental Antarctica), and micro arthropods, otherwise represented in all known Antarctic terrestrial communities, are absent. The tardigrade community composition shows affinity with the continental Antarctic fauna, with which it shares three species.

AB Willows are important riparian colonizers. However, the predominant models of early riparian colonization, which emphasize seedling recruitment, are inadequate to explain the success of these species in light of the extremely low rates of seedling survival observed. We used molecular fingerprinting markers (AFLPs) to identify and characterize Salix exigua clones on six sites, ranging in size from 850 to 1150 m(2), located on two rivers. Clones as large as 325 m(2) were detected, and an average of six clones per site occupied 75% of the vegetated area. Building on Mahoney and Rood's recruitment box model, we propose a model whereby prolific clonal growth allows for long-term colonization of riparian zones, and the balance between the relative importance of seedling regeneration and clonal growth varies based upon disturbance regime. A reduction in disturbance regime resulted in greater clonal growth and reduced genotypic variation. It is probable that, with an extended reduction in disturbance, the Salix exigua component would be represented by fewer, larger clones and would eventually decline significantly when these clones are replaced by taller and more shade tolerant species.

AB Amino acids are emerging as a critical component of the terrestrial N cycle, yet there is little understanding of amino acid cycling in temperate forests: This research studied the uptake and turnover of amino acid N by soil microbes and the capacity of forest trees to take up the amino acid glycine in comparison to NH4+ and NO3-. This research was conducted in three temperate forests located in northwest Connecticut, USA. The three forests differed in soil parent material and canopy tree species composition. At all three sites, amino acids were released from soil organic matter through the activity of proteolytic enzymes resulting in a pool of free amino acids in soil. Free amino acids were rapidly immobilized by soil microbes. A N-15-enriched-glycine-addition experiment also showed that a significant fraction of the amino acid N taken up by soil microbes was mineralized to NH4+ with substantial nitrification at one site. Tree species from all three sites had the physiological capacity to absorb the amino acid glycine but took up amino acid N, NH4+, and NO3- in proportion to their availability in the soil. At the site with the highest gross fluxes of N, nearly all the N in amino acids was mineralized, and fine roots assimilated inorganic N much more rapidly than amino acid N. At the two sites with slower rates of gross amino acid production, the pool of free amino acids was larger, and fine roots assimilated amino acid N almost as fast as inorganic N. This study demonstrates that amino acids are an important component of the N cycle in temperate forests.

AB Invasion of the exotic annual grass Bromus tectorum into stands of the native perennial grass Hilaria jamesii significantly reduced the abundance of soil biota, especially microarthropods and nematodes. Effects of invasion on active and total bacterial and fungal biomass were variable, although populations generally increased after 50+ years of invasion. The invasion of Bromus also resulted in a decrease in richness and a species shift in plants, microarthropods, fungi, and nematodes. However, despite the depauperate soil fauna at the invaded sites, no effects were seen on cellulose decomposition rates, nitrogen mineralization rates, or vascular plant growth. When Hilaria was planted into soils from riot-invaded, recently invaded, and historically invaded sites (all currently or once dominated by Hilaria), germination and survivorship were not affected. In contrast, aboveground Hilaria biomass was significantly. greater in recently invaded soils than in the other two soils. We attributed the Hilaria response to differences in soil nutrients present before the invasion, especially soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, as these nutrients were elevated in the soils that produced the greatest Hilaria biomass. Our data suggest that it is not soil biotic richness per se that determines soil process rates or plant productivity, but instead that either (1) the presence of a few critical soil food web taxa can keep ecosystem function high, (2) nutrient loss is very slow in this ecosystem, and/or (3) these processes are microbially driven. However, the presence of Bromus may reduce key soil nutrients over time and thus may eventually suppress native plant success.

AB Anthropogenic habitat alteration has long been neglected as a factor in the analysis of predictability patterns in biological communities. We tested this factor by investigating anuran leaf litter assemblages in primary and secondary forests of Tai National Park, Ivory Coast, during two years.
   We measured predictability of assemblage composition by analyzing correlations between the off-diagonal elements of distance matrices based on (1) species distribution, (2) environmental characteristics, and (3) geographic distance. Pairwise correlations between matrices were significant in all cases when considering data pooled across time and habitats. A different pattern emerged when data were split according to season and disturbance level (i.e., primary vs. secondary habitats). Assemblage composition in primary habitats was correlated with geographic proximity of sites exclusively, indicating otherwise stochastic recruitment from a regional species pool at the local community level. In contrast, assemblage composition in secondary habitats was predictable based on environmental parameters, not geographical proximity. This can be inferred to be the result of a strong local site filter effect (i.e., physiologically more-restrictive conditions within secondary forest habitats, especially due to an altered microclimate). Results were consistent throughout seasons. The observed transition in predictability patterns indicates that anthropogenic disturbance not only affects system descriptors, such as species richness, abundance, and diversity, but may also alter the system's dynamics.

AB Life-history theory posits causal links from an organism's phenotype (e.g., its body size and condition) to its reproductive output (e.g., offspring size and number) and thence to its microevolutionary fitness. However, few empirical data are available to quantify such links, especially for tropical organisms. Oviposition by field-caught keelback snakes (Tropidonophis mairii, Colubridae) in tropical Australia yielded data on clutches from 318 adult females (3151 eggs) over three years, and mark-recapture studies (1804 nights surveyed) quantified survival rates of neonates from those laboratory-incubated clutches. Path analysis revealed strong links between maternal phenotype, reproductive output, and fitness, and these links were consistent among years and across different parts of the nesting period. Although all eggs were incubated at standard water potentials, clutches varied considerably in the amount of water uptake by eggs during incubation. Hatchling body length was influenced more by the egg's water uptake than by its initial mass. Larger offspring were more likely to survive their first year of life. Overall, the rate of water uptake by a female's eggs was more important for her reproductive success (number of surviving progeny) than were variables such as mean, egg mass. Hence, this population experiences intense selection not only on "conventional" life-history traits such as egg size and number, but also on maternal nest-site choice and on the physiological mechanisms that control water exchange between the egg and the nest substrate.

AB (I)n the recently radiated genus Inga (Fabaceae), few nucleotide substitutions have accumulated among species, yet large divergences have occurred in defensive phenotypes, suggesting strong selection by herbivores. We compared herbivory and defenses of young leaves for L goldmanii, a more derived species that follows a "defense" strategy, and L unibellifera, a more basal species that follows an "escape" strategy. The two species suffered similar rates of herbivory (22% of the leaf area eaten during expansion) but were attacked by different communities of herbivores. I. goldinanii relied heavily on extra-floral nectaries and on a diversity of effective secondary metabolites, while I. umbellfera minimized damage through rapid leaf expansion and synchronous flushing. The major classes of secondary compounds in both species were flavanoids and non-protein amino acids; however, there were large differences in structure, biosynthetic pathways, and efficacy against herbivores. Growth rates of lepidopteran larvae were significantly lower when fed artificial diets with crude extracts from L goldmanii as compared to L umbellifera. Flavanoids accounted for the majority of growth reduction in both species. L umbellifera had more unusual flavanoids and a non-protein amino acid not reported from plants, but the more common flavanoids found in L goldinanii were more bioactive against herbivores. I. goldmanii also had greater ant visitation to extrafloral nectaries, suggesting that there was no trade-off between biotic and chemical defenses. In contrast, young leaves of L umbellifera expanded more rapidly, minimizing the window of vulnerability before toughening. Resources for rapid expansion may have been reallocated from chloroplast development as L umbellifera delayed the greening process until after full leaf expansion. Leaves were also produced synchronously, which can satiate herbivores and reduce damage. These defense differences are reflected in almost completely nonoverlapping herbivore faunas and the more frequent occurrence of generalists on L umbellifera. To understand why defenses have evolved, it is important to view them in light of the herbivore community as well as in the context of the other co-occurring traits. We hypothesize that the effectiveness of chemical defenses determines whether a species follows the evolutionary path of "defense" or "escape" strategies.

AB Infectious diseases can bring, about population declines and local host extinctions, contributing significantly to the global biodiversity crisis. Nonetheless, studies measuring population-level effects of pathogens in wild host populations are rare, and taxonomically biased toward avian hosts and macroparasitic infections. We investigated the effects of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), caused by the bacterial pathogen. Mycobacterium bovis, on African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) at Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa. We tested 1180 buffalo for bTB infection between May 2000 and November 2001. Most infections were mild, confirming the chronic nature of the disease in buffalo. However, our data indicate that bTB affects both adult survival and fecundity. Using an age-structured population model, we demonstrate that the pathogen can reduce population growth rate drastically; yet its effects appear difficult to detect at the population level: bTB causes no conspicuous mass mortalities or fast population declines, nor does it alter host-population age structure significantly. Our models suggest that this syndrome-low detectability coupled with severe impacts on population growth rate and, therefore, resilience-may be characteristic of chronic diseases in large mammals.

AB Large-scale biogeographic patterns in marine systems are considerably less well documented and understood than those in terrestrial systems. Here, we synthesize recent evidence on latitudinal and bathymetric gradients of species diversity in benthic mollusks, one of the most diverse and intensively studied marine taxa. Latitudinal gradients in coastal faunas show poleward declines in diversity, but the patterns are highly asymmetrical between hemispheres, and irregular both within and among regions. The extensive fossil record of mollusks reveals that latitudinal gradients have become steeper during the Neogene, partly because of a rapid diversification in tropical coral reefs and their associated biotas. Much of the inter-regional variation in contemporary latitudinal trends depends on the longitudinal distribution of reefs and major Neogene vicariant events. Thus, coastal faunas reveal a strong evolutionary-historical legacy. Bathymetric and latitudinal gradients in the deep ocean suggest that molluscan diversity is a function of the rate of nutrient input from surface production. Diversity may be depressed at abyssal depths because of extremely low rates of organic carbon flux, and at upper bathyal depths and high latitudes by pulsed nutrient loading. While the deep-sea environment is not conducive to fossilization, relationships between local and regional diversity, and the distribution and age of higher taxa indicate an evolutionary signal in present-day diversity gradients. Marine invertebrate communities offer tremendous potential to determine the relative importance of history and ecological opportunity in shaping large-scale patterns of species diversity.

AB Understanding the extent to which natural assemblages withstand changes in the regime of disturbance has considerable practical and theoretical interest. In this paper we examine the separate and interactive effects of intensity, temporal variation, and spatial extent of disturbance on temporal variance in assemblages of algae and invertebrates of rocky shores in the northwest Mediterranean. Temporal variation of disturbance is a predictor variable in the experiment, while temporal variance in abundance and number of taxa and in structure of assemblages are response variables. Multivariate analyses detected a positive relationship between intensity of disturbance and temporal variance in the structure of assemblages, while temporal variation of disturbance elicited the opposite effect. Univariate analyses conducted on the most abundant taxa revealed idiosyncratic patterns, while temporal variance in mean number of taxa was greatly reduced by disturbance, with no distinction among levels of intensity, temporal variation, or spatial extent. These outcomes suggest caution in interpreting the results of experiments in which intensity and temporal variation of disturbance cannot be separated. Distinguishing between these traits of disturbance may be key to predicting the ecological consequence of environmental fluctuations, including those expected under modified climate scenarios.

AB We sampled the understory community in an old-growth, temperate forest to test alternative hypotheses explaining the establishment of exotic plants. We quantified the individual and net importance of distance from areas of human disturbance, native plant diversity, and environmental gradients in determining exotic plant establishment. Distance from disturbed areas, both within and around the reserve, was not correlated to exotic species richness. Numbers of native and exotic species were positively correlated at large (50 m(2)) and small (10 m(2)) plot sizes, a trend that persisted when relationships to environmental gradients were controlled statistically. Both native and exotic species richness increased with soil pH and decreased along a gradient of increasing nitrate availability. Exotic species were restricted to the upper portion of the pH gradient and had individualistic responses to the availability of soil resources. These results are inconsistent with both the diversity-resistance and resource-enrichment hypotheses for invasibility. Environmental conditions favoring native species richness also favor exotic species richness, and competitive interactions with the native flora do not appear to limit the entry of additional species into the understory community at this site. It appears that exotic species with niche requirements poorly represented in the regional flora of native species may establish with relatively little resistance or consequence for native species richness.

AB Positive species interactions have the potential to strongly influence the structure and dynamics of ecological communities, yet surprisingly few studies have documented their general importance. We tested the hypothesis that the mutualistic association between fire ants and aphids enhances the impact of fire ants on the herbivorous and predaceous arthropod community of cotton. We found that the presence of aphids attracted foraging fire ants onto cotton plants. This shift from ground to foliar foraging resulted in more frequent interactions between fire ants and arthropods associated with cotton. The survival of herbivores (caterpillars) and predators (ladybird beetles and lacewings) was lower in the presence of fire ants and aphids compared with fire ants alone in greenhouse experiments. Similarly, fire ants and aphids deterred plant bugs from spending time on cotton foliage. Using large-scale field manipulations of fire ants along with naturally occurring aphid populations, we found that the ant-aphid mutualism accounted for much of the variation underlying ant impact on cotton herbivores and predators. For example, in 2001, similar to 27% of herbivore taxa and 54% of predator taxa were adversely affected by the mutualism. The overall community response, however, was highly conditional with strong temporal variation in the effects of the ant-aphid association. Our results indicate that the relationship between fire ants and aphids serves as a key interaction that alters the structure of cotton arthropod communities. This conclusion has far-reaching significance for understanding food web dynamics in natural systems and the efficacy of biological control in ant-infested areas.

AB Development of general theories and subsequent empirical testing are fundamental ingredients in ecological science. The progress of such efforts is determined by the logical coherence among central concepts, theories, and predictions on one hand, and experimental design, statistical analyses, and interpretation of results on the other. Here, we specifically explore an example of how differences in the way ecological concepts are defined lead to differences in the formulation and statistical testing of hypotheses and ultimately to differences in conclusions about the relative importance of ecological processes.
   In marine intertidal habitats, the notion that wave exposure has an important structuring role is widely agreed upon. Nevertheless, generalizations about its effects and use for accurate prediction of assemblages are often limited. This may partly be explained by the frequent use of categorical rather than quantitative definitions of wave exposure. We compared the conclusions about the importance of wave exposure from (1) analyses of variance based on relative classification of wave exposure and geographic location to those of (2) regression analyses based on continuous measures from 16 locations on the Swedish west coast.
   Variability in richness was substantially better explained by the regression analyses, while for the cover of individual taxa there was no consistent difference between the two analytical approaches in terms of explained variability. The two approaches detected significant spatial patterns for the same taxa, but conclusions about the nature of these patterns were often divergent. Categorical analyses of relative measures of wave exposure and geographic location indicated that interactive effects and differences between geographic areas were predominant. Regression analyses of absolute, continuous measures suggested that mean significant wave height was a better predictor than geographic location and interactive terms. Thus, the choice of definition of wave exposure has important consequences. for how causes of spatial patterns of intertidal assemblages are perceived. Categorical analyses appear to provide clearer indications as to which factors are important while the use of continuous predictors sometimes provides a better fit to the data. The consequences of these findings are discussed in the context of rocky shore ecology as well as in a general perspective of ecological models, hypotheses, experimentation, and analysis.

AB Current understanding of the extent, causes for, and consequences of variation in nutrient composition in plants is limited. Important questions to be addressed include to what extent nutrients covary, how flexible nutrient ratios are within a population or species, how reproduction influences nutrient ratios, and how much the ratios of nutrients to mass and nutrients to each other change through ontogeny. This information is needed to assess the physiological and ecological consequences of plant nutrient composition and to what extent plants function as balanced systems in acquisition and allocation of resources.
   We studied the variation in nutrient stoichiometry (i.e., the ratio between contents of different nutrients within a plant) in relation to three factors: (1) environmental availability of nitrogen, (2) plant size, and (3) reproductive status. We investigated these questions in 11 populations of the carnivorous plant Pinguicula vulgaris in northern Scandinavia. Dry mass and N and P content were measured for reproductive and vegetative portions of flowering individuals and for winter buds corresponding to four reproductive states: control reproductive individuals, experimentally vegetative individuals (from which flower buds were removed), adult vegetative individuals, and individuals below the threshold size for reproduction.
   [N], [P], and to a lesser extent, N and P content were positively related to soil N, but not to prey capture. Nutrient stoichiometry was also size dependent; in general, small plants were relatively enriched in N and relatively depleted in P compared to larger plants. Reproductive status affected not only size, but also nutrient stoichiometry of the resulting winter bud. Winter buds derived from reproductive individuals had a higher [N] and lower [P] than those of the different types of nonreproductive individuals. Our findings indicate that studies of nutrient stoichiometry in plants must go beyond links between environmental and plant nutrient concentrations to consider internal processes such as growth and reproduction.

AB Disturbance can directly affect the interactions among species at different trophic levels. Because disturbances are typically localized, and many consumers are constrained in their mobility, disturbances can generate spatial variability in trophic interactions. Here, we consider how fire alters plant-insect interactions in a longleaf pine ecosystem in central Florida, USA. We hypothesized that fire in the short term would directly depress herbivore abundance, and that the rate of re-colonization by herbivores would depend upon distance from the edge of the recently burned area. Thus, fire should generate spatially varying herbivory. Orthopterans are dominant insect consumers in our system, and many species are flightless, either as juveniles or adults; these species are particularly likely to show constrained post-fire mobility. We quantified insect abundance and herbivory levels on eight common understory plants in the, edge and interior of three recently burned sites. As predicted, insect abundance at the edge of burned areas was much higher than in the interior. In addition, all plant species experienced at least twice the level of herbivory in the edge than in the interior of burned sites. This demonstrates that disturbance can create strong spatial variation in the magnitude of trophic interactions. We suggest that larger burns may aid in plant management by reducing herbivory, whereas the presence of unburned refugia may be critical to insect conservation.

AB Marine reserves are being increasingly used to protect exploited marine species. However, blanket protection of species within a reserve may shelter nonindigenous species that are normally affected by harvesting, intensifying their impacts on native species. I studied a system of marine reserves in the San-Juan Islands, Washington, USA, to examine the extent to which marine reserves are invaded by nonindigenous species and the consequences of these invasions on native species. I surveyed three reserves and eight non-reserves to quantify the abundance of intertidal suspension-feeding clam species, three of which are regionally widespread nonindigenous species (Nuttallia obscurata, Mya arenaria, and Venerupis philippinarum). Neither total nonindigenous nor native species' abundance was significantly greater on reserves. However, the most heavily harvested species, V. philippinarum, was significantly more abundant on reserves, with the three reserves ranking highest in Venerupis biomass of all 11 sites. In contrast, a similar, harvested native species (Protothaca staminea) did not differ between reserves and non-reserves. I followed these surveys with a year-long field experiment replicated at six sites (the three reserves and three of the surveyed non-reserve sites). The experiment examined the effects of high Venerupis densities on mortality, growth, and fecundity of the confamilial Protothaca, and whether differences in predator abundance mitigate density-dependent effects. Even at densities 50% higher than measured in the field survey, Venerupis had no direct effect on itself or Protothaca; only site, predator exposure, and their interaction had significant effects. Analyses incorporating environmental variables tracked at each site indicated that crab biomass most heavily influenced clam responses, causing lower growth of both species and higher mortality of Venerupis, whose annualized loss rate was 50% when exposed to predators. A laboratory prey choice experiment indicated that Cancer productus, an influential intertidal crab predator, favored small adult Venerupis at least 1.7 times over Protothaca. Venerupis' high susceptibility to excavating crab and human predators, as well as its faster growth compared to Protothaca can be explained by its shallower burial depth. By growing quickly and residing near the surface, Venerupis apparently absorbs the brunt of harvest pressure while Protothaca maintains high biomass even outside of reserves.

AB Ecological and hydrological processes can interact strongly in landscapes, yet these processes are often studied separately. One particularly important interaction between these processes in patchy semiarid lands is how vegetation patches serve to obstruct runoff and then how this retained water increases patch growth that, in turn, provides feedbacks to the system. Such ecohydrological interactions have been mostly demonstrated for semiarid landscapes with distinctly banded vegetation patterns. In this paper, we use data from our studies and from the literature to evaluate how strongly four ecohydrological interactions apply across other patchy semiarid vegetations, and how these interactions are affected by disturbances. We specifically address four questions concerning ecohydrological interactions: (1) if vegetation patches obstruct runoff flows during rainfall events, how much more soil water is stored in these patches compared to open interpatch areas; (2) if inputs of water are higher in patches, how much stronger is the pulse of plant growth compared to interpatches; (3) if more soil water in patches promotes greater biological activity by organisms such as earthworms that create macropores, how much does this improve soil infiltrability; and (4) if vegetation patches are damaged on a hillslope, how much does this increase runoff and erosion and decrease biomass production? We used the trigger-transfer-reserve-pulse framework developed for Australian semiarid woodlands to put these four questions into a landscape context. For a variety of patchy semiarid vegetation types in Australia, Europe, and North America, we found that patches significantly stored more soil water, produced more growth and had better infiltrability than interpatches, and that runoff and erosion can markedly increase on disturbed hillslopes. However, these differences varied greatly and appeared to depend on factors such as the intensity and amount of input events (rainstorms) and type of topography, soils, and vegetation. Experimental and modeling studies are needed to better quantify how these factors specifically affect ecohydrological interactions. Our current findings do support the conclusion that vegetation patches and runoff-erosion processes do strongly interact in many semiarid landscapes across the globe, not just banded landscapes.

AB Within the northern Great Lakes region, mesoscale (10s to 100s of km(2)) forest patterning is driven by disturbance dynamics. Using original Public Land Survey (PLS) records in northern Wisconsin, USA, we study spatial patterns of wind and fire disturbances during the pre-Euroamerican settlement period (ca. 1850). Our goals were: (1) to determine how effectively wind and fire disturbance can be reconstructed from the PLS, (2) to assess the roles of wind and fire in shaping vegetation patterns, (3) to evaluate landscape to regional controls of wind and fire regimes, and (4) to assess the potential for interactions between these disturbances.
   Our analyses indicate that only relatively intense fire and wind disturbance can be reliably detected from the PLS (62-68% canopy removal). Heavy windthrow was more prevalent than fire disturbance in presettlement forests, and wind-disturbed patches were comparatively smaller and more complex in shape. Disturbance rotation periods ranged between 450 and 10 500 years for heavy windthrow and between 700 and 93 000 years for stand-replacing fire. Occurrences of wind and fire disturbance were related to geographic province and to regional soil patterns:, analysis further suggests a negative interaction between the two disturbance types.
   Given that severe wind disturbance was infrequent, mature to old forests of late-successional species dominated much of pre-Euroamerican northern Wisconsin, but wind disturbances may have allowed regional persistence of less shade-tolerant species, such as Betula alleghaniensis. Pine-dominated vegetation was limited to regions with more frequent fire, but frequencies of stand-replacing fire derived from Survey records were insufficient to maintain these successional vegetation types; we suggest that frequent surface fires, not recorded in the PLS, along with infrequent stand-replacing fire, maintained these vegetation 41 types.
   The extensive nature of the PLS provides a powerful baseline for addressing changes in forest conditions and disturbance regimes associated with climate and land use for both the present and more distant past. Such baselines are informative in discussions of historical variability and restoration silviculture.

AB The effects of search costs on habitat selection by dispersers are largely unknown. We explore how habitat selection behavior is affected by the risk of mortality en route and by deferred search costs (i.e., costs incurred during search that reduce fitness after arrival in the new habitat), using a model designed for long-distance natal dispersers searching for scarce patches of suitable habitat embedded within a matrix of unsuitable habitat. In this situation, increases in the risk of mortality during search reduce disperser selectivity, where selectivity is reflected by the period during search when dispersers are only willing to accept a high-quality habitat. However, the effects of deferred costs on selectivity depend on other factors with pronounced effects on selectivity, including encounter rates with high-quality habitats, relative habitat quality, and total search time. Surprisingly, under some sets of conditions, increases in deferred costs lead to increases in disperser selectivity. Overall, the effects of mortality and deferred costs on selectivity are small relative to the effects of other factors on selectivity. For instance, our model suggests that selectivity is much more strongly affected by total search time than by search costs, and it predicts a positive relationship between total search time and disperser selectivity across individuals in the same population, even in the face of considerable interindividual variation in risk of mortality or deferred search costs.

AB The relative roles of competition and predation in demographic density dependence are poorly known. A tractable experimental design to determine such effects and their interactions for demersal (seafloor oriented) fishes and similar sedentary species is cross-factoring multiple densities of new recruits with the presence and absence of predators. This design allows one to distinguish between density-dependent mortality due to competition alone, predation alone, or an interaction between the two, especially when supplemental field observations are available. To date, 14 species of marine fish have been examined with some variant of this design, and for 12 species predation was demonstrated to be the sole or major cause of density dependence. However, as competition may be slow acting relative to predation, the importance of competition can be underestimated in short-term experiments. On the Great Barrier Reef, we conducted a long-term field experiment in which multiple densities of new recruits of a planktivorous damselfish were cross-factored with the presence or absence of resident piscivorous fish on patch reefs. During the first 10,months, no density-dependent mortality was detected, regardless of whether resident predators were present or absent. By the end of the experiment at 17 months, per capita mortality was strongly density dependent and highly compensatory in both predator treatments; all reefs ultimately supported nearly the same adult density regardless of experimental treatment. Examination of treatment effect sizes suggested that competition was the main source of density-dependent mortality, with predation being merely a proximate agent of death. We hypothesize that predators were ineffective in this system compared with similar studies elsewhere because prey density was low relative to ample prey refuges provided by highly complex corals. Combined with previous studies, these findings indicate that density-dependent mortality in demersal marine fishes is often caused by interplay of predation and competition, whose roles may be altered by variation in habitat complexity and larval supply. These conclusions are relevant to marine fisheries models, which typically assume that density dependence is due solely to intraspecific competition.

AB Whole-lake additions of dissolved inorganic C-13 were used to measure allochthony (the terrestrial contribution of organic carbon to aquatic consumers) in two unproductive lakes (Paul and Peter Lakes in 2001), a nutrient-enriched lake (Peter Lake in 2002), and a dystrophic lake (Tuesday Lake in 2002). Three kinds of dynamic models were used to estimate allochthony: a process-rich, dual-isotope flow model based on mass balances of two carbon isotopes in 12 carbon pools; simple univariate time-series models driven by observed time courses of delta(CO2)-C-13; and multivariate autoregression models that combined information from time series of delta C-13 in several interacting carbon pools. All three models gave similar estimates of allochthony. In the three experiments without nutrient enrichment, flows of terrestrial carbon to dissolved and particulate organic carbon, zooplankton, Chaoborus, and fishes were substantial. For example, terrestrial sources accounted for more than half the carbon flow to juvenile and adult largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, golden shiners, brook sticklebacks, and fathead minnows in the unenriched experiments. Allochthony was highest in the dystrophic lake and lowest in the nutrient-enriched lake. Nutrient enrichment of Peter Lake decreased allochthony of zooplankton from 0.34-0.48 to 0-0.12, and of fishes from 0.51-0.80 to 0.25-0.55. These experiments show that lake ecosystem carbon cycles, including carbon flows to consumers, are heavily subsidized by organic carbon from the surrounding landscape.

AB Despite the important place of resource polymorphisms in ecological and evolutionary theories, the reason why a group of individuals sharing a common environment should diverge in the use of the resources remains poorly known. Given the existence of distinct open niches and the relaxation of interspecific competition, niche theory suggests two possible mechanisms: resource competition between conspecifics and trade-offs in resource use efficiency. We investigated the importance of these explanations in a foraging polymorphism recently developed by Zenaida Doves (Zenaida aurita) on the West Indian island of Barbados. In this polymorphism, individuals either aggressively defend feeding territories from conspecifics or feed in large unaggressive groups with conspecifics. Combining field observations and a cage experiment, we found no evidence that the polymorphism is primarily driven by age- or sex-related differences, or that it results from morphological feeding specializations or dietary preferences. Instead, our results support the hypothesis that individual specializations arise from contest competition. In the study area, competition for territories was intense, with very little undefended space left between territories and owners frequently involved in territorial contests. Replacement of territory holders from year to year was low compared to the number of potential recruits, implying that many doves were incapable of securing a territory. Approximately half the doves at territorial sites did not hold a territory but wandered between them as floaters. Compared with territory holders, floaters were smaller and had shorter wings, traits that in this species mediate territory defense. Yet floaters did not differ from group feeding doves on these morphological traits. This suggests that group feeders are floaters that shift to an alternative resource. The new resource appears to be suboptimal, as indicated by the fact that group feeders were in worse body condition than doves from the territorial sites. Taken together, our results suggest that the resource polymorphism in Zenaida Doves is primarily driven by competition for territories, which forces less competitive individuals to use alternative, subobtimal resources.

AB Coral bleaching is a stress-related response that can be triggered by elevated sea surface temperatures (SST). Recent increases in the frequency of coral bleaching have led to concerns that increases in marine temperatures may threaten entire coral reef regions. We report exponential increases in the geographical extent and intensity of coral bleaching in the Caribbean with increasing SST anomalies. A rise in regional SST of 0.1 degrees C results in 35% and 42% increases in the geographic extent and intensity of coral bleaching, respectively. Maximum bleaching extent and intensity are predicted to occur at regional SST anomalies of less than + 1 degrees C, which coincides with the most conservative projections for warming in the Caribbean by the end of the 21st century. Coral bleaching is therefore likely to become a chronic source of stress for Caribbean reefs in the near future.

AB With the advent of DNA-based molecular technologies, microbial ecologists now have the tools to test whether general ecological patterns apply to microorganisms. In this study, we selected 11 high-mountain lakes from Sierra Nevada (Spain) to test the predictions of island-biogeography theory in relation to ecosystem size and isolation, and to assess the influence of other factors (i.e., ecosystem productivity, resource richness, and biotic interactions) on bacterial community structure. Bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs), generated by denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis of polymerase chain-reaction-amplified 16S rRNA genes, were used as a surrogate of predominant "biodiversity units." OTU composition among lakes was heterogeneous, and the number of site-specific OTUs was near 50%. Lake remoteness did not affect the number of bacterial OTUs although the spatial distribution of the lakes significantly influenced bacterial composition. Lakes that were closer together had more similar bacterial fingerprints. We found a consistent positive association between bacterial OTU richness and lake area. The slope of this relationship (0.161 +/- 0.026, including literature data) was similar to slopes obtained for organisms with high dispersion rates.

AB Resources fluctuate in space and time, and animals routinely experience temporally varying opportunities for resource intake, and variation in intake itself. We investigate consequences of such variation in intake on growth and growth efficiency (growth per unit intake) in juvenile hybrid striped bass. We observed, after statistically accounting for the effects of total consumption and initial body size, that individuals receiving a low ration followed by a higher ration (the fluctuating ration) grew faster than individuals receiving a temporally constant ration (the normal ration). To interpret this increase in growth efficiency, we consider a set of alternative models representing different physiological hypotheses of the growth process. Using a simple growth model, an analytical result shows that the fluctuating ration as typically applied in experiments (a low ration followed by a high ration), independent of any change in physiology, increases growth efficiency relative to individuals on the normal ration. Growth efficiency increases because cumulative maintenance costs are lower for individuals that stay small initially and then grow rapidly in comparison to individuals that grow steadily. Further, a statistical analysis of alternative models inferred that fish receiving a variable ration show higher assimilation and/or conversion efficiencies of food and lower mass-specific maintenance costs. Our analysis suggests that the lower cumulative maintenance costs incurred over a time interval with low consumption followed by high consumption act in association with higher assimilation-conversion efficiencies, and lower overall mass-specific maintenance costs to increase growth efficiency in hybrid striped bass.

AB Hydraulic redistribution, the movement of water from soil layers of higher water potential to layers of lower water potential through the root systems of plants, has been documented in many taxa worldwide. Hydraulic redistribution is influenced principally by physical properties. of roots and soils, and it should occur whenever root systems span soil layers of different water potential. Therefore, hydraulic redistribution should occur through the root systems of plants with aboveground tissue removed or through the root systems of fully senesced plants as long as roots remain intact and hydrated. We examined our hypothesis in field and greenhouse studies with the annual grass Bromus tectorum. We used soil psychrometry to measure soil water potential and performed H-2-labeling experiments. In the field, following senescence of B. tectorum, we show substantial changes in soil water potential consistent with both upward and downward movement of water through roots. The amount of water redistributed represents a significant proportion of that which can be stored in the rooted zone. We also experimentally demonstrated upward movement of a H-2 label by roots of senesced plants and by roots of plants without aboveground tissues. In the greenhouse, we further demonstrated redistribution by senesced individuals using a H-2 label. Hydraulic redistribution through the roots of senesced plants should receive further attention because it may have important ecological consequences for soil water recharge, survival of plants through drought, and agricultural practices.

AB Cottonwoods (Populus spp.) represent an important tree component of riparian plant communities within the winter range of the northern Yellowstone elk (Cervus elaphus) herd, yet young cottonwoods are highly palatable to ungulates. To assess potential herbivory impacts associated with wild ungulates following the removal of gray wolves (Canis lupus), long-term cottonwood recruitment and stand dynamics were studied. While results indicated that the establishment of young cottonwoods is an ongoing process in Yellowstone's northern range, their relatively small stature and hedged appearance were indicative of high browsing pressure by wild ungulates, principally elk. At five study sites, the diameter at breast height (dbh) of all cottonwood trees >= 5 cm was determined; increment cores were also obtained for developing tree age vs. dbh relationships. At the La Duke Spring and Devils Slide Sites, which represent refugia sites since elk have limited access (due to local terrain conditions and cultural developments), cottonwood recruitment has been occurring during the last half century, indicating that climatic factors have not prevented cottonwood recruitment during that time. However, over this same period cottonwood recruitment no longer occurred at sites within the Soda Butte and Lamar Valleys. The overall decline in cottonwood recruitment at these locations occurred following the extirpation of wolves from Yellowstone National Park in the 1920s. At the Buffalo Ranch Site, where ranching of buffalo [bison] (Bison bison) and activities associated with culling of elk were centered, cottonwood recruitment continued after the loss of wolves but stopped following the curtailment of ungulate management activities at these facilities in the late 1960s. Taken together, data from the five sites reported herein along with the results of other studies provide compelling evidence that the absence of wolves in the northern Yellowstone has had a major impact on the recruitment of cottonwood and other woody browse species.

AB Riparian zones are habitats of critical conservation concern worldwide, as they are known to filter agricultural contaminants, buffer landscapes against erosion, and provide habitat for high numbers of species. Here we test the generality of the notion that riparian habitats harbor more species than adjacent upland habitats. Using previously published data collected from seven continents and including taxa ranging from Antarctic soil invertebrates to tropical rain forest lianas and primates, we show that riparian habitats do not harbor higher numbers of species, but rather support significantly different species pools altogether. In this way, riparian habitats increase regional (gamma-) richness across the globe by >50%, on average. Thus conservation planners can easily increase the number of species protected in a regional portfolio by simply including a river within terrestrial biodiversity reserves. Our analysis also suggests numerous possible improvements for future studies of species richness gradients across riparian and upland habitats. First, <15% of the studies in our analysis included estimates of more than one taxonomic group of interest. Second, within a given taxonomic group, studies employed variable methodologies and sampling areas in pursuit of richness and turnover estimates. Future analyses of species richness patterns in watersheds should aim to include a more comprehensive suite of taxonomic groups and should measure richness at multiple spatial scales.

AB We examined the population dynamics of two Antarctic seabirds and the influence of environmental variability over a 40-year period by coupling the estimation of demographic parameters, based on capture-recapture data, and modeling, using Leslie matrix population models. We demonstrated that the demographic parameters showing the greatest contribution to the variance of population growth rate were adult survival for both species. Breeding success showed the same contribution as adult survival for Emperor Penguins, whereas the proportion of breeders had the next stronger contribution for Snow Petrels.
   The sensitivity of population growth rate to adult survival was very high and the adult survival variability was weak for both species. Snow Petrel males survived better than females, whereas Emperor Penguin males had lower survival than females. These differences may be explained by the different investment in breeding. Emperor Penguin adult survival was negatively affected by air temperature during summer and winter for both sexes; male survival was negatively affected by sea ice concentration during summer, autumn, and winter. On the other hand, there was no effect of environmental covariates on Snow Petrel adult survival. The Emperor Penguin population has declined by 50% because of a decrease in adult survival related to a warming event during a regime shift in the late 1970s, whereas Snow Petrels showed their lowest numbers in 1976, but were able to skip reproduction.
   Indeed, the retrospective analysis of projection population matrix entries indicated that breeding abstention played a critical role in the population dynamics of Snow Petrels but not Emperor Penguins. Snow Petrels did not breed either when air temperature decreased during spring (probably reducing nest attendance and laying) or when sea ice decreased during autumn (reducing food availability).
   Emperor Penguin and Snow Petrel breeding population sizes were positively influenced by sea ice through its effect on adult survival for Emperor Penguins and on the proportion of breeders for Snow Petrels. Therefore, we hypothesize that the population sizes of the two species could be negatively affected by reduced sea ice in the context of global warming.

AB We investigated performance trade-offs among seedlings of nine tropical tree species during a -five-year field experiment. Seedlings were grown in eight microhabitat types composed of paired gap and shaded understory sites in each of four soil types. We defined performance trade-offs relevant to coexistence as significant pairwise rank reversals for species performance between contrasting situations, of which we characterize three types: microhabitat, fitness component, and ontogenetic. Only 2 of 36 species pairs exhibited microhabitat trade-offs or reversed rankings for survival or relative growth rate (RGR) among microhabitats, and only one species pair reversed performance ranks among soil types. We found stronger evidence for rank reversals between fitness components (survival and RGR), particularly in gap vs. understory environments, suggesting a general trade-off between shade tolerance (survival in shade) and gap establishment (RGR in gaps). Third, the most frequent rank reversals between species pairs occurred between early and later ontogenetic stages, especially between fitness components in contrasting microhabitats. Overall, 15 of 36 pairs of potentially competing species exhibited some type of seedling performance trade-off, two species pairs never outperformed one another, and for 19 species pairs one species was a consistent better performer. We suggest that ontogenetic trade-offs, in concert with microhabitat and fitness component trade-offs, may contribute to species coexistence of long-lived organisms such as tropical trees.

AB Environmental stochasticity is one of the premier features of population models used to forecast population persistence; however, most population viability analyses ignore interactions with other species. By contrast, theory in community ecology draws from a tradition of determinism: focusing on the processes (competition, predation) that promote the coexistence of groups of species (i.e., coexistence), while generally ignoring environmental variation in these processes (process noise or environmental stochasticity). Here I considered the role of deterministic and stochastic sources of variation in a predator-prey interaction on the probability of prey population extinction. Using discrete-time stochastic versions of a classic predator-prey model I show that even low levels of predator process noise increase the probability of prey extinction. Surprisingly, predator process noise has stronger negative effects on prey persistence than stochasticity in the population growth rate of the prey species itself. This conclusion is robust across a wide range of deterministic model behaviors, suggesting that the effects of stochastic variation in predator abundance on prey persistence may be pervasive. I then applied these insights to the management of endangered prey populations threatened by a nonnative predator and examined the relative efficacy of three predator control techniques at reviving declining prey populations. These techniques included immediate eradication and reduction of predator populations through either "proportional" harvest or "trigger" harvest. Under a proportional harvest regime, a constant proportion of predators were removed each year, with little attention paid to the natural variation experienced by predator populations. By contrast, I implemented trigger harvest by reducing predator abundance to a fixed threshold abundance level only in years in which the predator exceeds this harvest threshold. Trigger harvest reduces both the relative abundance and variance of predators, whereas proportional harvest only reduces the abundance of these species. My analysis suggests that the reduction of predator variance through trigger harvest can revive declining prey populations and, in some cases, revive them more effectively than a proportional reduction of predator abundance: the default control strategy when eradication cannot be achieved.

AB Latitudinal differences in life histories are believed to be underlain by differences in trade-offs between current and future reproduction. I report differences in tradeoffs between parent and offspring across the range of a widespread avian species, the Tree S wallow (Tachycineta bicolor). I manipulated parental effort and found that in Alaska, where yearly adult return rates are low, breeding females increase their reproductive investment to maintain offspring quality, whereas in Tennessee, where yearly adult return rates are high, breeding females are either unable or unwilling to increase reproductive investment and, consequently, raise offspring of lower quality. I further investigated a critical mechanism of self-maintenance that may underlie differences in survival among sites: immunocompetence. Females breeding in Alaska mounted weaker immune responses when raising enlarged broods, whereas females in Tennessee did not, further suggesting a strategy in Alaskan females to incur costs (i.e., reduce future reproduction) in order to maintain offspring quality. Insect availability increased as the breeding season progressed in both sites, but more food was available in Alaska than in Tennessee. This is among the first studies to report geographic differences in immune function consistent with life history theory, which predicts that individuals with higher survival probabilities should invest more in self-maintenance.

AB The recognition of behavior as a link between process and pattern in landscape ecology is exemplified by the concept of functional connectivity: the degree to which the landscape facilitates or impedes movement among resource patches. In this paper, I first argue that the actual operational definitions of this concept as applied to animal movement are not fully consistent with its formal definition. For instance, I question that a high likelihood of movement among the different points of primary habitat implies a high connectivity and contend that such a view can lead to misinterpretations. I also address two more hurdles to the measurement of functional connectivity: the fact that functional connectivity may not be equal along all axes and directions of movement and individual variation in functional connectivity within a given landscape. These points bring me to suggest that the concept of functional connectivity be bridged to the one of travel costs used in behavioral ecology. This would help define unequivocal operational definitions of functional connectivity as its measurement would then be dictated by its ecological role within specific models (e.g., travel costs within group membership models of foraging theory). I argue further that this ecological role shall in. turn determine the motivation underlying the movement of individuals, implying that the latter should preferably be standardized when measuring functional connectivity in the field. I finally present some methods to do so. These include translocation and playback experiments, food-titration and giving-up densities experiments, and manipulating feeding and breeding site locations and success.

AB Whereas the energetic costs of reproduction for female ungulates are well documented, those of males are not. We investigated age- and sex-specific changes in the kidney fat reserves of a large sample of Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus), a highly sexually dimorphic and polygynous mountain ungulate, during and following the mating period. Subadult male tahr (2-4 years old) obtain copulations opportunistically by "coursing," whereas adult males (> 4 years old) spend more time traveling and searching for females, and obtain copulations after engaging in more time-consuming "tending" and "blocking" displays. If there is a cost to these reproductive behaviors, we predicted that (1) the kidney fat index (KFI) of reproductive males ( >= 2 years old) should decline during the mating period relative to females and nonreproductive males, and (2) that the KFI of adult males should decline more than that of subadult males. We formulated our predictions into a series of candidate models, including three covariates also likely to affect fat reserves, and compared support for these models using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). The best-fitting model revealed that fat reserves in females and nonreproductive males changed similarly: Fat reserves increased during the mating period, in late autumn and early winter, reached a peak in mid-winter, and then declined throughout the remainder of winter and early spring. In contrast, the fat reserves of reproductive males declined during the mating period, as predicted, and remained low throughout winter. The extent of decline in fat reserves was greater in adult males than in subadult males, also as predicted. Our results strongly imply that male tahr incur a substantial energetic cost for engaging in reproduction and that they trade off reproductive success with reduced body condition during winter, which may lower survival.

AB Ecosystem responses to past climate change can provide insight into plausible scenarios of response to future change and can elucidate factors that may influence the overall predictability of such responses. I explore the utility of paleoecological studies for addressing questions about the predictability of ecosystem responses to climate change using Alaskan tree line ecosystems as a case study. Published studies were used to develop a regional analysis of patterns of recent tree line advance, and to estimate lags between recruitment onset and forest development beyond tree line. Tree line advance is ubiquitous, but asynchronous in time, occurring significantly earlier in the White Mountains in interior Alaska than in western Alaska or the Alaska Range. The mean lag between initiation of recruitment and forest development was estimated at approximately 200 years, similar to what modeling studies have found. Although continued advance of white spruce forests is the most likely scenario of future change, variability in the rate of forest response to warming may be likely due to limitation of spruce establishment in highly permafrost-affected sites, changes in seed dispersal and early establishment, and recent changes in the growth responses of individual trees to temperature. All of these factors may cause spruce populations to exhibit nonlinear responses to future warming, and uncritical extrapolation from recent trends is thus unwarranted.

AB Theoretical analyses have shown that the spatial scaling of environmental autocorrelation, strength of density regulation, and the dispersal of individuals determine the scaling of synchrony in population fluctuations. By modeling the separate effects of density regulation, environmental stochasticity, and demographic stochasticity, we estimate the spatial scaling of the component that is due to environmental stochasticity in the population dynamics of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in Norway.
   The estimated spatial scaling of the environmental noise was similar to 200 km. An examination of how different weather variables influenced the scaling indicated that snow depth was the major weather variable affecting the scaling of synchrony in population fluctuations, and was negatively related to population growth rates in 97.4% of the 151 populations included in the study. A large-scale climatic phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation, was positively related to population growth rates in 94.7% of the populations but did not significantly affect the pattern of synchrony among populations.
   We used newly developed theoretical results of the contribution of environmental noise and dispersal to the spatial scale of synchrony to show that the spatial scaling estimated in this study could not be explained by dispersal. This suggests that common environmental noise operating mainly during the winter is able to synchronize population fluctuations of roe deer over large distances.

AB Consideration of how trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) affect community dynamics is recognized as an important focus for ecological research. Although these indirect effects have been shown to mediate trophic cascades in ecological communities, our understanding of how habitat refuge influences the strength and direction of cascading effects is limited. We examined whether or not oyster toadfish (top predator) affect mud crab (intermediate predator) foraging on juvenile hard clams (infaunal prey) in oyster reefs, a physically complex habitat that can provide refuge for both intermediate predators and basal prey. In particular, we manipulated toadfish presence in mesocosms containing experimental oyster reefs and quantified both mud crab and juvenile clam mortality. Toadfish significantly reduced mud crab foraging on clams and increased clam survivorship even though mud crabs foraging on the surface of the reef sought refuge from toadfish deeper within the oyster-shell matrix where they were more proximal to clams. This counterintuitive result suggests, that toadfish suppression of mud crab foraging activity is far stronger than toadfish-avoidance behavior that potentially increases crab-clam encounter rates. Therefore, TMIIs can reinforce trophic cascades even in refuge habitats where intermediate predators and their prey are physically isolated from top predators. Determining the generality of cascading effects on lower trophic levels within refugia will require investigating how habitat refuge affects the relative importance of TMIIs.

AB We studied temporal partitioning between two spiny mouse species that coexist in hot rocky deserts in the Middle East: nocturnal common spiny mice (Acomys cahirinus) and diurnally active golden spiny mice (A. russatus). Although A. russatus is diurnally active, it retains the physical activity and body temperature rhythms of nocturnal mammals. We studied the two species in four 1000-m(2) enclosures at Ein Gedi, Israel: two experimental enclosures with A. russatus kept alone, and two controls with individuals of both species kept together. We monitored activity with Sherman traps and by studying foraging microhabitat use and efficiency using giving-up densities (GUDs) in food trays. The trays contained broken sunflower seeds mixed in local soil and placed in three microhabitats: under boulders, between boulders, and in the open. Trapping revealed that, in the absence of A. cahirinus, the usually diurnal A. russatus was active both day and night. However, during the day A. russatus still foraged in significantly more patches and to significantly lower GUDs than during the night. Both species, but in particular A. russatus, preferred to forage in the boulder habitat. Spiny mice foraged in the same number of trays in the under- and between-boulder microhabitats, but to lower GUDs in the under-boulder microhabitat, both during the day (A. russatus) and during the night (both species). The nocturnal A. cahirinus exploited more patches with greater efficiency than did A. russatus either during the day or during the night. This result suggests that foraging trade-offs that give each species a competitive advantage along some portion of the resource axis cannot be a mechanism of nocturnal coexistence between the two species. Perhaps this is why A. russatus resorts to diurnal activity in this hot rocky desert and why the otherwise rare mechanism of temporal partitioning occurs for these species.

AB Accelerated nitrogen (N) inputs can drive nonlinear changes in N cycling, retention, and loss in forest ecosystems. Nitrogen processing in soils is critical to understanding these changes, since soils typically are the largest N sink in forests. To elucidate soil mechanisms that underlie shifts in N cycling across a wide gradient of N supply, we added (NH4NO3)-N-15-N-15 at nine treatment levels ranging in geometric sequence from 0.2 kg to 640 kg N(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1) to an unpolluted old-growth temperate forest in southern Chile. We recovered roughly half of N-15 tracers in 0-25 cm of soil, primarily in the surface 10 cm. Low to moderate rates of N supply failed to stimulate N leaching, which suggests that most unrecovered N-15 was transferred from soils to unmeasured sinks above ground. However, soil solution losses of nitrate in creased sharply at inputs > 160 kg N(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1), corresponding to a threshold of elevated soil N availability and declining N-15 retention in soil. Soil organic matter (<5.6 mm) dominated tracer retention at low rates of N input, but coarse roots and particulate organic matter became increasingly important at higher N supply. Coarse roots and particulate organic matter together accounted for 38% of recovered N-15 in soils at the highest N inputs and may explain a substantial fraction of the "missing N" often reported in studies of fates of N inputs to forests.
   Contrary to expectations, N additions did not stimulate gross N cycling, potential nitrification, or ammonium oxidizer populations. Our results indicate that the nonlinearity in N retention and loss resulted directly from excessive N supply relative to sinks, independent of plant-soil-microbial feedbacks. However, N additions did induce a sharp decrease in microbial biomass C:N that is predicted by N saturation theory, and which could increase long-term N storage in soil organic matter by lowering the critical C:N ratio for net N mineralization. All measured sinks accumulated N-15 tracers across the full gradient of N supply, suggesting that short-term nonlinearity in N retention resulted from saturation of uptake kinetics, not uptake capacity, in plant, soil, and microbial pools.

AB Pollinators may choose which flowers to visit by direct assessment of rewards or by indirect assessment of "honest" advertisements or other traits correlated with the quantity or quality of reward. We wished to know whether selection generated by pollinators acted directly or indirectly on floral rewards, on advertisement traits, and/or traits affecting pollinator efficiency (their fit with flowers) in Dalechampia vines (Euphorbiaceae) and whether the advertisement (bract size) was correlated honestly with reward amount (measured by resin-gland area). In Gabon we studied bee visitation and pollen arrival rates to blossoms of D. ipomoefolia Benth. and found that, despite the apparent visibility of the resin reward (and its volume), the strongest bee-mediated natural selection acted directly on bract size rather than gland area. Blossoms with larger bracts were visited more often by the only pollinators, female Heriades nr. spiniscutis (Apoidea: Megachilidae), and these blossoms received more pollen on their stigmas. Blossoms with larger resin glands were also visited more often and received more pollen overall, but this effect disappeared when bract size (which was phenotypically correlated with gland size) was controlled for statistically. These observational data were confirmed by experimental reduction of bract size, which significantly decreased pollen arrival rates. Thus, the bees appear to rely on the "honest'' correlation between advertisement and reward in choosing the best blossoms to visit, and this behavior generates direct selection for larger bracts and indirect selection for larger resin glands. Bees visiting blossoms with larger separation between the gland and stigmas contacted the stigmas less frequently, and such blossoms received less pollen on their stigmas. Because gland area, bract size, and gland-stigma separation are positively correlated phenotypically, response to selection for larger bracts may be limited in this population by conflicting selection against large gland-stigma separation.

AB Chytridiomycosis is an emerging infectious disease that has recently been reported in amphibian populations throughout the world. It has been associated with many cases of population declines and extinctions. In some areas of the Sierra Nevada of California the disease appears to be the causal factor in the rapid extinction of local populations of the mountain yellow-legged frog, Rana muscosa, within a few years of the first detection of the disease. In other areas, however, R. muscosa populations appear to persist for many years, despite high levels of infection in tadpoles. Here we present simple models of the dynamics of the disease within an individual lake and ask whether our current understanding of the disease is consistent with the field survey observations of: (a) extinction due to the disease over a wide range of host population sizes, and (b) persistence of frog populations with the disease at some sites. Despite our laboratory observation of chytridiomycosis being invariably lethal to postmetamorphic frogs, the observed long-term persistence of infected frog populations can only be explained if at least some infected adult frogs survive and reproduce.

AB Phenotypic differences among species, even closely related species, may translate into distinct effects on ecosystem dynamics. In lakes, the generalist grazer genus Daphnia often has marked effects on the abundance of primary producers, the rate of primary production, and rates of nutrient cycling. The effects are particularly distinct during the clear-water phase (CWP) when algal biomass is driven to extremely low values as Daphnia densities undergo an annual population increase. Here we show that the timing of the CWP in Onondaga Lake, New York, USA, has depended upon which Daphnia species were present in the water column. An analysis of the ephippia and diapausing eggs from the sediments reveals that long-term changes in the zooplankton species assemblage tracks a history of chemical (especially salt waste) pollution. Prior to 1930 the assemblage was dominated by native D. pulicaria and D. ambigua. From 1930 to 1980, these species were replaced by D. exilis and D. curvirostris, two salinity-tolerant exotic species native to shallow salt pools of the southwestern United States and coastal brackish ponds of Europe, respectively. As industry was progressively shut down by government action over the period from the 1970s to the 1980s, the exotic species disappeared, and the two native taxa returned (plus D. galeata mendotae, which is also native to the region). As we have shown previously, the exotic species were identified either by hatching and rearing diapausing eggs (D. exilis) or by analysis of eggs using mtDNA (D. curvirostris). We interpret their role in seasonal algal dynamics in Onondaga Lake retrospectively using data collected in prior studies of the lake. The native Daphnia currently cause a typical spring CWP in late May and early June, whereas the exotic species caused an unusual late-summer (August-October) CWP during the period of maximum cyanobacterial density.

AB The carnivorous pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea receives nutrients from both captured prey and atmospheric deposition, making it a good subject for the study of ecological stoichiometry and nutrient limitation. We added prey in a manipulative field experiment and measured nutrient accumulation in pitcher-plant tissue and pitcher liquid, as well as changes in plant morphology, growth, and photosynthetic rate. Prey addition had no effect on traditional measures of nutrient limitation (leaf morphology, growth, or photosynthetic rate). However, stoichiometric measures of nutrient limitation were affected, as the concentration of both N and P in the leaf tissue increased with the addition of prey. Pitcher fluid pH and nitrate concentration did not vary among treatments, although dissolved oxygen levels decreased and ammonia levels increased with prey addition. Ratios of N:P, N:K, and K:P in pitcher-plant tissues suggest that prey additions shifted these carnivorous plants from P limitation under ambient conditions to N limitation with the addition of prey.

AB Two of the principal explanations for regional population synchrony, largescale environmental variability and dispersal, have received considerable theoretical attention. Although time series analysis has helped to validate the relative importance of these two explanations, very little of this theory has been confirmed by experiment. Here, we demonstrate the dual synchronizing effect of dispersal and temporal environmental variation. We used an experimental model system based on the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and its algal prey Chlorella vulgaris. We constructed temporal prey fluctuations with two periodic components that matched the generation time and life span of the rotifer. By varying the amplitude of these two periods we created prey variability with "white" (both periods had equal power) and "red" (the longest period had greatest power) spectra. In the absence of dispersal only the red fluctuations induced synchrony in the population dynamics of the rotifer. Dispersal had a strong and rapid synchronizing effect. The combination of red (but not white) fluctuations and dispersal resulted in the highest levels of synchrony. These results confirm the predictions of recent theory, but they also suggest that the temporal structure of environmental variability determines its capacity to synchronize population dynamics over large spatial scales.

AB The invasion of natural and anthropogenic habitats by alien plants is a global problem. To understand the factors that regulate the success of alien plant species we sampled alien plant biomass and species composition in 66 sites representing a wide variety of habitat types within Bruce Peninsula National Park, Ontario, Canada. We quantified the response of existing alien biomass to a suite of habitat variables including habitat productivity, standing biomass, species richness, soil nutrients and disturbance factors. Standing biomass in the sites varied from 0 to nearly 60000 g/m(2) and annual productivity ranged from 0 to nearly 800 g(.)m(-2.)yr(-1). The response of both absolute and relative alien biomass (dominance) to the independent variables was assessed using univariate plots and multivariate canonical correspondence analysis. The results show that total standing alien biomass and site disturbance history can predict alien dominance, but other factors including primary productivity, nutrient levels, and site species richness cannot. In the multivariate analysis, species composition of both aliens and natives, was best explained by nutrient levels, disturbance type, biomass, and, to a lesser extent, productivity. The study illustrates the value of examining both absolute abundance and dominance of aliens across a broad array of habitat types, and in the context of a large suite of possible driving functions.

   ZONE; ORINOCO RIVER; STREAM
AB Flood pulse inundation of riparian forests alters rates of nutrient retention and organic matter processing in the aquatic ecosystems formed in the forest interior. Along the Middle Rio Grande (New Mexico, USA), impoundment and levee construction have created riparian forests that differ in their inter-flood intervals (IFIs) because some floodplains are still regularly inundated by the flood pulse (i.e., connected), while other floodplains remain isolated from flooding (i.e., disconnected).
   This research investigates how ecosystem responses to the flood pulse relate to forest IFI by quantifying nutrient and organic matter dynamics in the Rio Grande floodplain during three years of experimental flooding of the disconnected floodplain and during a single year of natural flooding of the connected floodplain. Surface and subsurface conditions in paired sites (control, flood) established in the two floodplain types were monitored to address metabolic and biogeochemical responses.
   Compared to dry controls, rates of respiration in the flooded sites increased by up to three orders of magnitude during the flood pulse. In the disconnected forest, month-long experimental floods produced widespread anoxia of four-week duration during each of the three years of flooding. In contrast, water in the connected floodplain remained well oxygenated (3-8 ppm). Material budgets for experimental floods showed the disconnected floodplain to be a sink for inorganic nitrogen and suspended solids, but a potential source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Compared to the main stem of the Rio Grande, floodwater on the connected floodplain contained less nitrate, but comparable concentrations of DOC, phosphate-phosphorus, and ammonium-nitrogen.
   Results suggest that floodplain IFI drives metabolic and biogeochemical responses during the flood pulse. Impoundment and fragmentation have altered floodplains from a mosaic of patches with variable IFI to a bimodal distribution. Relatively predictable flooding occurs in the connected forest, while inundation of the disconnected forest occurs only as the result of managed application of water. In semiarid floodplains, water is scarce except during the flood pulse. Ecosystem responses to the flood pulse are related to the IFI and other measures of flooding history that help describe spatial variation in ecosystem function.

AB Understanding global biodiversity patterns requires analyses at multiple spatial and temporal scales, across a variety of different habitat types. We used a highly replicated study in coastal Ecuador to examine simultaneously for the first time spatial and temporal species turnover and the contribution of five different habitat types (rice, pasture, coffee agroforests, abandoned coffee agroforests, and native forest fragments) to regional diversity in the tropics, using the experimental placement of standardized nesting structures for bees and wasps. There was notable overlap in the communities of different habitat types, indicating that even intensively managed land can provide a valuable contribution to the overall biodiversity of the landscape mosaic. Importantly, there was a significant effect of habitat type on temporal variation in diversity. While intensive cropping systems such as rice and pasture exhibited higher diversity in certain months, greater species turnover through time in the abandoned coffee and forest plots accounted for the higher overall diversity in these habitats. Overall, spatial and temporal turnover explained 38.6% and 23.1%, respectively, of partitioned regional species richness. A quantitative analysis revealed that the relative habitat specificity of Hymenoptera decreased with increasing habitat disturbance.

AB Despite recent advances in the study of invasive, normative species, we still understand very little about the variability of their population dynamics over space and time, and the processes that contribute to their demographic success. The goal of this study was to quantify the population dynamics of the invasive, subtropical shrub, Ardisia elliptica (Myrsinaceae), growing in a disturbed area of Everglades National Park, Florida, USA. We used bootstrap sampling and randomization tests to test hypotheses about spatial and temporal variation in population. dynamics. Five populations spanning a range of habitats were studied for three years. Significant spatial and temporal variation in fruit production, relative growth, fates of vegetative individuals, and population growth rates were detected; however, spatial variation among populations had an overall stronger effect than temporal variation. Population growth rates were greater than 1 or not different from 1, implying that populations are on average increasing in size. Similar to most other shrubs, prospective analysis showed that stasis of large stage classes had the highest elasticities. However, a retrospective analysis indicated that it was variation in growth to larger stage classes that contributed the most to observed variation in population growth rates. Simulations suggest that historically higher population growth rates of A. elliptica were necessary to produce current population sizes in Everglades National Park.

AB We have investigated food choice in individual fallow deer (Dama dama) encountering different relative frequencies of food types in the form of bowls containing pellets with either high or low concentrations of hydrolyzable tannin. We performed two similar experiments, one with large and one with small differences in tannic acid concentration. With small differences in tannic acid concentration, the ratio of the consumption per low- and high-tannin bowl was independent of frequency of occurrence, but with large differences in tannic acid concentration, we found frequency-dependent food choice. The deer ate proportionally less from high-tannin bowls if these occurred at low relative frequency. Variation between frequency treatments in the average order of encounter of bowl types might have produced this effect, because we found that the deer left a high-tannin bowl more quickly if they had switched to it from a low-tannin bowl. We argue that the perceived contrast between the tastes of different food types can play a role for food choice by mammalian herbivores.

AB We use stomach contents and stable isotope ratios of predatory fishes, collected over a 10-year time span from a species-rich river in Venezuela, to examine potential body-size-trophic-position relationships. Mean body size of predator taxa and their prey (determined by stomach content analyses) were significantly correlated, but trophic position of predators (estimated by stable isotope ratios) was not correlated with body size. This reflects no apparent relationship between body size and trophic position among prey taxa. Primary consumer taxa (algivores and detritivores) in this system are characterized by diverse size and morphology, and thus predatory fish of all body sizes and feeding strategies are able to exploit taxa feeding low in the food web. Regardless of relative body size, predators exploit short, productive food chains. For any given food chain within a complex web where predators are larger than their prey, trophic position and body size are necessarily correlated. But in diverse food webs characterized by a broad range of primary consumer body size, apparently there is no relationship between trophic position and body size across all taxa in the web.

AB Trophic interactions in cryptic belowground systems are difficult to assess, either experimentally or by direct observation. We used lipid analysis to determine feeding strategies in Collembola raised on various bacteria], fungal, plant, or nematode diets. Dietary fatty acids (FAs) were conserved and transferred through the trophic cascade into the neutral lipids of consumers. The presence of vaccenic type FAs (omega 7 family) was indicative of a bacterial diet in general. More specifically, methyl-branched (iso, anteiso) and cyclic forms of FAs were markers for consumption of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. Fungal-feeding Collembola comprised a higher proportion of linoleic acid, whereas the profile of plant feeders showed an increased amount of oleic acid. The FA 20:1 omega 9 was only present in Collembola with nematodes as prey. Based on the assigned marker FAs, field populations of Collembola in three deciduous forest stands were ascribed to feeding guilds (i.e., fungivores, bacterivores, herbivores, predators). In conclusion, FA biomarkers provide a high-resolution method to define feeding strategies of decomposer invertebrates and to determine their diets in situ. Lipid analysis has considerable potential as a new tool in soil food web studies.

AB The issue of scaling impinges on every aspect of landscape ecology and much of ecology in general. Consequently, the topic has invited a vast commentary. One result of scaling research is so-called scaling laws that describe how observations scale (e.g., as power laws). Importantly, such scaling rules seldom derive from a process-based understanding of why they emerge. Alternatively, the task of scaling is often addressed via simulation models. This is a scaling operation about which we are somewhat less confident, although recent advances in computing power and computational statistics provide for some promising new solutions. Here, I focus on methods for scaling simulations developed at fine grain and small extent, to their implications over much larger extent. The intent in scaling is to simplify the model while retaining those details essential for larger-scale applications. This approach should lead to scaling rules that are well founded in fine-scale ecological process and yet useful for making predictions at the larger scales of management and environmental policy.

AB Historically, carbon limitation, through a shortage of photoassimilates has been argued to limit the growth of trees at the upper altitudinal treeline. In a three-year free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment, two species of 30-year-old alpine conifers (Larix decidua and Pinus uncinata) were studied to test this hypothesis in situ in the Swiss Central Alps (2180 m above sea level). CO2 enrichment was combined with foliage removal to test the effect of altered source-sink relationships on tree growth and leaf level responses. Elevated CO2 enhanced photosynthesis and increased nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations in the needles of both species. While the deciduous larch trees showed longer needles and a stimulation of shoot growth over all three seasons when grown in situ under elevated CO2, pine trees showed no such responses. Irrespective of CO2 concentration, defoliation in both species stimulated photosynthesis and increased stomatal conductance in remaining current-year needles in the treatment year and reduced leaf nitrogen concentration in the year following defoliation. Defoliated larch trees had fewer and shorter needles with reduced NSC concentrations in the year following defoliation and showed no stimulation in shoot elongation when exposed to elevated CO2. In contrast, defoliation of evergreen pine trees had no effect on needle NSC concentrations, but stimulated shoot elongation when defoliated trees were exposed to elevated CO2. After three years, our results suggest that deciduous larch is carbon limited at treeline, while evergreen pine is not. However, as indicated by the defoliation treatment, the carbon economy of these trees can clearly be modified by extreme events. The expected changes in growth of these treeline trees with improving carbon availability as atmospheric CO2 continues to increase will thus depend on both the interplay between biotic and abiotic processes, and the species or tree functional types involved.

AB Spatial aggregations arising from social behavior or habitat patchiness are common in nature and have important implications for population dynamics, community stability, and conservation. Distinguishing between these behavioral and environmental causes of pattern is of general interest to spatial ecologists and continues to be a key unresolved issue. Despite the importance of this problem, systematic approaches for resolving the underlying mechanisms are not well developed. We demonstrate here the value of a three-tiered systematic approach involving descriptive spatial sampling, individual-based observation and diffusion modeling, and manipulative field experiments. We used this approach to test social- vs. habitat-driven hypotheses explaining spatial aggregation in the collembolan Orchesella hexfasciata. Our results show that aggregation is a gregarious behavior triggered by seasonal increases in soil moisture. Initial field observations suggested that aggregation was habitat driven and associated with soil moisture, but individual-based observations and modeling revealed that Moisture was only a triggering mechanism for socially driven aggregation. This was corroborated in field experiments by testing hypotheses that were motivated by the individual-based analyses. Thus, the three-tiered approach led to a more complete understanding of aggregation than would any single technique.

AB For many animals, selecting whether to fora e during day or night is a critical fitness problem: at night, predation risks are lower but feeding is less efficient. Habitat selection is a closely related problem: the best location for nocturnal foraging could be too risky during daytime, and habitat that is safe and profitable in daytime may be unprofitable at night. We pose a theory that assumes animals select the combination of daytime and night activity (feeding vs. hiding), and habitat, that maximizes expected future fitness. Expected fitness is approximated as the predicted probability of surviving starvation and predation over a future time horizon, multiplied by a function representing the fitness benefits of growth. The theory ' s usefulness and generality were tested using pattern-oriented analysis of an individual-based model (IBM) of stream salmonoids and the extensive literature on observed diel behavior patterns of these animals. Simulation experiments showed that the IBM reproduces eight diverse patterns observed in real populations. (1) Diet activity (whether foraging occurs during day and/or night) varies among a population ' s individuals, and from day to day for each individual. (2) Salmonids feed in shallower and slower water at night. (3) Individuals pack more tightly into the best habitat when feeding at night. (4) Salmonids feed relatively more at night if temperatures (and, therefore, metabolic demands) are low. (5) Daytime feeding is more common for life stages in which potential fitness increases more rapidly with growth. (6) Competition for feeding or hiding sites can shift foraging between day and night. (7) Daytime feeding is more common when food availability is low. (8) Diet activity patterns are affected by the availability of good habitat for feeding or hiding, We can explain many patterns of variation in diel foraging behavior without assuming that populations or individuals vary in how inherently nocturnal or diurnal they are. Instead, these patterns can emerge from the search by individuals for good trade-offs between growth and survival under different habitat and competitive conditions.

AB An economy of scale may lead to selection to increase interannual variation in seed production when the per seed probability of seedling establishment. increases with seed production. Variable annual seedfall will, however, reduce this probability when post-dispersal seed fate is negatively density dependent on the local density of seeds, and seed dispersal and density dependence act identically across years. Intuitively, more variable annual seedfall causes the representative seed to experience a greater density of conspecific seeds and suffer greater density-dependent effects. This handicap must be overcome for the per seed probability of recruitment to be greater in years with greater seed production.
   We quantified spatial and annual variation in seedfall and seedling recruitment, evaluated density dependence and economies of scale during the seed-to-seedling transition, and investigated the synergistic consequences of density dependence and variable annual seedfall for seedling recruitment on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Weekly censuses of 200 0.5-m(2) seed traps documented seedfall for 15 years and 108 plant species. Annual censuses of 600 1-m(2) seedling plots documented recruitment for nine years and 32 species. The density of seedling recruits tended to increase with the density of seeds; however, the per seed probability of recruitment invariably decreased with seedfall density. Negative density dependence characterized the seed-to-seedling transition. Observed levels of spatial and interannual variation in seedfall density would reduce long-term recruitment by up to 28% if negatively density-dependent survival acted identically across years; however, the strength of negative density dependence varied significantly among years for 12 of 32 species. Negative density dependence occurred in all years for these species but was significantly weaker during the one or two years of greatest seedfall than during the remaining years of lower seedfall. The per seed probability of recruitment increased significantly with annual seedfall for eight of these species. These eight species realized postdispersal economies of scale despite the reduction in long-term recruitment expected from the synergism between variable annual seed production and negatively density-dependent seed fate.

AB In the tropical forests of Central and South America, army ants of the Ecitonini tribe, and the numerous animals that follow them through the understory, share a complex relationship that has far-reaching effects on population dynamics and community structure. Although considerable study has been made of various participants in this relationship, no research has explicitly examined the nature of the interaction between the ants and the most important group of followers, the ant-following birds. Here we show, through use of exclusion experiments, that ant-following birds are parasites on Eciton burchellii, significantly reducing the ants' success rate in capturing prey. This has important implications for our interpretation of ant behaviors during swarm-raiding, competitive interactions among the ant-following birds, and possibly also the relative abundance of those social hymenopterans that are typically preyed upon by army ants.

AB Increases in the abundance or density of woody plants in historically semiarid and arid grassland ecosystems have important ecological, hydrological, and socioeconomic implications. Using a simplified water-balance model, we propose a framework for conceptualizing how woody plant encroachment is likely to affect components of the water cycle within these ecosystems. We focus in particular on streamflow and the partitioning of evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration. On the basis of this framework, we Suggest that streamflow and evaporation processes are affected by woody plant encroachment in different ways, depending on the degree and seasonality of aridity and the availability of subsurface water. Differences in landscape physiography, climate, and runoff mechanisms mediate the influence of woody plants on hydrological processes. Streamflow is expected to decline as a result of woody plant encroachment in landscapes dominated by subsurface flow regimes. Similarly, encroachment of woody plants can be expected to produce an increase in the fractional contribution of bare soil evaporation to evapotranspiration in semiarid ecosystems, Whereas such shifts may be small or negligible in both subhumid and and ecosystems. This framework for considering the effects of woody plant encroachment highlights important ecological and hydrological interactions that serve as a basis for predicting other ecological aspects of vegetation change-such as potential changes in carbon cycling within an ecosystem. In locations where woody plant encroachment results in increased plant transpiration and concurrently the availability of soil water is reduced, increased accumulation of carbon in soils emerges as one prediction. Thus, explicitly considering the ecohydrological linkages associated with vegetation change provides needed information on the consequences of woody plant encroachment on water yield, carbon cycling, and other processes.

AB Predation is a central feature of ecological communities. Most theoretical and empirical studies of predation focus on the consequences of predators consuming their prey. Predators reduce prey population densities through direct consumption (a density-mediated interaction, DMI), a process that may indirectly affect the prey's resources, competitors, and other predators. However, predators can also affect prey population density by stimulating costly defensive strategies. The costs of these defensive strategies can include reduced energy income, energetic investment in defensive structures, lower mating success, increased vulnerability to other predators, or emigration. Theoretical and empirical studies confirm the existence of these induced costs (trait-mediated interactions, TMIs); however, the relative importance of intimidation (TMI) and consumption (DMI) effects remains an open question. We conducted a meta-analysis assessing the magnitude of both TMIs and DMIs in predator-prey interactions. On average, the impact of intimidation on prey demographics was at least. as strong as direct consumption (63% and 51% the size of the total predator effect, respectively). This contrast is even more pronounced when we consider the cascading effects of predators on their prey's resources: density effects attenuated through food chains, while TMIs remained strong, rising to 85% of the total predator effect. Predators can thus strongly influence resource density even if they consume few prey items. Finally, intimidation was more important in aquatic than terrestrial ecosystems. Our results suggest that the costs of intimidation, traditionally ignored in predator-prey ecology, may actually be the dominant facet of trophic interactions.

AB Few studies have examined multiple life-history traits across a latitudinal gradient to test whether variation in growth rate and mortality schedules induces trends predicted by life-history theory. We collected data for the following life-history traits for 75 Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) Populations: growth coefficient (K) and asymptotic body length (L-infinity) from the von Bertalanffy growth model, size at ages one and two years, specific juvenile growth rate, instantaneous adult and juvenile mortality rates, life span, age and length at maturity, and reproductive life span and investment. All life-history traits except L-infinity were significantly correlated with latitude. In general, growth rates, mortality rates, and reproductive investment decreased with latitude, whereas age at maturity, size at maturity, and life span increased with latitude. Populations could be grouped into two categories based on variation in L-infinity: stunted (small sized) vs. piscivorous (large sized). Four trait-latitude relationships differed between these two types: the growth coefficient (K) and the juvenile growth rate were larger, and age and length at maturity were lower in the stunted populations compared with piscivorous populations. Perch from southern populations tend to grow fast and experience high juvenile and adult mortality rates. As predicted from life-history theory, this selects for an early age and small size at maturity and relatively large investment in reproduction. The opposite pattern was found for northern populations.

AB Much of the interest in food webs has been driven by a search for universal patterns that could indicate common organizing principles. In an approach that treats food webs as transportation networks (represented by minimum spanning trees) it was recently shown that food webs exhibit universal scaling relations, analogous to those found in river networks and vascular systems. It was concluded that this pattern is due to an optimization process acting in ecological communities. Here we construct minimum spanning trees using Monte Carlo simulations of a simple model that has two parameters that control the proportion of basal species and limit food-chain length, respectively. We show that when the food-chain length is of a similar size to that reported for real food webs, the universal scaling relations readily emerge in the model. This result is robust in a wide range of values for the proportion of basal species. We therefore conclude that the processes that limit food-chain length in ecological communities are sufficient to explain the observed universal scaling relations in food webs, and that complicated adaptive explanations are not required.

ID GRADIENTS; RANGE
AB We compared woody plant species distributions across nested spatial scales (local scale to entire Western Himalaya) and explored landscape scale patterns in detail to obtain inferences about the elevational gradient in species richness. Distribution data were compiled for 1100 species in the Western Himalaya, and primary data, comprising 123 species and 47 000 individuals, were collected for a landscape. Correlates of diversity were examined for the five spatial scales, and for different biogeographic groups at the landscape scale. The results indicate multiple mechanisms both within and across scales. At the landscape scale, though the mechanisms explaining unimodal species richness patterns were hard to separate, the underlying correlates of biogeographic groups were more distinct; temperate species richness followed mid-domain model predictions, and showed a nonlinear relationship with temperature, whereas tropical species richness tracked temperature and area. Simulations demonstrated that models with varying assumptions, while resulting in monotonic, unimodal, or multimodal patterns at local scales, could all lead to unimodal patterns at regional scales when multiple local replicates are aggregated, with a peak in the major ecotone. The turnover or successive accumulation of marginal species in ecotones potentially explains the mid-elevational peak in this zone. Landscape scale primary data on distribution and abundance could therefore be critical to understanding key aspects of macroecological patterns.

AB The identification and understanding of shifts in resource availability and community structure caused by a variety of anthropogenic perturbations is essential to future rehabilitation efforts and recovery of essential ecosystem processes. We focus here on the contribution of nutrient enrichment to the overgrazing of macrophyte-dominated systems, which has often been linked to predator and competition-release of urchins due to overfishing. However, the contribution of nutrient loading to the progression and persistence of this phenomenon should also be considered. In an effort to understand the contribution. of nutrient loading to the overgrazing phenomenon and associated simplified community in a Caribbean, seagrass bed, a detailed isotopic (delta(13)C, delta(15)N) assessment of the food web structure was conducted at both a nutrient-enriched and a control site. The general pattern at the enriched site indicated significantly lighter delta(13)C signatures (i.e., phytoplankton influenced) for non-generalist primary consumers (i.e., specialist grazers, subsurface deposit feeders) and for the sediment organic material (SOM) when compared to the control site. The contribution of phytoplankton and associated particulate organic material to the SOM was also different, 7% vs. 44% at the enriched and control site, respectively. The loss of the autochthonous seagrass detritus pool, in the wake of high densities of generalist urchins (> 66 000 individuals/ha) and low overall consumer diversity, appears to have been partially replaced by opportunistic "alternatives," epiphytes but mainly phytoplankton, that benefit directly from elevated input of anthropogenic, allochthonous nutrients. The availability of such alternative, allochthonous resources to generalist urchins could potentially allow for the persistence of simplified seagrass communities. Here, elevated densities of urchins enable a persistent suppression of autochthonous benthic-macrophyte production through grazing and the consumption of newly recruited competitors and predators.

AB We used 37 years of North American Breeding Bird Surveys to test for effects of periodical cicada (Magicicada spp.) emergences on the abundance and spatial synchrony of 24 species of avian predators in hardwood forests of the eastern United States. Fifteen (63%) of the bird species exhibited numerical changes in abundance apparently associated with emergences of the local periodical cicada brood, and intraspecific spatial synchrony of bird abundance was significantly greater between populations sharing the same cicada brood than between populations in the ranges of different broods. Species exhibited at least four partially overlapping temporal patterns. (I) Cuckoos (Coccyzus spp.) occurred in high numbers only during emergence years and subsequently declined in abundance. (2) Red-bellied Woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus), Blue Jays (Cyanocitta cristata), Common Grackles (Quiscalus quiscula), and Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) increased significantly 1-3 years following emergences and then declined. (3) Red-headed Woodpeckers (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), American Crows (Corvus brachyrynchos), Tufted Titmice (Baeolophus bicolor), Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis), and Brown Thrashers (Toxostoma rufum) were found in significantly low numbers during emergence years, underwent significant numerical increases in the following year, and then stabilized. (4) Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina), Northern Mockingbirds (Mimus polyglottos), Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), and House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) exhibited significantly deviant population numbers 1-2 years prior to emergences, below the long-term mean in the first two species and above the long-term mean in the latter two. These results suggest that the pulses of resources available at 13- or 17-year intervals when periodical cicadas emerge have significant demographic effects on key avian predators, mostly during or immediately after emergences, but in some cases apparently years following emergence events.

AB Marine reserves provide a large-scale manipulation of predator densities, which provides a means to investigate the potential effects of predation. The effects of reef-associated predators were examined in northeastern New Zealand by comparing soft-sediment assemblages at sites having different densities of large predators. Large rock lobsters (Jasus edwardsii) were 3.8 times more abundant, and large snapper (Pagrus auratus) 12 times more abundant, on average, at reserve sites compared with non-reserve sites. The overall structure of infaunal communities differed between areas with high predator densities (reserve) and those with lower densities (fished). Sites with consistently higher densities of snapper and lobster were found to have a lower biomass of two bivalve species, and the greatest decreases were found near the reef edge (2-5 m). For several fauna a strong gradient in their density with distance from the reef was observed at both reserve and nonreserve sites. The hermit crab Pagurus novizelandiae occurred more frequently near the reef edge, while the heart urchin Echinocardium cordatum and bivalve Dosinia subrosea occurred more frequently farther away from the reef. The results suggest that certain species in this assemblage are affected differently by a combination of physical and biological forces. We conclude that, where reef predators are removed by fishing pressure, a resultant indirect effect is an increase in prey species in adjacent soft-sediment assemblages.

AB The study of the ecological factors that govern fighting over resources has been analyzed by resource defense theory and evolutionary hawk-dove games. In essence, the models predict that increasing economic defendability of a resource should lead to increased frequency of aggression among competitors. We question this prediction because it is based on the assumption that individuals that do not possess a resource and must decide whether to attempt aggressive appropriation of another individual's resource face the same economic decision as those that already have possession of a resource and must decide whether to defend against an appropriator's attack. Using an evolutionary game analysis, we explore how changes in group size, clump density, patch richness, and predation hazards affect both the decision to appropriate and defend a resource and interact to predict effects on the frequency of aggression and aggressiveness of individuals. Our model predicts that increasing group size should result in a dome-shaped response of frequency of aggression and a slight decrease in aggressiveness. Increasing clump density is predicted to increase both the frequency of aggression and aggressiveness while increases in clump richness result in reduced aggressiveness at high richness values and a decelerated increase in the frequency of aggression. Finally, predation risk is predicted to increase the frequency of aggression only slightly but to lead to increases in aggressiveness. We compare these predictions to earlier resource defense models. We conclude that most experimental findings agree with our model's predictions but call for explicit experimental tests of our predictions concerning the frequency of aggression and aggressiveness.

AB The decline of corals on tropical reefs is usually ascribed to a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors, but the relative importance of these causes remains unclear. In this paper, we attempt to quantify the contribution of hurricanes to Caribbean coral cover decline over the past two decades using meta-analyses. Our study included published and unpublished data from 286 coral reef sites monitored for variable lengths of time between 1980 and 2001. Of these, 177 sites had experienced hurricane impacts during their period of survey. Across the Caribbean, coral cover is reduced by similar to17%, on average, in the year following a hurricane impact. The magnitude of this immediate loss increases with hurricane intensity and with the time elapsed since the last impact. In the following year, no further loss is discernible, but the decline in cover then resumes on impacted sites at a rate similar to the regional background rate of decline for nonimpacted sites. There is no evidence of recovery to a pre-storm state for at least eight years after impact. Overall, coral cover at sites impacted by a hurricane has declined at a significantly faster rate (6% per annum) than nonimpacted sites (2% per annum), due almost exclusively to higher rates of loss in the year after impact in the 1980s. While hurricanes, through their immediate impacts, appear to have contributed to changing coral cover on many Caribbean reefs in the 1980s, the similar decline in coral cover at impacted and nonimpacted sites in the 1990s suggests that other stressors are now relatively more important in driving the overall pattern of change in coral cover in this region. The overall lack of post-hurricane recovery points to a general impairment of the regeneration potential of Caribbean coral reefs.

AB When environments change stochastically, the question arises how to evaluate the effects of a plant-animal interaction on the fitness of the plant, where plant fitness is measured by the stochastic growth rate. We develop the concept of habitat-stage elasticity, E-beta(S), which gives the proportional sensitivity of the stochastic growth rate to perturbations of stage transition rates in each state (beta) of the habitat. We employ it to understand why a specialist gall-making seed predator has relatively low impact on the fitness of a subtropical shrub. The plant lives in a forest characterized by patchy, recurrent disturbances caused by hurricanes. Both predation rate and plant demography vary with canopy openness. In the most closed-canopy state, the seed predator destroys 90% of the fruits, and demographic quality, the dominant eigenvalue of that state's matrix, is low, while in the most open-canopy state, predation is negligible and demographic quality high. The seed predator is locally extirpated by strong hurricanes, recolonization taking several years.
   The effect of the predator on the stochastic growth rate is negligible at both low and high hurricane frequency. Its effect peaks (6%) at an intermediate hurricane frequency. The stochastic growth rate varies in its sensitivity to the predator in different states of the habitat due to a product of two factors: the frequency of the state in the environment and the contribution of fecundity to its elasticity. The latter factor encapsulates the expected sequence Of future states of the habitat. In our system, the contribution of fecundity to elasticity of the darkest state increases with hurricane frequency, even though the probability of encountering that state decreases, because today's dark habitats are more likely to become lighter ones. The contribution of fecundity to the two lightest states does not vary with hurricane frequency. In contrast, its contribution in intermediate states at intermediate hurricane frequencies is most dynamic, since uncolonized states may become colonized states and insensitive states may become sensitive states. The effects of an animal on plant fitness is determined by the disturbance regime in addition to its impact on vital rates in each environmental state.

AB Carduus nutans (nodding or musk thistle) is an important invasive plant of Eurasian origin. Biological control of this species, using insects that attack rosettes or developing seed heads, has met with varied success in different parts of its invaded range. Here we develop and compare simple demographic matrix models for populations of this species in Australia and New Zealand, to explore reasons for these differences. In a New Zealand population, rapid population growth of C. nutans is driven by early life history transitions. In an Australian population, fecundity of C. nutans is of reduced importance, and survivorship of rosettes plays an increased role. These differences suggest how biocontrol agents that are successful at providing control in one situation may fail in another. Theoretical explorations of the models show which life history transitions drive the differences in matrix elasticities. We suggest that characteristics of the invaded community also play a role in invasion success of this species, and develop theoretical and empirical approaches to assess what factors may drive population growth, and hence what control methods are most likely to work, under different circumstances.

AB Omnivory, defined as feeding on more than one trophic level, was considered rare in nature because of its destabilizing effect. However, recent elaborate studies of natural food webs have shown that omnivory is ubiquitous. It is well known that a simple food chain model of three trophic levels can exhibit chaos if the functional responses are nonlinear. We investigate a three-species Lotka-Volterra model of omnivory in which a predator and a prey share the same resource (i.e., intraguild predation). We demonstrate that intraguild predation sometimes destabilizes food webs and induces chaos, even if the functional responses are linear. The route to chaos is the familiar period-doubling cascade. We compare our results to previous work and discuss the mechanism by which omnivory induces chaos.

AB Adding fluctuations to models of resource competition provides one solution to Hutchinson's paradox. Fundamental to fluctuation dependent mechanisms of coexistence are differential species' responses to environmental fluctuations through time. The covariance between the environment and competition this generates leads to compensatory population dynamics, now thought to be important for community stability. We tested this theory experimentally using freshwater diatoms. We measured the growth of Cyclotella pseudostelligera and Fragilaria crotonensis over a range of temperatures. Cyclotella showed a higher growth rate and higher silicate assimilation rate between 6 degrees C and 18 degrees C, while Fragilaria showed greater competitive ability above 18 degrees C. These results were used to parameterize a resource competition model. Numerical simulation of this model predicted stable coexistence and compensatory dynamics under fluctuating but not constant temperature. A long-term competition experiment with Cyclotella and Fragilaria confirmed the predictions of the model. These results demonstrate the role abiotic fluctuations may play in maintaining the diversity of natural communities.

AB Ecologists are increasingly applying model selection to their data analyses, primarily to compare regression models. Model selection can also be used to compare mechanistic models derived from ecological theory, thereby providing a formal framework for testing the theory. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is the most commonly adopted criterion used to compare models; however, its performance in general is not very well known. The best model according to AIC has the smallest expected Kullback-Leibler (K-L) distance, which is an information-theoretic measure of the difference between a model and the truth. I review the theory behind AIC and demonstrate how it can be used to test ecological theory by considering two example studies of foraging, motivated by simple foraging theory. I present plausible truths for the two studies, and models that can be fit to the foraging data. K-L distances are calculated for simulated studies, which provide an appropriate test of AIC. Results support the use of a commonly adopted rule of thumb for selecting models based on AIC differences. However, AIC(c), a corrected version of AIC commonly used to reduce model selection bias, showed no clear improvement, and model averaging, a technique to reduce model prediction bias, gave mixed results.

AB Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is an abundant but poorly understood pool of N in many ecosystems. We assessed DON cycling in a N-limited headwater forest stream via whole-ecosystem additions of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and labile dissolved organic matter (DOM), hydrologic transport and biogeochemical modeling, and laboratory experiments with native sediments. We sampled surface and subsurface waters to understand how interaction among hydrologic exchange, DIN, DON, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) influence stream N losses at summer baseflow. Added DON was taken up rapidly from the water column at rates exceeding DOC and DIN. A significant fraction of this DON was mineralized and nitrified. Combined DON and NO3-N uptake lengths resulted in spiraling lengths of similar to 210 m, suggesting the potential for multiple. transformations of labile N loads within catchment boundaries. Simultaneous addition of DIN increased DOM uptake, but more so for C, resulting in an upward shift in the C:N ratio of uptake. Sediment incubations also showed a strong biotic influence on DOC and DON dynamics. Despite efficient uptake of added DOM, background DON and high molecular mass DOC concentrations increased downstream, resulting in higher DOM loads than could be accounted for by groundwater discharge and suggesting net release of less bioavailable forms from the channel/hyporheic zone. At the same time, subsurface DOM was characterized by very low C:N ratios and a disproportionately large DON pool despite rapid hydrologic mixing with dilute and high C:N ratio surface waters. Analysis of expected DON loads from conservative hyporheic fluxes indicated that watershed losses of DON would have been seven times greater in the absence of apparent benthic demand, suggesting tight internal cycling of subsurface DON. Our study further demonstrates the potential for significant transformation of N in headwater streams before export to downstream ecosystems.

AB Many ontogenetic niche shifts are phenotypically plastic and with their timing dependent on the perceived risks and benefits for the individual. In fish, hatching can be induced by oxygen shortage or the presence of egg predators or pathogens. However, little is known about the embryos' ability to avoid desiccation by hatching earlier. We simulated an increased risk by exposing some embryonated eggs to low water levels and compared them to control eggs kept deeper in the water. We tested eggs of arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), brown trout (Salmo trutta), and of small and large ecotypes of alpine whitefish (Coregonus sp.). During exposure, the apparently more risky environment induced higher rates of early hatching in all taxa tested. We suggest that the early hatching is either an adaptation of salmonids to risky environments or an accidental by-product that did not get counterselected because of its benefits to the fish larvae.

AB Experimental evidence of trophic cascades initiated by large vertebrate predators is rare in terrestrial ecosystems. A serendipitous natural experiment provided an opportunity to test the trophic cascade hypothesis for wolves (Canis lupus) in Banff National Park, Canada. The first wolf pack recolonized the Bow Valley of Banff National Park in 1986. High human activity partially excluded wolves from one area of the Bow Valley (low-wolf area), whereas wolves made full use of an adjacent area (high-wolf area). We investigated the effects of differential wolf predation between these two areas on elk (Cervus elaphus) population density, adult female survival, and calf recruitment; aspen (Populus tremuloides) recruitment and browse intensity; willow (Salix spp.) production, browsing intensity, and net growth; beaver (Castor canadensis) density; and riparian songbird diversity, evenness, and abundance. We compared effects of recolonizing wolves on these response variables using the log response ratio between the low-wolf and high-wolf treatments. Elk population density diverged over time in the two treatments, such that elk were an order of magnitude more numerous in the low-wolf area compared to the high-wolf area at the end of the study. Annual survival of adult female elk was 62% in the high-wolf area vs. 89% in the low-wolf area. Annual recruitment of calves was 15% in the high-wolf area vs. 27% without wolves. Wolf exclusion decreased aspen recruitment, willow production, and increased willow and aspen browsing intensity. Beaver lodge density was negatively correlated to elk density, and elk herbivory had an indirect negative effect on riparian songbird diversity and abundance. These alternating patterns across trophic levels support the wolf-caused trophic cascade hypothesis. Human activity strongly mediated these cascade effects, through a depressing effect on habitat use by wolves. Thus, conservation strategies based on the trophic importance of large carnivores have increased support in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Mutualisins are inserted in a network of direct and indirect biotic interactions built within the framework imposed by the abiotic setting. We carried out an experiment to test how the availability of light and nutrients modulates the interaction strength between Inga vera (Mimosoideae), a Neotropical extrafloral-nectary-bearing plant, and its associated ants. From July 2001 to July 2003, 48 plants were grown in an old-field site following a three-factor randomized blocked design where treatments were: ant (ants present and absent), nutrient (without and with nutrient addition), and light (sun and shade). During the experiment, in the absence of ants, plants growing in sunlight were shorter, developed fewer leaves and leaflets, were more damaged by herbivores, had half the total dry biomass, and died more frequently than plants visited by ants. In contrast, ants had no effect on the growth, survival, and total biomass of shaded plants. Therefore small-scale heterogeneity in the light environment turned mutualism (+,+) into commensalism (+,0). This study demonstrates experimentally that the outcome of mutualistic interactions can be conditional upon the abiotic setting.

AB Patterns of species co-distribution have often been used to infer the operation of processes such as competition and selection among species. Ecological specialization should create unexpectedly strong species associations, reflected by high positive or negative correlations between species that are adapted to similar or different kinds of site. Two systematic surveys of plant communities do indeed show stronger associations than are expected in randomly assembled communities. Neutral community models, however, also predict nonrandom patterns of co-distribution. Local selection in heterogeneous landscapes, where species are sorted into the sites to which they are best adapted, will produce even stronger associations, provided that different kinds of site are correlated in space, forming repeated combinations or "habitats." In practice, however, this effect is readily detectable only for intense selection in coarse-grained landscapes. In contrast, classification of species or sites into prior categories consistently produces positive associations, and thereby demonstrates the existence of non-neutral processes structuring communities. It is concluded that the bulk properties of communities, such as overall diversity, may be strongly affected by local dispersal and stochastic drift and, for this reason, are adequately represented by neutral models in many cases, despite the operation of systematic processes of local selection. One corollary of this interpretation is that these bulk properties are unlikely to provide useful information about community processes.

AB Do communities return to their former state when we disturb them? The answer is "surely not always," since some disturbances may be so devastating that recovery will be impossible. If communities do recover, then how fast is that recovery? Do different subsets of species return at the same rate? Is that rate a simple exponential recovery-meaning that the change toward the original state is fastest when the community is furthest away and it slows as the community converges? Or is recovery a more dynamically complex process? These questions are theoretically interesting and practically important. The theoretical questions are if there is a particular state-some exact composition-to which a community is likely to return, if there might be several (or many) possible such states, or if community composition is essentially haphazard. The practical implication is that if disturbed ecological communities do not tend to return to a previous state, it may be impossible to undo human impacts on natural ecosystems.
   We follow the fate of species assemblages following the removal of vegetation for mining. We chow that these assemblages in restored subtropical coastal dune forests in South Africa do converge with a regional equilibrium state and that convergence is possible within a reasonable period. However, changes in assemblages from different trophic levels were idiosyncratic: convergence in the dung beetle assemblage did not mimic convergence for trees and birds, for example. Few of the assemblages converged exponentially, the simplest shape for the decay function. Furthermore, trends were sometimes different for different indices of community dissimilarity, suggesting that whether one accepts convergence depends, in part, on exactly what one measures.

AB Relative to the surrounding mainland forests, a subset of tree species dominates wind-exposed, forested islands in Gatun Lake, Panama. We explored how tree diversity in these fragments has been affected by (1) impoverishment of the mammal community and (2) changes in abiotic conditions following island formation ca. 90 years ago. To test effects of changes in the mammal community, we assessed seed and seedling survival for nine tree species in five forests: small islands with no mammals; small islands with spiny rats but no larger mammals; medium islands (intermediate mammal community); Barro Colorado Island (intermittently present puma and jaguar); and mainland forests (intact mammal community). To test effects of abiotic stress, we chose experimental sites at wind-exposed, wind-protected, and interior forest sites. We predicted that fragments with less diverse mammal communities would be characterized by (1) fewer seeds dispersed and cached, (2) lower long-term seed survival, and (3) higher rates of seedling herbivory by mammals. Where alteration of the environment has caused greater exposure to dry-season winds, we predicted that (4) germination and seedling establishment and (5) dry-season seedling survival would be low. Further, we expected that (6) dry-season seedling survival would increase if soil moisture levels were raised, but that (7) wet-season seedling survival is independent of wind exposure.
   In the larger forests, seed and seedling survival were low, and differences in mammal community composition had little effect. Small islands that supported only rats had the same low seed survival as larger forests. Elimination of all mammals resulted in much higher seed survival, and slightly higher seedling survival. Germination and seedling survival were lower at wind-exposed than at protected sites, but irrigation had no effect on dry-season seedling survival. It appears that the dominant species on Gatun Lake fragments have passed through a series of filters: seeds must first avoid being eaten by spiny rats, survive the first dry season, and then avoid seedling herbivory by rats. Biotic and abiotic factors determine seedling survival in tropical forests; synergistic changes in these factors can thus lead to dramatic losses of diversity.

AB Although complex life cycles are widespread, we know little about how constraints in the larval stage influence adult fitness. Most models assume a tight coupling of larval conditions and adult fitness through size and timing of the life history transition. However, there are few empirical tests of this assumption. We combined an experimental manipulation of larval environment with a subsequent study of adult fitness, measured as lifetime mating success. Individuals of the damselfly Lestes viridis were followed from the egg stage to adult reproduction and death. Under time constraints, emergence occurred earlier, but in late-hatched larvae, this did not result in a lower size. Under nutritional constraints, emergence occurred later, and size was reduced. Variation in survival to maturity was better explained by larval constraints than by emergence traits, whereas both larval constraints and emergence traits explained variation in lifetime mating success. Sexes reacted differently to larval constraints, and the coupling of larval constraints to adult fitness also was sex specific. Our results indicate that larval constraints do not necessarily carry over to adult fitness through size and timing of transition, and that carryover effects may be sex specific. This may explain the existence of hidden costs that become visible after maturation and may explain part of the unexplained variation in selection studies on adults.

AB Two major ecological generalizations are that species richness increases monotonically with habitat size and that it is often a unimodal function of primary productivity. We performed a meta-analysis to test hypotheses that, in 41 well-studied lakes of the world, these patterns are an artifact of combining data from pristine and developed lakes. The monotonic species-area relationship was found in lakes in developed watersheds but not in pristine lakes. The richness-productivity relationship was significantly positive linear (not unimodal) for pristine lakes (typically low productivity) and marginally significant negative linear for developed lakes (typically high productivity). The previously reported unimodal relationship appeared only when data from pristine and developed lakes were combined. Watershed development (quadratic model) was the best single descriptor of richness for all lakes and for developed lakes. Our best regression model for all lakes included linear lake area, quadratic productivity, and quadratic development terms. In pristine lakes, species richness was best described by a positive linear function of lake productivity. In developed lakes, richness was best described by positive linear lake area, negative linear productivity, and linear and quadratic development terms. Our results raise the possibility that two fundamental biodiversity relationships in lakes are influenced by land use.

AB Condition-specific competition, wherein competitive superiority varies with the abiotic environment, can determine species' distributions in a spatially heterogeneous environment. We investigated this phenomenon with two competing container-dwelling mosquitoes. We tested the hypothesis that habitat drying alters the outcome of interspecific competition, predicting that the competitive impact of Aedes albopictus on Aedes aegypti would be severe in wetter environments, but greatly reduced in drier environments. We tested these predictions in a laboratory experiment within cages, with aquatic larvae residing in water-filled cups within the cage, and adults emerging within the cage and ovipositing on the cups. We raised each species alone or with the competitor. Environmental treatments were fluctuating (water in cups evaporated to 50% of the original volume and then cups were refilled), and drying (water in cups evaporated completely and cups remained dry for two weeks before refilling). There was a significant interaction between treatment and species combination for adult populations of both species. Interspecific competition was highly asymmetrical. In the wetter fluctuating environment, interspecific competition had a large negative effect on A. aegypti, but in the drying environment, interspecific competition had a large negative effect on A. albopictus, and relatively little impact on A. aegypti. The main cause of the shift in competitive advantage appeared to be a greater increase in egg mortality for A. albopictus under dry conditions, compared to A. aegypti. Thus, mortality impinging on noncompeting life-cycle stages call alter the population level impact of interspecific competition. The hypothesis that dry conditions shift competitive advantage away from A. albopictus is supported in this experiment.

AB We develop a "case model" approach to investigate how conservation measures may affect the ecology of a community module, defined as a small number of tightly interacting species. The community module consists of a parasitic butterfly and its two hosts, a plant and an ant. The butterfly Maculinea alcon and its host plant Gentiana pneumnonanthe have long been used as indicators of high-quality Palearctic heath and moist grassland ecosystems, and both species have been targeted for ecological research and specific conservation management. We constructed a mechanistic model of this community module, including dynamics for the three species, and conducted simulation studies of different conservation strategies (burning, sod cutting, mowing, and grazing). We identified several key parameters for the conservation of Maculinea alcon and its host plant as well as the most efficient conservation strategies for their dual long-term persistence. Our results show that the conditions that optimize the size of the butterfly and the plant populations differ, suggesting that choices must be made in adopting conservation measures. Despite the potential for apparent competition between the ant, Myrmica scabrinodis, and the plant via the butterfly, realized apparent competition is asymmetric (ants are more affected than plants) and occurs only at intermediate successional stages. Our study provides an example whereby an endangered species (the plant) and its endangered specialist natural enemy (the butterfly) are adversely affected by successional dynamics via direct (for the plant) and indirect (for the butterfly) effects. We argue that different field situations will necessitate particular conservation solutions.

AB Few studies have directly assessed how rapidly functionally important insect communities recover following rain forest loss and fragmentation. In 1986, B. Klein compared the dung and carrion beetle assemblages of clearcuts, fragmented, and non-fragmented forests in central Amazonia, reporting drastic short-term changes in community composition. Fifteen years later, we resampled the same sites using identical techniques and found that, with the regrowth of secondary vegetation between forest fragments, the initial differences had largely disappeared. As the secondary vegetation itself supports dung beetle assemblages similar to those of continuous forest, we conclude that, from the perspective of the dung beetles, the experimentally fragmented area had returned to a continuous state within approximately one decade. These results offer some good news for the conservation of tropical ecosystems, since they suggest that conditions favorable for functionally important arthropods may be quickly restored by secondary regrowth. They also suggest that the preservation of forest fragments and secondary vegetation may provide an important complement to the conservation of intact mature forest.

AB Recent research has documented the importance of edaphic factors in determining the habitat associations of tree species in many tropical rain forests, but the underlying mechanisms for edaphic associations are unclear. At Sepilok Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, two main soil types derived from sandstone (ridges) and alluvium (valleys) differ in nutrient and water availability and are characterized by forests differing markedly in species composition, structure, and understory light availability. We use both survey and reciprocal transplants to examine physiological adaptations to differences in light, nutrient, and water availability between these soil types, and test for the importance of resource-use efficiency in determining edaphic specialization. Photosynthetic surveys for congeneric and confamilial pairs (one species per soil type) of edaphic specialists and for generalists common to both soil types show that species specializing on sandstone-derived soil had lower stomatal conductance at a given assimilation rate than those occurring on alluvial soil and also had greater instantaneous and integrated water-use efficiencies. Foliar dark respiration rates per unit photosynthesis were higher for sandstone ridge than alluvial lowland specialists. We suggest that these higher respiration rates are likely due to increases in photosynthetic enzyme concentrations to compensate for lower internal CO2 concentrations resulting from increased stomatal closure. This is supported by lower photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiencies in the sandstone ridge specialists. Generalist species had lower water-use efficiencies than sandstone ridge specialists when growing on the drier, sandy ridgetops, but their nitrogen-use efficiencies did not differ from the species specialized to the more resource-rich alluvial valleys. We varied light environment and soil nutrient availability in a reciprocal transplant experiment involving two specialist species from each soil type. Edaphic specialist species, when grown on the soil type for which they were not specialized, were not capable of acclimatory shifts to achieve similar resource-use efficiencies as species specialized to that soil type. We conclude that divergent water-use strategies are an important mechanism underlying differences in edaphic associations and thus contributing to maintenance of high local tree species diversity in Bornean rain forests.

AB Although spatial patterns of seed distribution are thought to vary greatly among plant species dispersed by different vectors, few studies have directly examined this assumption. We compared patterns of seed rain of nine species of trees disseminated by large birds, monkeys, and wind in a closed canopy forest in Cameroon. We used maximum-likelihood methods to fit seed rain data to four dispersal functions: inverse power, negative exponential, Gaussian, and Student t. We then tested for differences in dispersal characteristics (1) among individuals within species, and (2) among species dispersed by the same vector. In general, an inverse power function best described animal-dispersed species and the Gaussian and Student t functions best described wind-dispersed species. Animal-dispersed species had longer mean dispersal distances than wind-dispersed species, but lower fecundities. In addition to these distinct differences in average dispersal distance and functional form of the seed shadow between animal- and wind-dispersed species, seed shadows varied markedly within species and vector, with conspecifics and species within vector varying in their dispersal scale, fecundity, and clumping parameters. Dispersal vectors determine a significant amount of variation in seed distribution, but much variation remains to be explained. Finally, we demonstrate that most seeds, regardless of vector, fall directly under the parent canopy. Long-distance dispersal events (>60 m) account for a small proportion of the seed crop but may still be important in terms of the absolute numbers of dispersed seeds and effects on population and community dynamics.

AB Ecosystem engineers impact other organisms through environmentally mediated indirect interactions, but the potential for the mechanisms and importance of engineering to vary predictably across environmental gradients has not been investigated. Previously, we investigated how hummock formation by Triglochin maritimum in physically stressful salt marsh pannes influences the plant community that grows only on hummock tops and found that species diversity was dependent on indirect positive effects of T. maritimum engineering. Here we examined how Carex stricta, the tussock sedge, drives superficially similar spatial patterning of plants in relatively benign tidal freshwater marshes at the opposite extreme of an estuarine salinity gradient. In C. stricta marshes, the entire vegetative community is located almost exclusively on top of tussocks while inter-tussock spaces are bare mud buried in C. stricta wrack. We manipulated tussock height, belowground substrate, and aboveground competition for light to investigate the mechanisms by which C. stricta influences the wetland plant community. We also conducted wrack-removal experiments and phytometer assays to examine the importance of wrack deposition in this community and to investigate the spatial distribution of herbivore pressure, respectively. Transplants of four common species performed well in all treatments, except natural intertussock spaces buried in wrack. Removal of wrack from inter-tussock spaces enabled substantial seedling emergence and vegetative cover within one growing season. C. stricta therefore drives plant distribution primarily through indirect negative impacts of wrack accumulation in inter-tussock spaces. Once tussocks are established, plants obtain a secondary benefit when growing on tussocks, as the inter-tussock spaces become runways for small mammalian herbivores that concentrate feeding in low protected areas. These results differ dramatically from nearby salt marshes where T. maritintum facilitates community diversity by alleviating physical stresses. The mechanisms and outcomes of hummock-forming engineers may thus vary predictably across estuarine salinity gradients where hummock formation has facilitative and important impacts in physically stressful environments, but negative and less essential impacts in physically benign environments.

AB Investigating the resilience of fish assemblages requires large-scale experiments, but large-scale manipulations are rarely possible, and "natural experiments" frequently must take their place. Here we report a unique opportunity to explore the resilience of reef fish assemblages. The underground nuclear testing program conducted by the French Armed Forces at Mururoa Atoll, while not intended as an ecological experiment, caused multiple instantaneous removals of fish over areas of approximately 12.5 km(2), without otherwise affecting their environment or the opportunity for recolonization. We show that fish assemblages responded rapidly to these intense; large-scale perturbations, restoring assemblage structure within 1-5 yr. Reef fishery conservation efforts must emphasize protection of habitat, because reef fish assemblages are resilient even to intensive, localized harvesting so long as the structural and biotic integrity of their habitat is maintained and neighboring sites are able to supply recruits.

AB In systems where indirect effects are mediated by traits (e.g., behavior) rather than density, direct and indirect effects may be measured in different biological currencies, making it difficult to quantify their relative contributions to a net interaction. For instance, the hydroid Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus, which colonizes shells occupied by the hermit crab Pagurus longicarpus, affects its host directly by reducing its fecundity and indirectly by modifying the behavior of its predators. In this study, I construct population projection matrices for P. longicarpus, which were housed with different assemblages of hydroids and predators. By defining direct and indirect effects as combinations of log-transformed X's from these matrices, I translate direct effects on fecundity and indirect effects on survival into a common currency (population growth rate), allowing me to assess the relative strength of these effects. In the presence of a fish predator, strong positive indirect effects countered negative direct effects, producing a net mutualism. In the presence of a crab predator, indirect effects were equivalent in size and magnitude to direct effects, resulting in a net parasitism. These results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying context-dependency and help to explain the geographical and temporal variation observed in outcomes of symbiotic interactions.

AB Landscape ecology offers a spatially explicit perspective on the relationships between ecological patterns and processes that can be applied across a range of scales. Concepts derived from landscape ecology now permeate ecological research across most levels of ecological organization and many scales. Landscape ecology developed rapidly after ideas that originated in Europe were introduced to scientists in North America. Key research questions put forth in the early 1980s that catalyzed landscape-level research focused on the formative processes that produce spatial pattern; effects of spatial heterogeneity on the spread of disturbance and fluxes of organisms, material, and energy; and potential applications of landscape ecology in natural resource management. This article describes the development of landscape ecology in North America, discusses current questions and new insights that have emerged, and comments on future directions that are likely to produce new ecological insights. Ecology faces a broad array of challenging questions that require a plurality of approaches and creative insights. Landscape ecology should continue to push the limits of understanding of the reciprocal interactions between spatial patterns and ecological processes and seek opportunities to test the generality of its concepts across systems and scales.

AB Northern peatlands are Substantial sinks of carbon (C), yet the sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from peatlands are largely unknown. Since the relationship between roots and peat in C cycling is important, vascular plants growing on the surface of peat deposits should influence CO2 efflux from the peat surface and the overall C balance in peatlands. In our study, 30-cm peat cores were removed from an ombrotrophic bog in boreal, continental western Canada. Surface vegetation in the cores remained intact and included a continuous bryophyte cover dominated by Sphagnum fuscum. In addition, some cores were collected such that either ericaceous shrubs (Ledum groenlandicum) or sedges (Eriophorum vaginatum) were present. We investigated how the presence of each vegetation type influenced soil respiration and the microbial mineralization of root exudates using a pulse C-14 labeling of vegetation in the intact peat cores. The role of root biomass and toot respiration in CO2 emission and C allocation was quantified for each type of vegetation and compared through both measurement and modeling. Our results show that vascular plants contributed 35-57% of total CO2 efflux from the peat surface, primarily derived from rhizosphere processes, including root respiration as well as microbial mineralization of root exudates. The mineralization of root exudates contributed 14-53 mu mol C-CO(2)(.)m(-2).d(-1) (17-24% of total) to CO2 efflux, depending on vegetation type and moisture conditions. The type of vegetation present did not influence the total amount of photosynthetic fixation over the course of the study, but did affect how C was allocated within and between both the aboveground and belowground components of the peat column.

AB We examined the relative strengths of top-down and bottom-up factors on common herbivores along an experimentally produced environmental-stress gradient in a Florida (USA) salt marsh. We tested whether the effect of parasitoids decreased with increasing environmental stress, and whether the effect of bottom-up factors increased, as advocated by R. W. Preszler and W. J. Boecklen. Proportional increases of foliar nitrogen on fertilized plots were lower on salted plots and so were increases of galls. Such interactions were not significant for sap suckers. Thus, support for the Preszler-Boecklen stress hypothesis via the action of bottom-up effects was mixed. There were also significant changes in enemy-related mortality on salted plots as compared to controls, but again results were mixed. We conclude that P. W. Price's phylogenetic-constraints model, which considers how an organism feeds and oviposits, better predicts how herbivore densities will be changed by environmental stress than the Prezler-Boecklen environmental-stress hypotheses.

AB Marine soft sediments are often considered to be vast, homogeneous expanses of mud or sand; however, most exhibit small-scale biogenic structures. Generally such structures result from short-term processes, but mollusk shell debris can last for centuries, providing a settlement surface for plants and animals, which in turn stabilize the debris. This study sampled patches of shell debris and the surrounding sediment at increasing distances from the patches to determine the role of the patches in driving beta biodiversity. Sampling was conducted at three similar sites within I km in a marine reserve in New Zealand. The shell debris significantly affected beta diversity at all sites, although the magnitude of the effect was dependent on patch size, density, and debris particle size. These results have important implications for estimating and mapping biodiversity. They also have implications for marine conservation. The role of shell debris, suggested by this study, in increasing and maintaining biodiversity, emphasizes a need for reducing disturbance regimes and actively managing seafloor habitats in areas not previously considered for such.

AB The niche variation hypothesis predicts greater morphological variability in populations occupying wide ecological niches than in those occupying narrow ones. Island populations of carnivores are often assumed to have wider niches than mainland populations, because the number of competing species on islands is usually smaller. We compared coefficients of variation and degrees of sexual size dimorphism in skulls and canines of pairs of related insular and mainland populations belonging to 39 carnivore species. Mainland populations were more variable than insular ones. Averaging population values for the different species, we found no significant differences in the variability of insular and mainland taxa. There was no consistent difference in the degree of sexual size dimorphism between insular and mainland carnivores for either skull length or canine diameter. We hypothesize that gene flow is the main source of the greater variability in mainland populations. The niche variation hypothesis is not supported.

AB The time at which a seedling emerges can determine its future success as a plant. Despite the large number of studies that have examined the effect of emergence time on. different components of plant fitness (survival, growth, and/or fecundity), the potential evolutionary response to selection on seedling emergence date is still poorly known. In this study, we review 55 of those studies by a random-effects meta-analysis, considering the phytogenetic relatedness among taxa. We test the following hypotheses: (1) early emergence increases seedling survival, growth, and fecundity, (2) early emergence is more advantageous to large-seeded species than to small-seeded ones, as the former can compensate for the lower number of seeds by increasing seedling survival, (3) perennial plants benefit more than annuals from early emergence, as the iteroparity of the former allows them to risk seedling emergence to the best conditions each year, whereas the semelparity of the latter forces them to spread the risk of emergence over time, and (4) the effect of emergence time may depend upon the experimental conditions (field vs. controlled experiments in a greenhouse or laboratory). Our results show that early emergence differentially affects components of plant fitness, with no effect on seedling survival but large benefits to seedling growth and fecundity. Such effects vary depending upon intrinsic factors like seed size or life-form, and also upon methodology (census time and experimental conditions). Large-seeded species gain from emerging early by growing more during their first growing seasons, although they survive and reproduce similarly to small-seeded species. The survival benefit of early emergence is greater in perennial than in annual species, thus supporting hypothesis 3. The relationship between emergence time and seedling growth appears to be stronger under controlled conditions than in the field, probably as a result of the unlimited nutrient and water resources of the former. In field conditions, in contrast, limited resources probably decelerate the growth of early seedlings, precluding the detection of differences between these and late seedlings.

AB Spruce budworm populations in New Brunswick have been surveyed annually since 1952 by sampling egg masses (later, overwintering larvae) as part of the insecticide application program. Although not designed for an ecological investigation, we extracted as much information from the survey data as we could with respect to several ecological issues. (1) All populations across the province tended to cycle in unison, although three major regions were distinguished by dissimilarity in peak and trough levels. We found that these regional distinctions were a result of random variation in the egg recruitment rate, rather than due to factors associated with comparatively fixed ecoregional (e.g., topographic, climatic, or forest type) characteristics. (2) We found, among all regions, a significant correlation in the rate at which eggs were recruited to each generation, thus providing evidence for the Moran effect as the mechanism underlying population synchrony that caused the province-wide outbreaks. (3) We discuss, with the aid of simulations, the nature and significance of random variations in the egg recruitment rate to explain observed differences in the spatial and temporal patterns of population cycles. Finally, we remark on problems in forecasting.

AB Seed dormancy is assumed to be unimportant for population dynamics of temperate woody species, because seeds occur at low densities and are short lived in forest soils. However, low soil seed densities may result from low seed production, and even modest seed longevity can buffer against fluctuating seed production, potentially limiting density-dependent mortality and ensuring that seeds are available for germination when recruitment success is likely. To investigate whether seed banking affects woody seedling dynamics in the southern Appalachians, we monitored seed rain, seed bank, and seedling densities to (1) determine the prevalence of seed banking among southern Appalachian woody species, (2) quantify annual seed mortality rates for three seed-banking species using a Bayesian statistical approach, and (3) assess whether or not the ability to,seed bank affects recruitment rates. We found that the seeds of eight woody taxa (Acer rubrum, Betula spp., Liriodendron talipifera, Nyssa sylvatica, Robinia pseudoacacia, Rubus spp., Sassafras albidum, and Vitis sp.) remain viable in the soil for more than one year. Seeds of six taxa (Amelanchier spp., Acer pennsylvanicum, Carya spp., Quercus prinus, Quercus rubra, and Tsuga canadensis) were never found in the soil seed bank, despite high seed production and germination. For three species, a substantial proportion of seeds available for germination came from dispersal events two or more years in the past (Acer rubrum 12-37%, Betula spp. 59-73%, Liriodendron tulipifera 40-76%), even though annual seed mortality was high (Acer rubrum 70-98%, Betula spp. 21-81%, Liriodendron tulipifera 12-59%). In years when no seeds fall in local microsites (approximately one in five years), seed banks are the only source of seedling recruitment for these species. Comparing our results to those of previous studies led to valuable insights: first, that seeds of Acer rubrum and Betula spp. suffer high mortality while being incorporated into the seed bank; and second, that seed decay varies greatly over relatively small spatial scales (i.e., within a watershed). Taken together, these results demonstrate that seed banking may play a critical role during woody seedling recruitment in temperate forests.

AB Omnivores have not figured prominently in our understanding of food webs and prey dynamics even though they can have substantial direct and indirect effects on the structure of ecological communities and on the dynamics of interacting species. The important role of omnivores is implicated by the paradoxical results of a food-supplementation experiment. The experiment was designed to test theories that predict how habitat change affects the distribution of habitat-selecting species. According to theories of habitat selection, a quantitative change in habitat (as caused by supplemental food) should increase consumer population size and alter habitat selectivity. Related theories of patch use predict that consumers should increase their use of enriched patches. A two-year experiment on two species of small mammals in Canada's boreal forest failed to alter population densities of red-backed voles, but did cause a dramatic shift in vole habitat use. Rather than increasing their use of feeding stations as predicted by classical theory, voles avoided them. Deer mice did not respond to the experimental treatments. The paradoxical results occurred because omnivorous black bears altered prey behavior by increasing predation risk at feeding stations. Revised theory confirms the indirect omnivore effect, and demonstrates that the behavioral paradox is far more likely for omnivores than for other types of predators. The behavioral paradox of enrichment highlights not only important new, and potentially stabilizing, roles for omnivores, but also the pervasive influences of behavior and habitat selection on population dynamics and regulation.

AB Ecological interactions may vary geographically as a function of diversity, density, or per capita interaction strengths, but we know little about the relative importance of these three mechanisms. We examined variation in species richness, abundance, and interactions among leaf-chewing herbivores and the dominant salt-marsh plant Spartina alterniflora along the Atlantic Coast of the United States. High-latitude S. alterniflora plants are more palatable to herbivores than are low-latitude plants. Within this range of latitude, diversity and density of the dominant leaf-chewing consumers, snails and grasshoppers, in Spartina-dominated portions of the marsh varied little. Low-latitude plants, however, experienced much greater levels of leaf damage from consumers than did high-latitude plants. Per capita feeding rates of low-latitude snails (Littoraria irrorata) and grasshoppers (Orchelimum fidicinum) in the laboratory were greater than feeding rates of high-latitude snails (Melampus bidentatus) and grasshoppers (Conocephalus spartinae). In field experiments, low-latitude snails strongly suppressed S. alterniflora growth, but high-latitude snails had no effect on primary production. Thus, latitudinal differences in the effect of herbivores on plants (i.e., interaction strength), driven by differences in per capita effects among species, rather than differences in diversity or density, may contribute to selection for latitudinal differences in plant palatability. Because geographical differences in interaction strength can occur in the absence of differences in diversity or density, linking biogeography with community ecology will require experimental studies that explicitly measure interaction strength at multiple geographic locations.

AB Using data from a 17-year study of individually marked Blue Petrels, we examined how survival and breeding probability varied with experience and breeding status, and looked for costs of first reproduction, taking into account environmental and individual variability. Using multistate capture-recapture models with four states (inexperienced nonbreeders, first-time breeders, experienced breeders, and experienced nonbreeders). we found that first-time breeders had a lower probability of surviving and breeding in the next year than experienced breeders. Survival of first-time breeders was lower than that of inexperienced nonbreeders, indicating a cost of first reproduction. Survival of inexperienced individuals (both breeders and nonbreeders), but not of experienced ones, was negatively affected by poor environmental oceanographic conditions. The costs of reproduction for first-time breeders were particularly marked during harsh weather conditions. Survival and the probability of breeding in the next year for experienced birds were higher for breeders than for nonbreeders. Similarly, the probability of breeding in the next year for first-time breeders was higher than for inexperienced nonbreeders. This suggests heterogeneity in quality among individuals. Experienced breeders had a higher body condition than first-time breeders and nonbreeders. Body condition did not affect the probability of surviving or breeding in the next year. These results can be interpreted in the light of a change in the proportion of individuals with different survival (selection hypothesis: low-quality individuals die sooner). The inferiority of first-time breeders may be linked to a higher proportion of lower-quality individuals in younger age classes. First reproduction may act as a filter, selecting individuals of higher quality. Sea surface height, reflecting food availability, is probably a key selective agent.

AB Understanding the key ecological factors that moderate the relationship between biodiversity and the productivity of ecosystems is a major challenge for ecological research. Here we show that the relationship between the species richness of primary producers and net rates of biomass production in streams depends on the history of discharge-related disturbances. Using common methods to study 83 streams in the mid-Atlantic United States, we demonstrate that a positive relationship between producer richness and the net production of biomass only occurs in streams characterized by highly variable, unpredictable discharge regimes that represent frequently disturbed environments to benthic organisms. This pattern is partly explained by predictable changes in the composition of species assemblages among disturbed streams. The pattern also results because, in disturbed systems, species have faster rates of biomass accumulation when they are a part of species-rich assemblages. We discuss several possible explanations for this result. Our study supports qualitative predictions from theoretical and small-scale experimental work that the strength of the diversity-productivity relationship will depend explicitly on the disturbance regime of an ecosystem. The results have important implications for the management and conservation of aquatic resources as they suggest that changes to the productivity and diversity of streams may have their greatest impacts on organisms and systems that are most sensitive to disturbance.

AB The analysis of fossil stomata reveals the early postglacial presence of Pinus sylvestris at two sites in the Scottish Highlands, 1600 and 600 years prior to the arrival times indicated by traditional palynological methods. Fossil stomata provide unambiguous evidence of past local presence. for Pinus sylvestris, which produces abundant and widely dispersed pollen, revealing its presence when pine pollen frequencies are as low as 0.4%, considerably below the commonly adopted minimum frequency threshold of 20%. Thus a species may,be present for hundreds to thousands of years before expansion of the local population is registered in the palynological record. This has significant implications, not only for the initial spread of pine throughout the British Isles, but more generally for analyses of the continental-scale migration of temperate and boreal forest taxa based on palynological data. Failure to differentiate effectively among the processes of arrival, establishment, and expansion in analyses of plant migration rates and patterns means that many existing reconstructions of postglacial colonization may, in actuality, represent the expansion of populations over time, rather than the initial spread of species.

AB Recent records of lithodid crabs in deeper waters off the Antarctic continental slope raised the question of the return of crabs to Antarctic waters, following their extinction in the lower Miocene similar to 15 million years ago. Antarctic cooling may be responsible for the impoverishment of the marine high Antarctic decapod fauna, presently comprising only five benthic shrimp species. Effects of polar conditions on marine life, including lowered metabolic rates and short seasonal food availability, are discussed as main evolutionary driving forces shaping Antarctic diversity. In particular, planktotrophic larval stages should, be vulnerable to the mismatch of prolonged development and short periods of food availability, selecting against complex life cycles. We hypothesize that larval lecithotrophy and cold tolerance, as recently observed in Subantarctic lithodids, represent, together with other adaptations in the adults, key features among the life-history adaptations of lithodids, potentially enabling them to conquer polar ecosystems. The return of benthic top predators to high Antarctic waters under conditions of climate change would considerably alter the benthic communities.

AB Because herbivores can move away from plants of low quality, induced resistance should affect the spatial distribution of herbivore damage (or herbivores) within or among plants. We used a spatially explicit simulation model and data from a field experiment to examine the effect of induced resistance on the distribution of herbivores and their damage among plants within a population. The model is appropriate only for rapid (as opposed to delayed) induced resistance, assumes that resistance affects herbivore behavior but not performance, and assumes no interplant communication. It is also appropriate only for induced resistance that decays in the absence of herbivore damage. The simulation tracks herbivores on a linear array of plants or plant parts with reflecting boundaries and allows manipulation of the timing of induced resistance and the initial distribution of herbivores. Our model suggests that increasing tags and thresholds for the production of induced resistance causes increasing aggregation of herbivores and their damage, but in the absence of either a lag or a threshold, induced resistance can lead to an even distribution of herbivores. The formation of even or aggreated distributions of herbivores depends not on initial distributions, but on the characteristics of the induced resistance. In the field experiment, we measured the degree of aggregation of Mexican bean beetle larvae among plants within experimental soybean populations consisting of soybean varieties that had no resistance (low constitutive, low inducible resistance), induced resistance (and low constitutive resistance), or constitutive resistance (and low inducible resistance). In general agreement with qualitative predictions of the model, we found that larvae on soybean varieties with induced resistance remained significantly more aggregated than larvae on varieties with no or high constitutive resistance.

AB The temperature sensitivity of litter decomposition will influence the rates of ecosystem carbon sequestration in a warmer world. A number of studies have shown that the temperature sensitivity of litter decomposition can vary depending on litter type and extent of decomposition. However, the underlying causes of this variation are not well understood. According to fundamental principles of enzyme kinetics, the temperature sensitivity of microbial decomposition should be inversely related to litter carbon quality. We tested the accuracy of this hypothesis by adding ground plant shoot and root material to soils incubated under controlled conditions and measuring the temperature sensitivities of decomposition at three time points throughout a 53-d incubation. As the overall quality of the litter organic C declined, litter decomposition became more sensitive to temperature. This was true regardless of whether differences in C quality were due to inherent differences in litter chemistry or due to differences in the extent of decomposition. The same pattern was observed when specific C compounds of varying quality were added to soil, suggesting that substrate C quality has a significant and predictable influence on the temperature sensitivity of microbial decomposition.

AB While local processes (e.g., competition, predation, and disturbance) presumably cause species exclusion and thus limit diversity in individual communities, regional processes (e.g., historical events, immigration, and speciation) are assumed to provide a source of species to colonize and thus enrich local communities. Ecologists have attempted to distinguish between these two sets of processes using graphical evidence for local assemblage saturation. However, such efforts have been controversial and are antithetical to the fact that local diversity bears an imprint of both. We examine the local-regional species richness relationship from the perspective of the theory of island biogeography and develop a model that can produce the full range of observed local-regional richness relationships from linear to curvilinear. Importantly, unlike previous models, we do not require species interactions to produce the curvilinear pattern. Curvilinear relationships arise if per-species stochastic extinction rates are substantially higher than colonization rates, while linear relationships result if colonization rates are higher than extinction rates. Because we also show that merely changing the sampling scale can make local-regional relationships appear either saturated or unsaturated, an inference of ecological processes, derived solely from local-regional relationships, is unwarranted.

AB Detecting and forecasting the effects of changing climate on natural and exploited populations represent a major challenge to ecologists and resource managers. These efforts are complicated by underlying density-dependent processes and the differential responses of predators and their prey to changing climate. We explored the effects of density-dependence and changing climate on growth of juvenile sockeye salmon and the densities of their zooplankton prey in the Wood River system of southwestern Alaska. We fit dynamic time-series models to data collected between 1962 and 2002 describing growth of juvenile sockeye, timing of spring ice breakup, and summer zooplankton densities. The timing of spring breakup has moved about seven days earlier now than it was in the early 1960s. Our analyses suggest that most of this shift has been a response to the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation that persisted from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s. This progression toward earlier spring breakup dates was associated with warmer summer water temperatures and increased zooplankton (especially Daphnia) densities, which translated into increased sockeye growth during their first year of life. The number of spawning adults that produced each year class of sockeye had a strong negative effect on juvenile sockeye growth rates, so that the size of the density-dependent effect was, on average, twice as large as the effect of spring breakup date. These results highlight the complexity of ecological responses to changing climate and suggest that climate warming may enhance growing conditions for juvenile salmonids in large lakes of Alaska.

AB Body condition can have important fitness consequences, but measuring body condition of live animals from wild populations has been the subject of much recent debate. Using the residuals from a regression of body mass on a linear measure of body size is one of the most common methods of measuring condition and has been used in many vertebrate taxa. Recently, the use of this method has been criticized because assumptions are likely violated. We tested several assumptions regarding the use of this method with body composition and morphometric data from five species of small mammals and with statistical simulations. We tested the assumptions that the relationship between body mass and body size is linear, and that the proportion of mass associated with energy reserves is independent of body size. In addition, we tested whether the residuals from reduced major axis (RMA) regression or major axis (MA) regression performed better than the residuals from ordinary least squares (OLS) regression as indices of body condition. We found no evidence of nonlinear relationships between body mass and body size. Relative energy reserves (fat and lean dry mass) were generally independent or weakly dependent on body size. Residuals from MA and RMA regression consistently explained less variation in body composition than OLS regression. Using statistical simulations, I we compared the effects of violations of the assumption that true condition and residual indices are independent of body size on the OLS, MA, and RMA procedures and found that OLS performed better than the RMA and MA procedures. Despite recent criticisms of residuals from mass-size OLS regressions, these indices of body condition appear to satisfy critical assumptions. Although some caution is warranted when using residuals, especially when both inter-individual variation in body size and measurement error are high, we found no reason to reject OLS residuals as legitimate indices of body condition.

AB Knowing whether, and to what extent, populations are regulated by density-dependent factors is important both in its own right and when developing management strategies for wildlife species. However, available tests for density dependence are typically sensitive to sampling errors in the data. By using a state-space modeling approach, incorporating both an ecological process model and an observation model, it is possible to account for both measurement and process error. Here we focus on the detection and estimation of direct density dependence in two species of North American ducks: the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and the Canvasback (Aythya valisineria). Yearly aerial counts on the major breeding grounds of ducks in North America provide estimates of abundances as well as standard errors of these estimates for both species. Including the number of ponds as a covariate, we demonstrate evidence for density dependence in prairie areas for both species. The appropriateness of the applied state-space method is validated through a simulation study.

AB Dormancy is a condition in which an herbaceous perennial does not sprout for one or more growing seasons. To test whether dormancy is an adaptive response to environmental stress, we defoliated and shaded individuals of two rare geophytic orchids, Cypripedium calceolus and Cephalanthera longifolia, in five Estonian populations early in the growing season in 2002 and 2003. We also censused plants at the same time, and conducted one more census in 2004. Mark-recapture models were used to estimate the probabilities of dormancy (d, the complement to resighting, p), and apparent survival (phi). Apparent survival varied little by treatment, with Cypripedium and Cephalanthera surviving at 0.986 +/- 0.014 and 0.974 +/- 0.021 (mean +/- SE), respectively. In contrast, treatment impacted dormancy dramatically. For both Cephalanthera and Cypripedium, defoliated (def.) plants were most dormant (0.320 +/- 0.055 and 0.095 +/- 0.036, respectively). However, while both control (cont.) and shaded (sh.) plants were roughly equally least dormant in Cypripedium (d(cont) = 0.048 +/- 0.020 vs. d(sh) = 0.045 +/- 0.021), the least dormant Cephalanthera had been shaded (0.182 +/- 0.040 vs. d(cont.) = 0.206 +/- 0.050). We conclude that dormancy may allow the plant to buffer stress in the short term without increasing mortality risk.

AB The onshore deposition of macroalgal and macrophyte wrack provides a potentially significant marine subsidy to intertidal and supratidal herbivore and decomposer communities. Based on the study of daily input loads to beaches, we estimated summer wrack deposition of up to 140 Mg (dry mass)/km shoreline in Barkley Sound, British Columbia. However, input rates were highly variable depending on beach type, nearshore hydrodynamics, and buoyancy characteristics of the wrack. Cobble beaches retained similar to 10 times and 30 times more wrack than did gravel and sand beaches, respectively. Cobble and gravel beaches also differed in species composition of new (fresh) wrack input, with Macrocystis integr folia being characteristic for the former and Nereocystis luetkeana for the latter, which we attribute to buoyancy characteristics of the floating debris. On sand beaches, Phyllospadix spp. and Enteromorpha spp. were the dominant wrack species. Species composition of freshly deposited wrack also depended on wave exposure, but predictability based on the species pool within a beach's catchment was restricted. Drift lines of aging wrack differed from freshly deposited wrack in species composition, probably due to wrack decomposition that results in fluxes of nutrients and energy between the adjacent marine and terrestrial habitats. We hold that the characteristics of a given beach, e.g., substratum and wave exposure, and their effects on wrack input, will have important ecological and biogeochemical implications for the marine-terrestrial ecotone.

AB Spatially density-dependent predation is a leading hypothesis describing mechanisms of population regulation in coral reef fish. However, studies supporting this hypothesis predominantly have been conducted on small, isolated patch reefs. Here, we searched for evidence of spatially density-dependent predation on the continuous reefs of the Netherlands Antilles in a study of a dominant planktivore, the blue chromis (Chromis cyanea). Across space, we quantified both the patterns of loss from site-attached aggregations of C. cyanea through time and the behavioral reaction of predators to these aggregations. Looking across C. cyanea densities, we found that loss from aggregations was not characteristic of direct density dependence, but instead was commonly inversely related to density. Individual C. cyanea in larger aggregations were less likely to be lost from the group than were individuals in smaller aggregations. Thus, the observed density dependence increased spatial heterogeneity of C. cyanea. Predators showed behaviors that were consistent with these demographic patterns. Using remote videography, we quantified predator visitation and strike rates across a range of C. cyanea aggregation sizes. Predators consistently visited and struck at individuals in C. cyanea aggregations in a pattern that was strongly inversely density dependent, suggesting that aggregation is an effective means of minimizing per capita risk of predation for prey reef fish. Differences in spatial distribution of resources for predators (i.e., prey fish) between continuous and patch reef habitats may explain the difference between these results and those of previous studies on patch reefs.

AB Understanding the effects of landscape structure on the distribution of organisms in subdivided habitat is central to spatial ecology and conservation biology. We investigated how suitable habitat patches and the intervening matrix influenced the incidence and abundance of cactus bugs (Chelinidea vittiger) on their naturally patchy host plant, plains prickly pear (Optintia polyacantha). We compared responses of three life stages of C. vittiger on two landscapes with different matrix properties in Colorado, USA. Patch area and abundances of C. vittiger exhibited a limiting-factor relationship that we estimated with quantile regression. Chelinidea vittiger density in patches was negatively related to patch area for all life stages and landscapes, Our results supported predictions from the "undermatching hypothesis," which suggests that limited knowledge of resource patches is one determinant of abundance patterns. Multiple regression models of occupancy and abundance indicated that (I) the amount of explained variance depended greatly on the measured response variable and on the life stage of the insect, (2) metrics of patch connectivity had more support in models of abundance than of presence-absence in patches, (3) patch area had an interactive effect with patch connectivity in most abundance models, and (4) a "matrix-matters" measure of connectivity received only mixed support when included in abundance models for a landscape with a heterogeneous matrix. A model that included only the two priority variables in basic metapopulation models (patch area and patch connectivity) was insufficient for understanding distribution patterns of C. vittiger in patchy landscapes.

AB Annual spring burning of tallgrass prairie increases plant biomass production despite losses of N and lower net N mineralization. To better understand how burning influences the cycling of N in prairie, N-15 was injected to soil as NH4+, and the partitioning between plant and soil N pools was followed over five growing seasons in annually burned and unburned prairie. Applied N-15 was rapidly immobilized with < 2% and 11% of the N-15 remaining in inorganic forms six days after application in burned and unburned prairie, respectively. Seventy-seven percent (burned prairie) and 70% (unburned prairie) of the applied N-15 was initially recovered as soil organic N (oN), with a majority accounted for in microbial biomass. Plants contained similar to 20% of the applied N with the largest portion recovered from roots regardless of burning. At the end of the first growing season, only 55% of the applied N-15 was recovered from the unburned prairie, while 85% was recovered from burned prairie. The total N-15 content of the plants changed little during the first growing season, but the portion recovered in the rhizomes increased, indicating belowground N storage. Total recovery and distribution of applied N changed little from the end of the first to the end of the second season growing season. Accumulations of N-15 within the plants decreased greatly between the second and fifth growing seasons, but N lost from plants was accounted for in oN. Conservation of N by plants and tight cycling of N within. the root zone suggest mechanisms by which prairie can be a highly productive ecosystem despite limited N availability. The immobilization of potentially mineralized N within the root zone increased with burning, offsetting the loss of N to fire probably by reducing leaching and denitrification losses.

AB To study genetic effects of habitat fragmentation on plant performance and plant response to biotic interactions, we performed a greenhouse study with plants from 27 populations of the common plant Lychnis flos-cuculi differing in size, isolation, and microsatellite heterozygosity. We germinated seeds of 449 plants and grew up to nine offspring per maternal plant in single pots assigned to a factorial competition-by-pathogen infection treatment. We applied competition by sowing seeds of the grass Anthoxanthunt odoratum into half of the pots. Moreover, half of the plants were inoculated with infective sporidia of the anther smut Microbotryum violaceum. Significant variation among populations in most size measures indicated genetic differentiation between populations. Plants from smaller populations developed fewer flowers than plants from larger populations indicating a genetic Allee effect. A decrease in flower number was also observed for populations with decreased microsatellite heterozygosity, suggesting higher inbreeding depression. Competition and pathogen infection reduced plant size independently from one another and independent from the fragmentation of the habitats of plant origin. While pathogen infection increased the total number of flowers per plant, it decreased the number of uninfected flowers per plant. This study demonstrates that even common species are negatively affected by habitat fragmentation. At the same time, it suggests little effect of habitat fragmentation on plant response to experimental competition and pathogen infection.

AB We identify changes in the pelagic fish community of the tropical Pacific Ocean by comparing recent data collected by observers on longline fishing vessels with data from a 1950s scientific survey when industrial fishing commenced. A major shift in size composition and indices of species abundance and community biomass accompanied the start of fishing. The largest and most abundant predators, such as sharks and large tunas, suffered the declines in abundance (2 1 % on average). They also showed striking reductions in mean body mass. For example, the mean mass of blue shark (Prionace glauca) was 52 kg in the 1950s compared to 22 kg in the 1990s. The estimated abundance of this species was 13% of that in the 1950s. Overall, the biomass of large predators fell by a factor of 10 between the periods. By contrast, several small and formerly rare species increased in abundance, e.g., pelagic stingray (Dasyatis violacea). However, the increases in small species did not balance the reductions in the biomass of large predators. Of three possible explanations (fishing, environmental variation, and sampling bias), available evidence indicates fishing to be the most likely cause for the observed patterns.

AB Sympatric plant species with similar flowering phenologies and floral morphologies may compete for pollination, and as a consequence potentially influence each other's reproductive success and mating system. Two likely competitors are Mimulus ringens and Lobelia siphilitica, which co-occur in wet meadows of central and eastern North America, produce blue zygomorphic flowers, and share several species of bumble bee pollinators. To test for effects of competition for pollination, we planted experimental arrays of Mimulus ringens, each consisting of genets with unique combinations of homozygous marker genotypes. In two arrays we planted mixtures of Mimulus and Lobelia. and in two additional arrays we planted Mimulus without a competitor for pollination. Bumble bee pollinators frequently moved between Mimulus and Lobelia flowers in the mixed-species arrays, with 42% of plant-to-plant movements being interspecific transitions. Pollinator movements between species were associated with a reduction in the amount of conspecific pollen arriving on Mimulus stigmas. The presence of Lobelia led to a significant 37% reduction in the mean number of Mimulus seeds per fruit. In addition, Mimulus had a significantly lower rate of outcrossing in the mixed-species arrays (0.43) than in the "pure" arrays (0.63). This is the first study to demonstrate that competition for pollination directly influences outcrossing rates. Our work suggests that in self-compatible populations with genetic load, competition for pollination may not only reduce seed quantity, but may also lower seed quality.

AB Evidence from numerous studies suggests that species richness is an emergent property of local communities. The maintenance of species richness, despite changes in species composition and environmental conditions, requires compensatory colonization and extinction events with species coming from a regional pool. Using long-term data from a rodent community in the Chihuahuan Desert, we use randomization methods to. test the null hypothesis that changes in species richness occur randomly. We find that the dynamics of species richness differ significantly from a random process, and that these nonrandom dynamics occur largely within the most speciose guild. Finally, we propose a general framework for assessing the importance of species compensation in maintaining biodiversity within local communities. Our results highlight the importance of niche complementarity and compensation in maintaining relatively constant species richness over time.

AB Quaking aspen (Populas tremuloides Michx.) is a long-lived clonal species in which many genetically identical stems (ramets) arise from a common root system. Establishment by seed is extremely rare in the Rocky Mountain region, where most clones that exist today are thought to have established hundreds or thousands of years ago. However, recruitment of new genetic individuals through sexual reproduction has occurred periodically throughout the Holocene, and widespread establishment of seedling aspen occurred in Yellowstone National Park, USA, following the extensive 1988 fires. We combined extensive survey methods with manipulative experiments to investigate the patterns and mechanisms of new aspen genet establishment, growth, and survival during their first decade of development. Excavation and aging of 171 aspen stems in 1996 demonstrated that 65% had established within the first three years after the 1988 fires, and that none predated 1988. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) genetic analyses revealed that 92% of the plants were genetically distinct individuals, and 8% were ramets. Annual surveys of 22 permanently marked aspen seedling plots revealed that 24% of 417 seedlings tallied in 1996 had died by 2000. However, mortality varied greatly among the 22 plots, from < 10% to > 40%, with greater mortality at lower elevations and where soil organic matter was low. To evaluate the mechanisms underlying seedling persistence or mortality, we constructed exclosures in three sites to protect aspen seedlings from ungulate browsing, and applied four experimental treatments from 1996 to 1998: (1) clipping of current year's growth to simulate browsing, (2) removal of potential competitors including lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) saplings and herbaceous plants, (3) clipping and competitor removal, and (4) control, i.e., no treatment except protection from browsing. Clipping prevented stem elongation, but removing competitors had no significant effect on height growth of aspen seedlings. Even with protection from browsing, most aspen stems grew slowly (mean increment < 25 cm from 1996 to 2000), and many died from causes unrelated to herbivory. Nevertheless, some individuals were > 2 m tall in 2003 and appeared vigorous. The aspen cohort that germinated after the 1988 fires appears to be in the earliest stage of a long-term population process, a process that likely will entail a shift from many genetically distinct individuals but few ramets, to relatively few genets having numerous ramets. We predict that many or most of the post-1988 aspen seedlings will die within the next few decades, with little lasting effect on broad-scale vegetation patterns or postfire successional trajectories. However, some new genets appear likely to survive and to establish new aspen clones, with potentially important consequences for demographic and genetic structure of the Yellowstone aspen population.

AB The importance of spatial and temporal autocorrelation for the processes occurring at many different scales has been pointed out in the last few years. Although the role of spatial pattern in models on metapopulation dynamics has recently been recognized, there is a lack of empirical studies accounting for the consequences of considering autocorrelation in these processes. Here, we show that the conventional statistical methods used for determining the factors controlling species population dynamics (species density, sex ratio, and extinction events) can be strongly affected by spatial autocorrelation. Under these circumstances, the use of a spatially explicit model is highly recommended in order to demonstrate the real factor controlling species population dynamics. Moreover, presenting erroneous conclusions concerning the real factors governing species population dynamics could have far-reaching consequences in the management and conservation of many endangered species.

AB We used a combination of field studies and laboratory experiments to characterize key ecological aspects of the seed biology and soil seed bank dynamics of annual plant communities in chenopod shrublands of South Australia. A sequential study of the soil seed bank demonstrated seasonal and between-year variability in numbers and composition of the soil seed bank. Soil samples incubated under different temperature and watering regimes produced different communities, indicating that species respond differentially to various environmental combinations. Emergence was extremely low at low water availability and at high temperatures, even in trays with ample water. A high percentage of seeds of four out of five species buried in the field remained viable for two years, while the fifth, Carrichtera annua, showed a sharp decline in seed viability, reaching nearly zero survivorship. Our results indicate that, in this system, annual plant communities result from germination of a fraction of seeds present in the soil seed bank, when autumn or winter rainfalls occur. Because different species have different responses to various combinations of environmental conditions, the community composition varies from year to year. This variability is likely to be a component of coexistence through the storage effect.

AB Understanding population dynamics requires models that admit the complexity of natural populations and the data ecologists obtain from them. Populations possess structure, which may be defined as "fixed" stages through which individuals pass, with superimposed variability among individuals and groups. Data contain missing values and inaccurate censuses. From limited data ecologists attempt to predict life history schedules and population growth.
   We extend the "missing value" framework for Bayesian analysis of structured populations to admit the heterogeneity in demography and the limitations of data that are typical of ecological populations. Our hierarchical treatment of capture-recapture data allows inference on demographic rates contained in matrix transition models for populations that may be stratified by location and by other variables. Simulations with artificial data sets demonstrate the ability of the Bayesian model to Successfully estimate underlying parameters, even with incomplete census data. In contrast, traditional nonhierarchical models may lead to biased parameter estimates because of variation in recapture rates of individuals. Analyses of published demographic data on Common Terns and Taitu Hills rats illustrate the utility of the model. Predictive distributions of maturation age, survivorship, and population growth demonstrate profound impacts of population and data complexity.

AB This study aimed at unraveling the structure underlying the taxon-richness matrix of shallow lakes. We assessed taxon richness of a large variety of food-web components at different trophic levels (bacteria, ciliates, phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish, macro-invertebrates, and water plants) in 98 shallow lakes from three European geographic regions: Denmark (DK), Belgium/The Netherlands (BNL), and southern Spain (SP). Lakes were selected along four mutually independent gradients of total phosphorus (TP), vegetation cover (SUBMCOV), lake area (AREA), and connectedness (CONN). Principal-components analysis (PCA) indicated that taxon diversity at the ecosystem level is a multidimensional phenomenon. Different PCA axes showed associations with richness in different subsets of organism groups, and differences between eigenvalues were low. Redundancy analysis showed a unique significant contribution to total richness variation of SUBMCOV in all three regions, of TP in DK and SP, and of AREA in DK and BNL. In DK, several organism groups tended to show curvilinear responses to TP, but only one was significantly hump shaped. We postulate that the unimodal richness responses to TP that are frequently reported in the literature for many organism groups may be partly mediated by the unimodal response of macrophyte vegetation to. lake productivity.

AB We used the mast-seeding tree Picea glauca (white spruce) to examine whether the timing of mast years relative to fire had a lasting effect on the density and timing of regeneration. We studied 17 fires that occurred in mast years and in years with low cone production between 1941 and 1994. Trees were carefully aged by crossdating procedures. Over the 59-yr period studied, there was significantly more regeneration after fires that occurred in mast years than after fires that occurred in years of low cone production. Spruce density was significantly lower after fires that occurred 1-3 years before a mast year than after fires during mast years. The cohort of trees that regenerated in the first mast year after a fire was critical to white spruce regeneration for fires that occurred 0-1 year before a mast year, but mast years occurring three or more years after a fire contributed few recruits. Our results suggest that masting is a key process that interacts with fire to shape stand composition in boreal mixedwoods. For species like white spruce, for which establishment is linked to disturbance, masting may have a contingent, historical effect on succession and landscape structure.

AB Movements and behavior of animals can result in transfer of nutrients between discrete spatial patches, leading to spatial and temporal variability in resource sheds, modification of nutrient cycling, changes in productivity and in community structure and function, and increases in landscape heterogeneity. In this study, we explored the function of scent-marking at latrines by coastal river otters (Lontra canadensis), through investigating spatial distributions of otters with respect to gender, sociality, and the distribution of their food resources. We then calculated the amounts of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) transported to latrine sites based on otter foraging behavior and the function of scent-marking at latrines. Locations of 55 radio-tagged otters in Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA, were obtained through aerial telemetry over a period of four years. Data on fish densities and marine habitat features were concurrently obtained from scuba transects and aerial surveys. A plastic social organization in river otters resulted in different foraging strategies and scent-marking behaviors. Social otters were more closely associated with schooling fishes and used latrines for intra-group communication,, whereas nonsocial otters, which concentrated on intertidal and subtidal fishes, probably signaled mutual avoidance. In contrast, females appeared to use latrines for the defense of territories. Social otters used fewer sites with greater intensity, whereas nonsocial otters used more sites with lower intensity. These different functions of scent-marking and associated behaviors of otters resulted in high variability in nutrient inputs to different latrine sites. Although some sites may receive 2.7 g N(.)m(-2.)yr(-1) and 0.4 g P(.)m(-2.)yr(-1), others may be fertilized with up to 47.6 g N(.)m(-2.)yr(-1) and 6.7 g P(.)m(-2.)yr(-1). This spatial variability and the temporal changes in resource sheds is likely to result in the creation of heterogeneous landscape at the land margin.

AB The balance between tree competition and facilitation may shift in relation to gradients in soil resource supplies, thereby determining patterns in overall stand-level production and community structure. We tested for variation in the nature and intensity of interactions between Eucalyptus saligna and nitrogen-fixing Falcataria mollucana along a gradient of soil nitrogen and phosphorus supply in Hawaii, USA. Neighborhood indexes were used to describe competitive and facilitative interactions between trees, and spatially explicit models of individual tree growth and survival were developed to look at the effects of soil nutrient supply on those interactions. The dynamics between neighboring trees depended strongly on soil nutrient supply. Large trees generally grew faster than smaller trees, but this pattern was moderated by interactions between nutrient availability and the intensity of competition and facilitation. Falcataria survival decreased by Lip to 30% with increasing Eucalyptus on low-nitrogen soils, but increased by nearly 70% on soils with higher nitrogen levels. Intraspecific interactions reduced Falcataria growth by up to 100% on high-phosphorus soils, yet facilitated the growth of focal trees growing on low-phosphorus soils by up to 60%. The effect of Falcataria neighbors on Eucalyptus growth also depended on phosphorus supply: increased Falcataria reduced predicted growth of the focal tree by 2017() on low-phosphorus soils, but increased growth by 8% on high-phosphorus soils. Relationships between species were more dynamic at the scale of individual trees than previously indicated by stand-level assessments. The important role of soil nutrient supply in moderating both the intensity and nature of tree interactions implies that competition and facilitation studies need to consider a wide range of soil conditions to be generalizable.

AB Exploitation theory predicts strongest plant-herbivore interactions at sites of intermediate productivity. Recent studies illustrate the importance of top-down effects by small to intermediate-sized herbivores in structuring salt-marsh communities. How long-term effects of herbivory are modified by productivity of the system is a largely unexplored area. We studied how herbivory by geese and hares affected plant species replacement by erecting exclosures along a natural productivity gradient in a temperate salt-marsh system. After seven years, the largest shifts in species composition were observed when both hares and geese were excluded from plots. Only excluding geese did not have a large impact on species replacement, indicating that geese alone did not control the vegetation. Herbivory slowed down succession by retarding the establishment and spread of late-successional species on the low salt marsh. Effects of herbivory were less clear on the high marsh. Vegetation change after excluding herbivores was most pronounced in the most unproductive regions of the salt marsh. As a result, different successional trajectories emerged when herbivores were absent or present at the onset of salt-marsh succession. At sites of intermediate productivity, where grazing pressure was highest, no effect of herbivory on species composition was found. We hypothesize that the high dominance of grazing tolerant species at these sites retarded the invasion of late-successional species. The intensity of herbivory did not accurately predict the importance of herbivory in structuring plant communities. To understand herbivore effects along productivity gradients, the selectivity patterns of the herbivores and the bottom-up effects of plants on these interactions need to be considered.

AB Many empirical studies have quantified gene dispersal in plants. Theoretical principles are required to explain these observations and to predict gene dispersal in new situations. The "portion-dilution" model (PDM) is a parametric restatement of the conventional view of animal pollination that predicts levels of pollinator-mediated gene dispersal. The present study tested the PDM's ability to predict gene dispersal in rows of bumble bee-pollinated Brassica napus containing centrally located, genetically marked plants. The PDM accurately predicted the proportion of marked progeny among unmarked plants (predicted = 2.0%, observed = 2.1%), and a related analysis explained 74% of the spatial variation in marker gene representation. This theory's success begins to validate its use for predicting gene dispersal in B. napus in particular and for explaining pollinator-mediated gene dispersal in general.

AB Few invaded ecosystems are free from habitat loss and disturbance, leading to uncertainty whether dominant invasive species are driving community change or are passengers along for the environmental ride. The "driver" model predicts that invaded communities are highly interactive, with subordinate native species being limited or excluded by competition from the exotic dominants. The "passenger" model predicts that invaded communities are primarily structured by noninteractive factors (environmental change, dispersal limitation) that are less constraining on the exotics, which thus dominate. We tested these alternative hypotheses in an invaded, fragmented, and fire-suppressed oak savanna. We examined the impact of two invasive dominant perennial grasses on community structure using a reduction (mowing of aboveground biomass) and removal (weeding of above- and belowground biomass) experiment conducted at different seasons and soil depths. We examined the relative importance of competition vs. dispersal limitation with experimental seed additions. Competition by the dominants limits the abundance and reproduction of many native and exotic species based on their increased performance with removals and mowing. The treatments resulted in increased light availability and bare soil; soil moisture and N were unaffected. Although competition was limiting for some, 36 of 79 species did not respond to the treatments or declined in the absence of grass cover. Seed additions revealed that some subordinates are dispersal limited; competition alone was insufficient to explain their rarity even though it does exacerbate dispersal inefficiencies by lowering reproduction. While the net effects of the dominants were negative, their presence restricted woody plants, facilitated seedling survival with moderate disturbance (i.e., treatments applied in the fall), or was not the primary limiting factor for the occurrence of some species. Finally, the species most functionally distinct from the dominants (forbs, woody plants) responded most significantly to the treatments. This suggests that relative abundance is determined more by trade-offs relating to environmental conditions (long-term fire suppression) than to traits relating to resource capture (which should most impact functionally similar species). This points toward the passenger model as the underlying cause of exotic dominance, although their combined effects (suppressive and facilitative) on community structure are substantial.

AB Soil nitrogen and phosphorus pools shift strongly along soil chronosequences worldwide, but variation in plant nutrient resorption along these sequences is poorly understood. We quantified leaf and litter nutrient concentrations in 28 woody species along the Franz Josef soil chronosequence, New Zealand, a strong fertility gradient in temperate rain forest, to address two questions: How do leaf and litter nutrient concentrations vary along a soil chronosequence? And are the community-level responses driven by compositional differences among fertile and infertile sites, or by consistent changes in resorption proficiency within growth forms, and within species? Community-level leaf and litter N and P concentrations declined by between 67% and 88% along the soil chronosequence, and these responses were remarkably consistent within three contrasting growth forms (angiosperms, conifers, tree ferns), and within individual species. In spite of the three growth forms sharing similar responses to the soil chronosequence, tree ferns had higher absolute concentrations of leaf N, leaf P, and litter N relative to angiosperms, and higher concentrations of leaf N relative to conifers. These results clearly indicate that differences among fertile and infertile sites are driven both by compositional differences, as has been previously demonstrated, and by plasticity of individual species.

AB Models and observational studies have sought patterns of predictability for invasion of natural areas by nonindigenous species, but with limited success. In a field experiment using forest understory plants, we jointly manipulated three hypothesized determinants of biological invasion outcome: resident diversity, physical disturbance and abiotic conditions, and propagule pressure. The foremost constraints on net habitat invasibility were the number of propagules that arrived at a site and naturally varying resident plant density. The physical environment (flooding regime) and the number of established resident species had negligible impact on habitat invasibility as compared to propagule pressure, despite manipulations that forced a significant reduction in resident richness, and a gradient in flooding from no flooding to annual flooding. This is the first experimental study to demonstrate the primacy of propagule pressure as a determinant of habitat invasibility in comparison with other candidate controlling factors.

AB The nectar of many plant species contains defensive compounds that have been hypothesized to benefit plants through a variety of mechanisms. However, the relationship between nectar defenses and plant fitness has not been established for any species. We experimentally manipulated gelsemine, the principal alkaloid of Carolina jessamine (Gelsemium sempervirens), in nectar to determine its effect on pollinator visitation, nectar robber visitation, and male and female plant reproduction. We found that nectar robbers and most pollinators probed fewer flowers and spent less time per flower on plants with high compared to low nectar alkaloids. High alkaloids decreased the donation of fluorescent dye, an analogue of pollen used to estimate male plant reproduction, to neighboring plants by one-third to one-half. However, nectar alkaloids did not affect female plant reproduction, measured as pollen receipt, fruit set, seed set, and seed mass. The weak effects of nectar alkaloids on female reproduction could represent a balance between the altered behavior of nectar robbers and pollinators, or it could be that neither of these interactions affected plant reproduction. Taken together, these results suggest that secondary compounds in nectar may have more costs than benefits for plants.

AB Environmental degradation is reducing the variability of living assemblages at multiple spatial scales, but there is no a priori reason to expect biotic homogenization to occur uniformly across scales. This paper explores the scale-dependent effects of recent perturbations on the biotic variability of lagoonal reefs in Panama and Belize. We used new, and previously published core data to compare temporal patterns of species dominance between depth zones and between geographic locations. After millennia of monotypic dominance, depth zonation emerged for different reasons in the two reef systems, increasing the between-habitat component of beta diversity in both taxonomic and functional terms. The increase in between-habitat diversity caused a decline in geographic-scale variability as the two systems converged on a single, historically novel pattern of depth zonation.
   Twenty-four reef cores were extracted at water depths above 2 in in Bahia Almirante, a coastal lagoon in northwestern Panama. The cores showed that finger corals of the genus Porites dominated for the last 2000-3000 yr. Porites remained dominant as the shallowest portions of the reefs grew to within 0.25 in of present sea level. At intermediate depths of 5-10 m, however, declining water quality in the Bahia enabled the lettuce coral Agaricia tenuifolia to replace Porites during the last several decades. In Belize, the staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis dominated the rhomboid shoals of the central shelf lagoon for millennia. As the shallowest portions of the rhomboid shoals approached sea level around 500 years ago, Porites spp. replaced Ac. cervicornis in an intrinsically driven successional sequence. At intermediate depths, white-band disease killed Ac. cervicornis in the late 1980s, precipitating a transition to dominance by Ag. tenuifolia. Phase shifts between coral taxa and the emergence of coral zonation in both locations were mediated by the sea urchin Echinometra viridis, which controlled algal growth. Opposite trends in biotic variability at the habitat and geographic levels highlight the complex, scale-deperident nature of the response of coral reefs to intense perturbations.

AB Predictable relationships among patterns, processes, and properties of plant communities are crucial for developing meaningful conceptual models in community ecology. We studied such relationships in 18 plant communities spread throughout nine Northern Hemisphere high-mountain subalpine and alpine meadow systems and found linear and curvilinear correlative links among temperature, precipitation, productivity, plant interactions, spatial pattern, and richness. We found that sites with comparatively mild climates have greater plant biomass, and at these sites strong competition corresponds with overdispersed distribution of plants, reducing intraspecific patchiness and in turn increasing local richness. Sites with cold climates have little biomass, and at these sites a high proportion of species benefit from strong facilitative effects of neighbors, leading to an aggregated distribution of plants. Sites with intermediate, or relatively moderate climates are intermediate in biomass, and at these sites interactions are weak (or competition may be counterbalanced by facilitation), corresponding with a nearly random distribution of plants. At these sites species richness is lower than average. We propose that the relationship between interspecific spatial pattern and community richness reflects niche differentiation and/or construction, which allows for the coexistence of more species than would be possible with random, unstructured spatial distributions. Discovering the mechanisms that drive the relationships described here would further link functional and structural components of plant communities and enhance the predictive capability of community ecology.

AB Invasive species have the potential to alter trade-offs leading to selection in the populations they invade. Here we quantify the demographic and selective effects of herbivory by native insects and the introduced floral feeder Rhinocyllus conicus on Platte thistle (Cirsium canescens), a sparse monocarpic thistle endemic to North America. Rhinocyllus first invaded the Platte thistle population in 1993. Since then, its numbers have increased exponentially, while the Platte thistle population size has decreased. Data from 11 years were analyzed to determine how demographic rates varied with plant size and damage by native insects and Rhinocyllus. Individual growth, survival, flowering probability, and seed set were all size dependent. Damage to vegetative structures did not influence demographic rates; damage to flower heads did because Platte thistle is seed limited. These analyses were used to parameterize a series of integral projection models (IPMs) that investigated the effects of floral herbivory on the population growth rate X, equilibrium population size, and the evolutionary stable (ES) flowering strategy. The IPMs showed that native insects have significant impact on the equilibrium population size and lambda, but not the ES flowering strategy, because they use the flowers of different-sized plants indiscriminately. In contrast, Rhinocyllus has the potential to drive Platte thistle extinct. Rhinocyllus preferentially fed and oviposited on the flowers of larger plants and therefore selected for a reduction in flowering size. However, as the thistle population went into decline, this pattern reversed. Thus, selection imposed by an invader may be complex and will reflect behavioral interactions between herbivore and host, as well as demographic changes in the host population.

AB Few individuals in canopy tree species attain the canopy and reproduce. Understanding why these select few succeed is fundamental to tree population ecology and forest community dynamics. Yet our understanding remains poor, because the time required to reach the canopy is long relative to experimental and demographic studies. We used a simple, yet powerful, approach to examine the long-term process of canopy recruitment. We compared early growth in proven "winners" (extant canopy trees) with that of "contenders" (extant saplings 75 cm tall to 5 cm dbh). The resulting analyses relate early radial growth (after reaching 50 cm height) to survival, implicit in the long-term persistence of winners. We focused on the three major tree species of subalpine forests in the northeastern United States: shade-intolerant mountain birch (Betula cordifolia), shade-tolerant balsam fir (Abies balsamea), and highly shade-tolerant red spruce (Picea rubens).
   For all species, extant canopy trees grew faster than extant saplings at equivalent ages and sizes. For shade-intolerant B. cord folia, no surviving canopy trees, or even saplings, had slow early growth. Even in shade-tolerant A. balsamea and P. rubens, surprisingly few individuals with slow early growth were represented in the canopy, even though both saplings and canopy trees survived slow growth for up to 50 years later in life. Thus, long-term success in reaching the canopy was strongly determined by fast early growth rates, across all species and life histories. We discuss implications for understanding the physiology of shade tolerance and for modeling forest dynamics. Most current models of forest tree population and community dynamics ignore individual growth history, but our results suggest that failure to account for growth history may overestimate long-term survival of shade-tolerant species.
