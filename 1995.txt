AB Frugivorous birds consumed >75% of the ripe fruits of a Prunus mahaleb population in southeastern Spain, but only half of the seed crop was successfully removed from parent plants by legitimate seed dispersers. For two consecutive years, I studied the sign and magnitude of phenotypic selection exerted by frugivorous birds on fruit size and seed mass, two key traits in this mutualistic plant-seed disperser interaction. Individual plants showed extensive phenotypic variation in these traits, but among-individual variation accounted for <30% of total trait variance. Selection patterns were assessed at two levels by separating the effects of selection acting on the parent tree (among-crop selection; comparing fruit removal and seed dispersal efficiency among individual plants) and selection acting at the individual seed level (comparing seed mass variation before and after dispersal by frugivorous birds). Dispersal efficiency (percentage of the seed crop dispersed) correlated negatively with crop size, fruit size, and seed mass. However, only crop size was significantly, positively, correlated with the absolute number of seeds dispersed relative to the population mean, used as the estimator for relative fitness. Greater visitation by dispersers to smaller plants compensated for their lower fecundity but, for plants with larger crops, a greater number of seeds was dispersed despite lower dispersal efficiency. Directional and stabilizing/disruptive selection gradients on fruit traits were not significant or, at best, only marginally significant, indicative of weak and inconsistent selection effects on maternal phenotypes. In contrast, selection on individual seed phenotypes was significant. Seeds on the ground, after successful dispersal by frugivorous birds, were significantly smaller than seeds 'available' at the start of the fruiting season. Observed selection differentials on individual seed mass were -0.12 (1992) and -0.13 (1993), suggesting that frugivores might exert strong selection on individual seed phenotypes irrespective of the maternal phenotype. This selection regime, with far-reaching demographic consequences but low potential for inducing evolutionary change in fruit traits, is expected on the basis of known hierarchical selection cues used by foraging frugivores. Fruit phenotypic variation might be irrelevant as a cue used by birds for discrimination among fruit crops, but, given extensive within-crop variation, frugivores might strongly select among seed phenotypes in a process not related consistently to among-crop selection on maternal phenotypes.

AB On exposed soils relationships between soil surface characteristics and seed morphological attributes often determine the microsites of seed entrapment and influence patterns of seedling establishment. I examined seed and seedling fates of alpine species with varying morphology over a range of uniform- and mixed-particle-size soils on the Beartooth Plateau, Montana. Physical relationships between seeds and surface soils determined entrapment and retention within the zone of potential emergence (0-1 cm depth). Seed size (length or mass), the presence or absence of specialized appendages or seed coats, and the nature of the appendage or seed coat influenced numbers of seeds trapped and seed distributions among the particle sizes. Antrorse hairs, hygroscopic awns, pappuses, and mucilaginous seed coats all resulted in higher entrapment over the range of particle sizes. The effectiveness of different seed morphologies was decreased by prolonged exposure (1 yr) to the environment. In contrast to seed entrapment and retention, seedling emergence and survival depended on the ability of the different particle-size soils to meet the biological requirements of the species. Although some seedling emergence occurred in particle sizes that ranged from <0.5 to 4-8 mm, almost no seedlings survived in particle sizes larger than 1-2 mm. In particle sizes in which emergence occurred, a higher percentage of the total seeds trapped survived the first, growing season as seedlings for large-seeded than for small-seeded species. For most species, the highest entrapment and retention occurred in particle sizes in which there was little or no emergence. Seedling emergence and survival were related to seed entrapment only for species with reasonably high emergence, and the R(2) values were often low. Understanding seedling establishment patterns in different-particle-size soils requires knowledge of how relationships between seed morphology and soil characteristics affect entrapment patterns, and knowledge of soil particle size thresholds for seedling establishment.

AB We examined the effects of gap size on rates of mass loss of leaf, branch and bark litter, and microbial activity in a Castanopsis kawakamii forest over a 360-d period. Fiver forest gap size classes that comprise a gap size gradient were chosen: (1) closed canopy of pure Castanopsis kawakamii vegetation; (2) small gaps with a diameter of < 5 m; (3) small-to-intermediate gaps with a diameter of 5-15 m; (4) intermediate-to-large gaps with a diameter of 15-30 m; (5) large gaps with a diameter of > 30 m. After 360 d, plant litter decomposing under closed canopy or within the small gaps lost mass more rapidly than those in the large gaps. Among the litter quality parameters measured, initial id concentrations were most strongly positively correlated with the annual decay rates, and among the microclimatic factors, soil moisture content was the best predictor.
   Total substrate-induced respiration (SIR) was highest under closed canopy, intermediate in small gaps, and lowest in large gap size classes. Within gap size classes, total microbial respiration was highest for leaves, intermediate for bark, and lowest for branches. Across all sample dates, soil moisture content was the best predictor of microbial activity among the measured microclimatic factors. Plant litter C/N ratios were best predictors of microbial activity among the measured litter quality indices. Decomposition rate constants were linearly correlated with overall mean values of microbial activities for all three types of decomposing litter within five different gap size classes (R(2) = 0.984). The SIR rates of decomposing plant fitter as a measure of potential active microbial biomass reflected the microclimate and litter quality. Our results suggest that large gaps significantly reduce microbial activity and decomposition rates by changing environmental conditions that consequently should reduce nutrient cycling rates in this system.

AB Given the increased recognition of the importance of spatial aggregation of infected individuals on disease spread, we used a held experiment to examine spore dispersal and disease transmission at increasing distances from an inoculum source in a well-studied system, the herbaceous plant Silene alba, infected by the anther-smut fungus Ustilago violacea. Two different life stages (vegetative and floral) were examined. We measured spore deposition on flowers and, as an analog of dispersal to vegetative plants, in small vials on the ground. Spore and disease gradients (number of spores or proportion of plants infected as a function of distance) were best fit with the classic power law, Y = aD(-b). The slope parameter, b, was similar for spore dispersal gradients of vegetative (b = -2.38) and flowering plants (b = -1.91), However, at every distance measured, the proportion of flowers with spores was higher than the proportion of ground vials with spores, indicating overall higher relative spore dispersal to flowering plants. We also determined that disease gradients for flowering plants were more shallow (b = -0.07) than spore dispersal gradients, and vegetative infection was more spatially restricted than floral infection (no infection beyond 3.2 m for vegetative plants while floral infection was detected up to 11.2 m). The relationship between spore dispersal and disease incidence was linear for vegetative plants and curvilinear for flowering plants, with limiting returns on disease after a low threshold number of spores deposited, Overall, our study suggests that the limited dispersal of spores is likely to be important in the aggregation of diseased plants in nature; such aggregation of inoculum in turn can increase or decrease disease spread depending on how much inoculum is needed to cause infection.

AB In order to clarify regeneration traits and their fitness, we compared seed fall, seedling emergence, and first-year seedling survival of four co-occurring species, Carpinus tschonoskii, C. japonica C. laxiflora, and C. cordata, in an old-growth temperate deciduous forest in Ogawa Forest Reserve, central Japan. Seedling emergence ratio of C. cot-data (5.5%), whose seeds mostly germinated 1.5 yr after seed fall, was lower than the other species (8.5-11.2%). First-year seedlings of Carpinus tschonoskii and C. japonica had much lower survival rates (2.7%, both species) than C. laxiflora and C. cop darn (7.5-8.5%) under closed canopy, suggesting that the former two are more disturbance dependent than the latter two. They are characterized by their seed and seedling performances as seed rain type fundamentally; however, C. cordata and C. laxiflora are able to establish a seedling bank, and C. cordata has a seed bank too. These regenerative strategies partly explain the abundance and population structure of the four species in this old-growth forest. Multiple regression analyses showed that topography was important for survival of all species but C. cordata. This result was consistent with the adult distribution of these species in this forest. Wind dispersal of Car-pinus is effective, both to escape from density- or distance-dependent high mortality and to increase the chance of arriving at canopy gaps, where seedling survival rate is high. However, escaping high mortality seems relatively more important for C. laxiflora and C. cordata (seedling bank strategy), and arriving at a canopy gap is relatively more important for C. tschonoskii and C. japonica (seed rain strategy).

AB Life history variation and genotype composition were studied in two species of the Daphnia longispina group: the relatively large D. galeata (1.4 mm) and the smaller D. cucullata (0.9 mm). Several multi-locus genotypes of these species were compared with genotypes of their interspecific hybrid, D. cucullata X D. galeata. Both species and the hybrid co-occur in the shallow eutrophic Tjeukemeer. For two successive years, laboratory life table experiments were conducted at three temperatures (12.5 degrees, 17.5 degrees, and 22.5 degrees C) and two food levels (carbon concentrations 0.62 and 1.64 mu g/mL) to study the mechanisms that permit coexistence of taxa in this Daphnia hybrid species complex. Three-way analyses of variance showed significant main effects (e.g., temperature, food level, taxon) for most reproductive traits (e.g., number of newborns, age at first reproduction, number of juvenile instars, intrinsic rate of increase) among the Daphnia taxa. For size-related traits (e.g., size at maturity and offspring size) only one main effect, taxon, was found. Hybrids were intermediate to the parental species with respect to size at maturity. offspring size, and number of newborns. For developmental traits (number of juvenile instars and age at maturity) the hybrids tended to have the lowest values for all conditions. The intrinsic rate of increase (r) of the hybrid did not differ significantly from that of D. galeata, but was significantly higher than that of D. cucullata. We argue that essentially r will reach higher values for the hybrids than for D. galeata, because of the strong influence of size-selective fish predation. Our results are discussed in reference to different theories about the maintenance of hybrid species complexes in nature.

AB Patterns of nitrogen trace gas emissions, soil nitrogen flux, and nutrient availability were evaluated at five sites that form a chronosequence in Hawaiian montane rain forest. The estimated age of basaltic parent material from which soils developed at the Kilauea site was 200 yr, 6000 yr at the Puu Makaala site, 185 000 yr at the Kohala site, 1.65 x 10(6) yr at the Molokai site, and 4.5 X 10(6) yr at the Kauai site. Peak net N mineralization and nitrification values were found in soils from the 185 000-yr-old Kohala site. Nitrogen content of foliage and leaf litter was highest in the intermediate age sites (Puu Makaala and Kohala) and N and P retranslocation was lowest at the Puu Makaala site. Soil cores fertilized with nitrogen had significantly higher rates of root ingrowth than control cores at the two youngest sites (200 and 6000 yr old) but not in older sites (185 000 and 4.5 X 10(6)-yr-old sites) and total fine root growth into control cores was greatest at the Kohala site. The highest N2O emissions were found at the 185 000-yr-old Kohala site, while the highest combined flux of N2O + NO was observed at the 4.5 x 10(6)-yr-old Kauai site. While overall N2O emission rates were correlated with rates of N transformations, soil water content appeared to influence the magnitude of emissions of N2O and the ratios of emissions of NO vs. N2O. N2O emissions occurred when water-filled pore space (WFPS) values were >40%, with highest emissions in at least two sites observed at WFPS values of 75%. Among sites, high N2O emissions were associated with high soil N transformation rates. Large NO fluxes were observed only at the Kauai site when WFPS values were <60%.

AB To study the hierarchy of variables involved in the year-to-year dynamics in the distribution of Neotropical migratory birds, we compared observed numbers of local extinctions and recolonizations to those expected under six hypothetical mechanisms of settlement by returning spring migrants. These mechanisms were (1) random dispersal among forest fragments; (2) passive sampling of spring migrants according to fragment area; (3) dispersal among fragments between years according to the distance to the nearest fragment occupied the Ist yr; (4) resettlement of spring migrants according to the vertical structure of the vegetation in the fragments; (5) site fidelity of experienced breeders; (6) a combination of mechanisms 2, 3, 4, and 5. We selected four target species: Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia), Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), and Scarlet Tanager (Piranga olivacea). In 50 fragments of mature deciduous forest (3.0-129.8 ha, median = 11.8 ha) within a 10 X 10 km square, we recorded the presence of any target species and an abundance index in two successive breeding seasons. Absences were validated using song playbacks. Except for the random dispersal model, each hypothetical mechanism was simulated using logistic regressions on empirical data. Frequencies of population turnovers (local extinctions + recolonizations) were 16-28% between the two breeding seasons, varying with species. Observed numbers of population turnovers were best approximated by the combination model (model 6). Expected numbers of population turnovers were consistently higher than observed numbers for models 1-4, suggesting that between-year dynamics were constrained by some process(es). Our simulations suggest that site fidelity might be an important constraint on the distributional dynamics of these species, even when effects of fragment area and habitat on site fidelity are factored out. This finding has important implications far the response of Neotropical migrant birds to the fragmentation of their habitat.

AB We measured legume abundance following 13- and 5-yr experiments testing for the effects of mammalian herbivores, nutrients, and climate on plant communities in an old field and a savanna in east central Minnesota. Total legume abundance was significantly greater in plots with herbivores excluded. Within herbivore exclosures, legumes were more abundant in plots to which P, K, S, Mg, Mn, Ca, Na, and trace minerals had been added. Legumes were significantly more abundant in the savanna than in the old field. Lathyrus venosus, a rapidly growing early-maturing species, was largely responsible for these results. Two other common legumes at our study site, Amorpha canescens and Lespedeza capitata, were not significantly affected by herbivore exclosures. However, within herbivore exclosures, addition of nutrients significantly reduced Lespedeza. Late summer total legume biomass within herbivore exclosures increased strongly following exclosure establishment in 1982, declined dramatically following a severe drought in 1988, and then increased again following the drought. This trend suggested that herbivore effects we measured in 1994 resulted from long-term accumulation of legumes following the establishment of exclosures. Our results suggest that herbivores and nutrients other than nitrogen can dramatically limit the abundance of some legume species that might otherwise dominate grassland plant communities on nitrogen-poor soils. Limitation of legumes by colonization and drought may also be important. Thus, herbivores and nutrients other than nitrogen may be critical in structuring grassland plant communities and influencing succession, even on nitrogen-poor soils.

AB This article discusses two types of proposed relationships between resource productivity and the diversity of coexisting Consumer species. Monotonically increasing curves have recently been dismissed on both empirical and theoretical grounds, while unimodal (''hump-shaped'') curves have been supported. Unimodal curves have been attributed to increased competitive exclusion, usually as the result of decreased heterogeneity in limiting resources at high productivities. This article argues that: (1) there are many viable mechanisms that can produce monotonic curves in the presence of competition; (2) there is little empirical support for any of the major variants of the hypothesis that productivity decreases heterogeneity, which increases competitive exclusion; and (3) there are alternative reasons for unimodal curves, some or all of which are consistent with previously observed productivity-diversity relationships. Additional theoretical and empirical work is required to understand what relationships follow from different mechanisms of competition, and what relationships are most frequently observed under different observational protocols.

AB I investigated the effects of an abiotic factor, pH, and a biotic factor, interspecific competition, on breeding success in a low-pH tolerant anuran, Hyla andersonii. I tested whether low pH would indirectly facilitate H. andersonii by lessening the impact of competition from two less acid-tolerant species. I also tested whether the competitive effect of an allotopic, closely related species (Hyla versicolor) would be greater than that of a syntopic, more distantly related species (Rana sphenacephala). I exposed H. andersonii sonii tadpoles to two levels of pH (3.9, ambient) and three levels of competition (H. versicolor, R. sphenocephala, and none). Reduced pH had no direct effect on any of the species and did not influence the outcome of interspecific competition. Competition from X. sphenocephala decreased survival and mass of H. andersonii, whereas competition from H. versicolor only decreased mass, without affecting survival of H. andersonii. These results suggest that some other correlate of low pH in natural ponds limits H. andersonii to acidic ponds. Further, the assumptions that co-occurrence or level of relatedness can be used as a gauge of competitive strength are shown to be unreliable.

AB Action in theoretical physics is an abstract quantity describing the overall motion of a system; action has the dimensions of energy x time (in joule-seconds). The Principle of Least Action states that physical systems follow that path for which the action has the least value. By analogy, we hypothesize that, if the principle of least action is universal, ecosystems must be structured on interaction between this principle of least action and an overriding Principle of Most Action. Most action implies energy acquisition, concentration, and conservation. In an autonomous ecosystem a trophic hierarchy is formed in which, for stability, the action increases at each hierarchical level. We predicted that energy density (in joules per gram), being one of the components of most action, must increase at each level along the food chain. This prediction was tested in Keyhole Lake, a small Arctic lake in the Canadian Northwest Territories, and found to be substantiated. The major non-conformity with the hypothesis was found in the zooplankton, which at ail times showed the highest energy density. We concluded that the plankton forms an essentially separate compartment of the ecosystem. Total biomass energy in each hierarchical level confirmed the existence of an energy pyramid, in which the relationship between levels exhibited the characteristics of an inverse cooling curve. An autonomous lake, such as Keyhole Lake, may be regarded as the nearest approach in the natural world to a reference system, against which other systems may be evaluated.

AB Stream fish sometimes show multimodal distributions, with high densities in the tributaries of a river but rarity or absence in the river itself. To assess if predation can produce such a fragmented distributional pattern on a large geographic scale, we determined the density and habitat use of a prey fish in two tropical stream watersheds, each with a barrier waterfall that split the drainage into a region with a strongly piscivorous fish and a region lacking a strong piscivore. In contrast to sites with the strong piscivore, the prey fish in areas above barriers showed a dramatic expansion into the main river, thereby spatially consolidating an otherwise fragmented distribution. Manipulation of piscivores in a third-order stream flanked by a series of first-order experimental streams also showed that the prey distribution expanded into the third-order stream when piscivores were excluded, and that the presence of the piscivores in the third-order stream reduced prey densities both by killing the prey and by inducing the prey to ascend cascades to enter the tributaries.
   Because the predator created spatial fragmentation of the prey population, we examined prey-fish dispersal in the experimental stream facility to ask whether the predator could reduce prey movement into and beyond the predator-occupied sites. As hypothesized, the experiment revealed that predators could block prey dispersal by killing prey. However, the experiment also suggested that predators may increase prey movement between tributaries by inducing shifts out of river sites. The results suggest that realistic models of dispersal by prey would need to account for effects of both predator consumption and prey behavioral responses to the predator.

AB Variation in offspring size is a common phenomenon in many organisms. In cladoceran zooplankton large offspring are known to have a high starvation resistance. One could, therefore, expect offspring to be large at low food levels, whereas at higher food levels the production of more, but smaller, offspring would yield the highest parental fitness. However, in Daphnia galeata I found that individual offspring were smallest at a low food level and largest at intermediate food levels. Moreover, in contrast to the pre dictions made by several theoretical models, I found that large mothers produced larger offspring. The first discrepancy between data and theory could be explained by the existence of a maximum offspring size, combined with the difficulty of Daphnia to produce one egg less than was done in reality. The dependence of offspring size on maternal size could be explained by the higher likelihood of intraspecific competition when large (=old) females are present, and hence higher starvation risks for the offspring. It was found that embryonic respiration was lowest at the lower food levels, and hence the smaller individual egg size seemed to be compensated by lower carbon losses during development.

AB The ecological basis for breeding-system evolution was explored in Ecballium elaterium (L.) A. Rich. (Cucurbitaceae). Two subspecies are parapatric on the Iberian Peninsula: dioicum (dioecious) is found in southern, more arid regions and elaterium (monoecious) is found in northern, wetter regions. Six experimental gardens were set up in three sites that span the climatic gradient of the species' natural range in Spain in order to address two issues: (1) gender specialization in reproductive characters and life history, and (2) ecological specialization of the two subspecies across environments.
   Overall, the dioecious subspecies outperformed the monoecious subspecies. Monoecious plants, on average, were shorter-lived in all environments. Females of the dioecious subspecies produced similar numbers of female flowers, but more fruits and seeds, than did monoecious plants (cosexuals). The fruits of females contained more, but smaller, seeds than the fruits of cosexuals. Males always produced more male flowers than did cosexuals, disproportionately so with increased plant size (canopy volume); no such disproportionate increase in seed production was found in females.
   A geographic analysis of gender (proportion of female flowers) in the monoecious plants revealed a striking pattern: dimorphism with increased gender differentiation in drier sites, in contrast to monomorphism with respect to gender in wetter sites.
   Differences between the subspecies and between habitat types can be related directly to breeding-system differences. The higher overall performance of dioecious plants may be due to enhanced heterozygosity resulting from outcrossing enforced by dioecy. On the other hand, the gender differentiation of the monoecious plants in the drier sites may reflect gender allocation ''decisions'' enforced by limited resource availability.

AB Surface fire intensity (kilowatts per metre) and crown fire initiation were predicted using Rothermel's 1972 and Van Wagner's 1977 fire models with fuel data from 47 upland subalpine conifer stands varying in age from 22-258 yr and 35 yr of daily weather data (fuel moisture and wind speeds). Rothermel's intensity model was divided into a fuel component variable and weather component variable, which were then used to examine the relative roles of fuel and weather on surface fire intensity (kilowatts per metre). Similar variables were defined in the crown fire initiation model of Van Wagner. Both surface fire intensity and crown fire initiation were strongly related to the weather components and weakly related to the fuel components, due to much greater variability in weather than fuel, and stronger relationship to the fire behavior mechanisms for weather than for fuel. Fire intensity was correlated to annual area burned; large area burned years had higher fire intensity predictions than smaller area burned years. The reason for this difference was attributed directly to the weather variable frequency distribution, which was shifted towards more extreme values in years in which large areas burned. During extreme weather conditions, the relative importance of fuels diminishes since all stands achieve the threshold required to permit crown fire development. This is important since most of the area burned in subalpine forests has historically occurred during very extreme weather (i.e., drought coupled to high winds). The fire behavior relationships predicted in the models support the concept that forest fire behavior is determined primarily by weather variation among years rather than fuel variation associated with stand age.

AB In coniferous forests of Central Finland, Willow (Parus montanus) and Crested Tits (P. cristatus) store seeds in a scattered distribution within their territory during the autumn. Individuals cache and recover food items while moving together as members of mixed-species flocks. The purpose of this study was to test certain predictions of scatter-hoarding models (Stapanian and Smith 1978, Clarkson et al. 1986), which predict how the animal should hoard food items from a superabundant source to maximize the number of caches recovered. Our field experiments gave support to most of the predictions of the models. Individual tits stored seeds closer to the food source when food had been available for first time (new feeder with seeds not previously available) than to feeders with seed available for 1 mo. Individual birds of both species carried large food items (hulled sunflower seeds) farther than small items (spruce seeds) before caching them. Crested Tits distributed their caches uniformly around the feeder while most of the Willow Tits favored certain sectors around the feeder. Subdominant individuals carried seeds the same distances as did dominant birds when the food source was ephemeral, but farther from a continuously available food source.

AB When Leo Luckinbill (1973) grew Paramecium aurelia together with its predator Didinium nasutum in 6 mt of standard cerophyl medium, the Didinium consumed all the prey in a few hours, When the medium was thickened with methyl cellulose, the populations went through two or three diverging oscillations lasting several days before becoming extinct. When he used a half-strength cerophyl medium thickened with methyl cellulose, the populations maintained sustained oscillations for 33 d before the experiment was terminated. The data from this experiment provide a rare opportunity to test current predator-prey models.
   A standard differential equation predator-prey model with a carrying capacity for the prey and a saturating (Type 2) functional response predicts the outcome Luckinbill's experiment qualitatively, but does not give a good quantitative fit to the data, Several modifications of this model are tested against the data for the populations grown in the medium thickened with methyl cellulose, using the Marquardt-Levenberg method to obtain the least squares best fit. Neither Leslie type models nor models with a ratio-dependent functional response do well, but adding either predator mutual interference or a sigmoid (Type 3) functional response improves the fit dramatically. Modeling the predator growth rate to depend on energy or nutrient storage instead of directly on the rate of consumption of prey, thus creating a delayed numerical response, along with predator mutual interference or a sigmoid functional response, produced the best models and gave excellent fits to the data. These models are further validated by the fact that changing only one or two parameter values to reflect the unthickened medium or the half-strength medium also gives reasonably good fits to the other two data sets. The last model requires a more sigmoid functional response to fit the data in the thickened than in the unthickened medium, suggesting that an increase in the cost-benefit ratio of energy spent searching to energy gained capturing prey inhibits the predator searching at low prey densities.

AB Fresh and dry masses of seeds of woody species collected at Mabura Hill, Guyana were evaluated according to dispersal mode, gap size preference, and soil type. Data published for woody species from Manu, Peru and Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama were analyzed by dispersal mode and gap size preference for comparison. Larger seeds at the three sites were significantly associated with canopy or emergent trees or lianas that are dispersed by mammals or gravity and recruit best in small gaps. Variation in seed size, after accounting for the effects of plant height and life-form, could be explained by dispersal mode (Mabura Hill: 22%, Manu: 14%, BCI: 26%) and gap size preference (Mabura Hill: 9%, Manu: 7%, BCI: 11%). Soil type preference, analyzed only for Mabura Hill, was not associated with seed size. Mean seed size at Mabura Hill was significantly larger than at Manu or BCI. Short-term successional processes may explain the variation of seed size within sites; dispersal mode is particularly important in defining seed size selection during a the successional process. However, short-term successional processes cannot explain the variation of seed size among sites. It is suggested that this variation may be attributed to differences in the effects of larger-scale variations in soils and disturbance on seed size among the three sites.

AB The downstream displacement of individuals by drifting in the current is a prominent feature in the population biology of stream invertebrates. To compensate for the loss of individuals it has been proposed that adults of aquatic insects preferentially fly upstream to oviposit and thereby maintain populations, The observation of adult flight biased in the upstream direction has been advanced as confirmation of the hypothesis. I argue here that upstream-biased dispersal is not sufficient for population persistence nor is it necessary. Population persistence can only be explained on the basis of density dependence at some point in the life cycle. Computer simulations showed that density dependence by itself is not sufficient for population persistence. Infrequent dispersal by randomly flying adults coupled with density dependence does allow population persistence.
   Upstream-biased dispersal can be explained by increased individual fitness. If upstream reaches are depopulated by drift, these reaches provide more rapid growth to successful colonists. Computer simulations of competition for space by two genotypes that differ only in the directionality of dispersal showed that genotypes with upstream-biased dispersal always drove random dispersers to extinction.

AB We quantified the effects of position within treefall gaps, gap size, and sapling size on sapling radial increment (most recent 5 yr, using tree cores) for two species of Nothofagus (southern beech) on the South Island, New Zealand (42 degrees 13' S).
   Mean radial growth rates of the two species and characteristics of the gaps in which they occurred were similar. Based on regression analysis, stems (1.4-26 m tall) of both species grew faster in larger gaps than smaller gaps (canopy gap area range 16-528 m(2)) and larger stems grew faster than smaller ones, the latter more true of N. fusca than iV. menziesii. N. fusca grew fastest near gap center; N. menziesii grew fastest south of gap center. Smaller stems of both species grew faster south of gap center and large ones faster at, or even north of, gap center. For all size classes, the optimum location for N. menziesii growth was further south than for N. fusca. N.fusca grew faster than N. menziesii near gap center; N. menziesii grew faster than N.fusca south of gap center.
   These results are intermediate between literature predictions of best growth in gap center (based on soil moisture, soil nutrients and diffuse radiation) and best growth near the south gap edge (based on direct beam radiation and without considering shading).

AB The role of interspecific interactions among herbivorous insects is considered to be limited, especially in specialist communities. In the current study we report on exploitative interspecific interaction between two closely related phloem-feeding species of gall-forming aphids (Homoptera; Pemphigidae; Fordinae), mediated by the supply of photoassimilates from the host plant.
   Geoica sp. forms a spherical gall on the leaflet midrib of Pistacia palaestina (Anacardiaceae), while Forda formicaria forms crescent-shaped galls on the leaflet margin of the same host plant. Using C-14 labeling, we were able to trace the food supply (assimilated carbohydrates) from the leaves to galls of each species. We found that Geoica galls are strong sinks. These galls divert the normal phloem transport of the plant and reduce the amount of assimilates imported by F. formicaria, especially when they are located on the same leaflet. By the end of the season Geoica caused death of 84% of F. formicaria galls that were located on the same leaflet, and reduced reproductive success in the surviving galls by 20%. This is because the presence of Geoica causes early senescence (but not abscission) of the leaflet it is on (whether or not F. formicaria is present). The interaction is asymmetrical: F. formicaria did not affect reproductive output of Geoica nor did it cause visible damage to the leaflets. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of exploitation competition for plant assimilates between two insect-induced sinks.
   This exploitative competition, mediated by manipulation of plant phloem transport, stands in contrast to the absence of interference competition for galling sites between the two aphid species. Although their spatial distributions partly overlapped, the niche breadth of each species (measured from gall positions on leaves along the shoot axis) was not affected by the presence of the other. Moreover, when both species were located on the same leaf, they formed galls independently on the same or different leaflets, and there was no indication of interference competition over galling sites.

AB Fire season influenced the cover of species and flowering guilds of plants in replicated grass and forb plantings of tallgrass prairie species in Wisconsin. Over two burn cycles at 3-yr intervals, cover increased in the rhizomatous perennials Andropogon geuardii, Aster simplex and Solidago altissima in plots burned in spring, or summer, or left unburned, but cover showed dramatic positive or negative responses to spring or summer burns in Agropyron repens, Erigeron annuus, Panicum virgatum, Phalaris arundinacea, and Rudbeckia hirta. Aggregate response of flowering guilds was stronger. By the last (1993) census, the phenological guild flowering before mid-July (summed cover values for nine species) accounted for 4% cover in unburned plots and <2% cover in plots burned in early spring, but 32% cover in plots burned in midsummer. The late-flowering guild (summed values for 21 species) accounted for 93% cover in unburned plots anti 97% cover in plots burned in early spring, but 66% cover in plots burned in midsummer. Remaining space was taken by a mid-season guild(li species), only one of which (E. annuus) was common enough for individual statistical analysis,
   These results have implications for succession of prairie vegetation under different seasonal fire regimes. Over 8 yr, summer fires that simulated the timing of lightning fires retarded progression to dominance of large, late-flowering C-4 grasses, allowing early-flowering species eliminated in other treatments to persist or even prosper. Primaeval lightning fires in midsummer may have produced quite different communities than anthropogenic fires, which are rarely set during the middle of the growing season.

AB We measured survival and growth of three shade-tolerant species of maple (Acer pensylvanicum, A. rubrum, and A. saccharum) in response to understory and experimentally created small canopy gaps of two sizes (8 X 12 m, 75 m(2); 16 x 24 m, 300 m(2)) in central New England. Seedlings of the three species (2160 total, 720 per species) were transplanted into five plot locations (center plus northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast gap edges) within all gap and understory sites. Measurements of microclimates, architecture, photosynthetic performance, survival, and growth were made over 1 yr before, and 2 yr following, gap release.
   Red maple (A. rubrum) survived better overall across the study due to greater persistence in the north and center plots of large gaps. The small gaps and understories showed no differences among the species. Survival rates exceeded 80% in most sites and plots, with low values (30-65%) only in the exposed plots of large gaps. There were no relationships between post-gap survival and previous age, height, or basal diameter.
   By the end of 2 yr of gap release, both gap sizes induced greater distinctions among the species in all growth variables than the understory. Striped maple (A. pensylvanicum) exhibited greater leader extension, absolute stem height, net height change, absolute basal diameter, and net basal diameter change than red maple and sugar maple (in that order) in nearly all sites and plots. The exception was large-gap center and north plots, where red maple equalled or exceeded striped maple in net basal diameter change, but not net height increase. Sugar maple (A. saccharum) was the least responsive of the species to the gap-understory gradient. As with survival, there were no predictable relationships between pre-gap age or size and post-gap growth.
   Photosynthetic performance paralleled growth by these species across the gradient, particularly for school assimilation. When growth variables were plotted against irradiance and temperature measured at seedling plot positions, there were consistent and clear distinctions among species across the gap-understory gradient, providing limited evidence for gap partitioning in our system. Striped maple appears to be a superior generalist, red maple is a weaker generalist, and sugar maple shows the poorest performance in a manner that is nearly insensitive to the gap-understory gradient in our experimental system.

AB The effects of dietary protein and energy on ingestion and growth were determined for nutrient ranges that correspond to primary foods in freshwaters: algae, aquatic macrophytes and organic detritus. Sixteen diets containing four levels of metabolizable energy (ME) (3.1, 6.7, 10.5, 14.1 kJ/g) and four levels of protein (3.0, 13.2, 23.2, 33.4 mg/kJ ME) were each fed ad libitum to four replicate groups of juvenile Tilapia aurea for 42 d. Protein, energy, and protein-energy interaction affected both ingestion and growth (two-way ANOVA, all P < 0.01). Increased ingestion largely compensated for lower energy levels within each protein level. Growth was proportional to diet protein content, and ingestion did not compensate for protein limitation. A second-order polynomial for growth as a function of diet protein content and energy assimilation rate fitted by linear regression accounts for 91% of variation in growth, and provides a model for comparison of the relative importance of protein and energy as nutritional constraints for animals feeding on invertebrate prey, algae, aquatic macrophytes, and organic detritus. Protein appears to be the primary constraint to food value of macrophytes, and detritus, and we predict from our results that consumers of these materials will increase growth most by feeding selectively on the most protein-rich material available, as has been observed. In contrast, growth of animals feeding on algae will be increased most by increased ingestion. Omnivory is interpreted as a compromise strategy in which protein from scarce animal prey is complemented by energy from abundant primary foods.

AB We manipulated light, temperature, and nutrients in moist tussock tundra near Toolik Lake, Alaska to determine how global changes in these parameters might affect community and ecosystem processes. Some of these manipulations altered nutrient availability, growth-form composition, net primary production, and species richness in less than a decade, indicating that arctic vegetation at this site is sensitive to climatic change. In general, short-term (3-yr) responses were poor predictors of longer term (9-yr) changes in community composition. The longer term responses showed closer correspondence to patterns of vegetation distribution along environmental gradients. Nitrogen and phosphorus availability tended to increase in response to elevated temperature, reflecting increased mineralization, and in response to light attenuation, reflecting reduced nutrient uptake by vegetation. Nutrient addition increased biomass and production of deciduous shrubs but reduced growth of evergreen shrubs and nonvascular plants. Light attenuation reduced biomass of all growth forms. Elevated temperature enhanced shrub production but reduced production of nonvascular plants. These contrasting responses to temperature increase and to nutrient addition by different growth forms ''canceled out'' at the ecosystem level, buffering changes in ecosystem characteristics such as biomass, production, and nutrient uptake. The major effect of elevated temperature was to speed plant response to changes in soil resources and, in the long term (9 yr), to increase nutrient availability through changes in N mineralization. Species within a growth form were similar to one another in their responses to changes in resources (light or nutrients) but showed no consistent response to elevated temperature. Species richness was reduced 30-50% by temperature and nutrient treatments, due to loss of less abundant species. Declines in diversity occurred disproportionately in forbs, which are important for animal nutrition, and in mosses, which maintain soil thermal regime. There was no increased abundance of initially rare species in response to any treatment.
   During our 9-yr study (the warmest decade on record in the region), biomass of one dominant tundra species unexpectedly changed in control plots in the direction predicted by our experiments and by Holocene pollen records. This suggests that regional climatic warming may already be altering the species composition of Alaskan arctic tundra.

AB I combined long-term (10 yr) descriptive and short-term experimental studies in a headwater stream in northern Minnesota to assess: (1) the effect of annual variation in stream discharge and spatial proximity of beaver (Castor canadensis) ponds on lotic fish abundance and (2) the subsequent influence of discharge and fish predation on lotic invertebrate colonization. Considerable annual variation in fish density occurred in the stream over the 10-yr period, particularly in pool habitats. Increased fish density was associated with increased stream discharge and creation of beaver ponds downstream from the study site. Weir traps used to monitor directional (upstream vs. downstream) fish movement during the last 4 yr of the study indicated annual changes in fish density were associated with the amount of fish dispersal occurring along the stream segment. Downstream fish movement, out of an upstream beaver pond occurred primarily during periods of elevated stream discharge. Upstream movement, out of a downstream beaver pond, occurred over a broader range of discharge conditions. A controlled, ''split-stream,'' experiment examining the effect of very low vs. elevated discharge on upstream fish movement indicated, however, that upstream movement of fish out of beaver ponds was also reduced by very low discharge conditions. Movement data for individual fish species revealed considerable variation among the taxa in the tendency for downstream vs. upstream movement, due to variation in the morphology of upstream vs. downstream beaver ponds and its subsequent effect on the composition of fish dispersing from these source areas. Most fish movement occurred over relatively brief time periods, suggesting life history and developmental processes were critical in influencing the timing of dispersal. Size structure of fishes captured in the stream indicated predominantly older age classes (>age I) of fish were dispersing along the stream. However, based on the occurrence of age 0 individuals only 1 of 12 species, the creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), routinely reproduced in the stream.
   Experiments conducted in an artificial stream located below one of the beaver ponds indicated discharge and fish predation have potentially strong and interactive effects on invertebrate colonization in stream ecosystems. Differences in colonization of riffles and pools under low vs. elevated discharge and fish vs. no-fish treatments suggested, however, that the interactive effect of these factors on invertebrate colonization was variable over even small spatial scales. Elevated discharge increased invertebrate colonization in riffles but decreased invertebrate colonization in pools. Contrary to intuitive expectations, fish predation reduced invertebrate colonization more under elevated than low discharge conditions, particularly in pool habitats.
   Taken together, these results suggest: (1) beaver ponds act as reproductive ''sources'' for fish on the landscape, while adjacent stream environments act as potential reproductive ''sinks,'' (2) large-scale spatial relationships between beaver ponds and streams, along with the influence of discharge on the permeability of the boundaries between these habitats, are critical in controlling fish dispersal between ponds and streams and the subsequent abundance and composition of fish in lotic ecosystems, and (3) fish predation and discharge have potentially cascading effects on invertebrate colonization in lotic ecosystems.

AB We studied soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics in allophanic soils (Udands) along independent gradients of temperature (altitude) and land use (forest-pasture) on the island of Hawaii. Using an integrated C-13 Signal derived from land conversion along with measurements of soil respiration and soil carbon, we separated rapid, intermediate, and very slow turnover SOM pools, and estimated turnover times for the large intermediate pool. These estimates were compared to independent estimates using either bomb-derived soil C-14 or the Century soil organic matter model. All calculations based on a three-pool SOM structure yield rates of turnover that are 3 times slower than those produced by a single pool model. Accordingly, analyses of potential feedbacks between changes in climate, atmospheric CO2, and soil carbon should incorporate the heterogeneous nature of soil organic matter. We estimate that roughly three-quarters of the carbon in the top 20 cm of these soils has turnover times less than 30 yr Turnover times for intermediate SOM double with a 10 degrees C change in mean annual temperature, suggesting that recalcitrant pools of SOM may be as sensitive to changes in temperature as the smaller labile pools.

AB Numerical responses of the weasel Mustela nivalis to the changes in population density of forest rodents (bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus and yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis) and predation by weasels were studied in the pristine deciduous forests of Bialowieza National Park, eastern Poland, in 1985 through 1992. The rodents experienced 5 yr of noncyclic (seasonal) fluctuations (autumn density 23-74 rodents/ha) and 2 yr of outbreak and crash (triggered by synchronous heavy crop of oak, hornbeam, and maple seeds). Autumn numbers of rodents exceeded 300 individuals/ha during the outbreak and dropped to 8 individuals/ha in the following autumn.
   Weasels were censused by livetrapping in summer and by snowtracking on an 11.2 km(2) grid of transects in winter. Radiotracking of 12 weasels in 1990 and 1991 yielded estimates of home ranges and daily movement distances, which were combined with snowtracking and livetrapping data to estimate densities during 7 yr. Estimated winter density of weasels varied from 5.2 to 27.3 individuals/10 km(2) in December and declined to 0-19.1 individuals/10 km(2) by early spring (March). Midsummer (July/August) indices of weasel numbers were extremely variable and corresponded to 41.9-47.6 individuals/10 km(2) in years with moderate density of rodents, 101.7 individuals/10 km(2) during the rodent outbreak and 19.1 individuals/10 km(2) during the crash. Increase of weasel numbers from spring to midsummer was positively related to the spring numbers of rodents. Autumn and winter decline of weasel numbers was not related to rodent density changes.
   During the outbreak and crash of the rodent population, the numbers of weasels and rodents (both sampled at 2-3 mo intervals) were positively correlated (P < 0.0005) with no time lag. Home ranges of male weasels radiotracked during the rodent outbreak were 11-37 ha (minimum convex polygon), compared to 117-216 ha during the crash year.
   The predator/prey ratio varied from 0 to 2.5 weasels/1000 rodents. The ratio was highest at low densities of rodents. With increasing numbers of rodents, the ratio declined, since rodent population growth was overwhelmingly faster than weasel population growth. In the 7 autumn-winter seasons (1 October-15 April), weasels removed, on average, 1.6 to 9.5 rodents from each hectare, i.e., from 2 to 28% of autumn numbers of rodents. Winter predation by weasels was heaviest at rodent density of approximate to 20 individuals/ha. At lower densities of rodents, the number of weasels was restricted by food shortage and the role of their predation rapidly declined. At high rodent densities, the rodent numbers by far exceeded the predatory capacity of weasels and predation percentage declined again.
   Weasel predation in relation to rodent density has the same pattern in geographic zones ranging from Turkmen deserts to European farmlands and forests.

AB Variable growth and development were imposed on the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia Smithii, to test whether the initiation of metamorphosis was determined early in larval life or remained flexible throughout development. Like anurans, larval W. smithii are specialized for a suspension-feeding way of life and they metamorphose into dispersing, reproductive adults. We therefore used models originally formulated in an amphibian context to examine the effects of modified larval growth on the triggering of metamorphosis and then used our results to reexamine metamorphosis in amphibians. Response to enhanced and decreased food regimens showed that larval growth during the first two (of four) instars affected both the time to and mass at metamorphosis. The major effects of developmental inertia are prominent for about one to two instars and then abate, but do not necessarily disappear, with each succeeding instar Despite evidence for developmental inertia in W. smithii, experiments transferring larvae from high food to starvation show that the physiological commitment to undergo metamorphosis does not take place until the last (fourth) instar and that nonzero growth during the last instar is required to trigger metamorphosis.
   All amphibian models for the initiation of metamorphosis involve the effects of rates: developmental rate and past or present growth rates. In W. smithii, there is no primacy of developmental rate and low growth rate does not stimulate metamorphosis of larvae having attained the minimum mass required for metamorphosis. An insect-derived model involving the effects of size-specific growth increments is more consistent than any amphibian model with our results in W. smithii Testing the reciprocal ability of the insect model to predict amphibian metamorphosis is not possible with current data, because no study has considered zero growth in amphibians to identify the transition from growth-dependent to growth-independent development leading to metamorphosis. This transition marks the irrevocable commitment of the organism to an ontogenetic niche shift from an aquatic larva to a terrestrial, dispersing, and reproducing adult. Identifying the proximal causes of this mechanism is fundamental to understanding how flexible growth and ontogeny of complex life cycles have adapted to variable larval environments.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of body size, foraging mode, and parental care on the relationship between clutch size and egg size in spiders. Specifically, covariation of egg size and clutch size with body size was investigated, using data from the literature, in 156 species of North American spiders from 22 families. Variance in clutch size and egg size was found to be mainly attributed to differences among genera. I therefore conducted a comparative analysis at the generic level. Results indicated that clutch and egg size were influenced by body size. Spiders from genera with larger body sizes produced larger offspring and more offspring per reproductive event than spiders from genera with smaller sized species. Relative egg number was inversely related to size of eggs produced, indicating a reproductive trade-off. Web building spiders produced more and smaller eggs than cursorial hunting spiders of a similar body size. Furthermore, cursorial spiders that guard and carry their young produced more young than those that only guard the eggs before hatching or do not guard. However, residual clutch size or residual egg size (residuals from regressions of clutch size and egg size, respectively, against female body size) did not differ among parental care groups. This study suggests that the method of food acquistion and type of parental care contributed to the offspring are associated with clutch size and egg size in spiders.

AB The effects of predation risk from snakes on microhabitat use of kangaroo rats (Dipodomys deserti and D. merriami) was studied in the Mojave Desert. I concentrated on the effects of the predator on the foraging behavior of the rodents and eliminated effects of prey capture on prey population size. Foraging stations contained three seed trays, one in each of three microhabitats (Open, Bush, Grass). The amount of seed left in each tray after one night of foraging was used to assess the responses to predation risk and other foraging costs; additional data were collected during direct observations and by trapping. To investigate the effect of snakes on foraging and microhabitat use of kangaroo rats I manipulated snake presence at the stations. I studied the interactions between predation risk from snakes and moonlight by conducting experiments near full and new moon nights. Both species of kangaroo rats preferred to forage in the Open and avoided the Bush. This preference is opposite to the preference of the main rodent-eating snake at the study site, the sidewinder (Crotalus cerastes), which prefers the Bush over the Open. At stations with snakes, D. deserti reduced its foraging and avoided the Bush more than in control plots. However, D. merriami foraged more at stations with snakes. D. merriami thus foraged at the trays that were avoided by D. deserti and it reduced the risk of interference from the dominant D. deserti. In contrast to studies by other investigators, moonlight (which is associated with increased risk from owls) did not reduce the foraging or affect the microhabitat use of kangaroo rats in summer; moonlight effect was seen only in the fall, when snakes were not active. Unlike risk from owls, risk from snakes is high under bushes and during dark nights. The activity of rodents in summer is a combined reaction to the different predation risks posed by snakes and by owls.

AB We analyze a simple model to show that spatial heterogeneity of zooplankton can explain discrepancies between the behavior of classical predator-prey models and the patterns observed in natural planktonic systems. We use a Lotka-Volterra type model of Daphnia and algae. Daphnia occupies only part of a total volume whereas the algae grow in the entire volume and diffuse between the two compartments. This simple spatial structure suffices to explain the observations that (1) natural Daphnia-algae systems tend to be relatively stable up to high nutrient values, and that (2) in the presence of Daphnia edible algae do increase with enrichment. Additionally, the model trivially explains confusing observations of oscillating Daphnia densities in the presence of a practically constant density of edible algae. The model is supported by the results of a laboratory experiment with a cascade of zooplankton-phytoplankton containers, devised originally to test ratio-dependent foraging. We derive minimalizations of our model, which no longer explicitly account for the spatial structure, but still preserve the essential behavior of the full model.

AB Field and laboratory studies were conducted during 1989-1994 to investigate the overwintering strategies of hatchling turtles representing four families native to western Nebraska. Whereas hatchling snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) and spiny soft-shelled turtles (Apalone spinifera) overwinter in aquatic habitats, yellow mud turtles (Kinosternon flavescens) and ornate box turtles (Terrapene ornata) burrow below the natal nest and hibernate in sandy soil. Painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) overwinter within their shallow natal nests, but this species, and T. ornata, tolerate extensive tissue freezing. Overwintering behaviors of these species are consistent with indices of physiological cold hardiness and patterns of geographic distribution. Frost commonly penetrated and persisted below 10 cm, the soil depth at which hatchling C. picta routinely hibernate. Field and laboratory data suggested that hatchling C, picta survive either by remaining supercooled (unfrozen) or by tolerating tissue freezing, the strategy employed depending on prevailing physiological and microenvironmental conditions. Whereas relatively lower temperatures can be survived in the supercooled state, supercooling capacity may be limited via the inoculation of body fluids by environmental ice. Alternatively, whereas freeze tolerance fortuitously is promoted by ice inoculation, this strategy may be viable only at relatively high subzero temperatures. A cold-hardiness strategy based on both survival mechanisms may promote winter survival in hatchling C. picta by conferring protection under dynamic physiological and microenvironmental conditions. Physiological cold hardiness and behavior are integrated determinants of the northern distributions of temperate region turtles,

AB Diameter, height, crown shape, and crown area were measured on 23-42 trees ranging in size from saplings to large adults for each of eight common dicotyledonous tree species in a neotropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, Six species were canopy trees, one species was an emergent tree, and the remaining species was an understory tree. Crown areas and shapes were quantified by eight radii measured every 45 degrees from the trunk to the vertically projected edge of the crown, Crown areas were calculated from the areas of circles with the average radius; crown shapes were measured by the coefficients of variation of the eight crown radii. Age-diameter relationships were estimated from diameter growth increments over an 8-yr period.
   Observed height-diameter relationships were compared to expectations based on the theories of elastic similarity, constant stress, and geometric similarity. Slopes of log-transformed height-diameter relationships differed from the theoretically expected value of 2/3 for elastic similarity in three of eight species; two canopy species had higher slopes, but not as high as the expected value of 1.0 for geometric similarity; one canopy species was shorter, but the slope was greater than the slope of 0.5 predicted by the constant stress theory, The theory of elastic similarity also predicts that canopy mass to trunk mass ratio should remain constant during tree growth, Observed ratios based on proxy variables for the masses were constant in six of eight species-the two deviant species had heavier crowns in large trees than expected from their diameters. Crown shapes were much more variable in some species than others. The understory species had much lower r(2) values for height-diameter and crown-diameter relationships, suggesting that these relationships may be more variable in trees that live in the less windy understory than in trees that reach the canopy.
   The allometric relationships for the species in this study were not unique for each species, suggesting that it may be possible to model the allometric relationships of many species with fewer equations than species. If the primary adaptive forces acting on tree species in a diverse forest are their physical environment and the sum of competitive interactions with an ever-changing mix of neighbors, then different species may have similar resource allocation patterns. Thus, using the age-size relationships, we found three groups of species among the seven canopy species, Two groups had three species each and one species (Ocotea whitei) was in a group by itself. The understory species, Faramea occidentalis, was also in a group by itself.

AB The niche concept is a central organizing aspect of modern ecology. Although its history has often been reviewed, the structure of the concept and its connection to advances in ecological theory has received less recent attention. I review the niche concept using ''mechanistic'' models of community theory to identify two distinct components. One describes the environmental requirements of organisms and the other describes the per capita impact of organisms on the environment. I argue that these correspond to significant differences between Grinnell's and Elton's concepts distinct from the previously discussed ''habitat'' vs. ''functional'' dichotomy. I illustrate the distinction between the requirement and impact components of the niche using models of resource competition and of keystone predators, and I discuss ''Gause's axiom'' and conventional ''niche theory'' in the context of these two distinct niche components. I suggest that the niche concept be elucidated by explicit reference to these two distinct components; the ''impact'' niche (corresponding to Elton's concept) describing instantaneous per-capita effects of species on the environment, and the ''requirement'' niche describing the response of species to the environment (corresponding to Hutchinson's definition). This approach connects conventional niche theory with ''mechanistic'' individual-based ecological models and can help provide a more modern context for the niche concept.

AB In forest gaps, the geometry of canopy openings above a plant determines the spatial distribution of diffuse and direct radiation, which may be received from different sectors of the sky. We examined crown orientation and light interception by seedlings of four species of pioneer trees, Cecropia obtusifolia, Heliocarpus appendiculatus, Piper auritum, and Trema micrantha, transplanted into natural forest gaps at the Los Tuxtlas Tropical Biology Station, Veracruz, Mexico. The four species differed in the number and mean size of leaves, but total leaf area was not significantly different among equal age plants. The mean azimuth and zenith angle of diffuse and direct radiation were determined from hemispherical photographs taken above each plant. Mean diffuse radiation vectors were distributed around the zenith, with a significant clustering in an easterly direction, while mean direct radiation vectors were distributed along the solar track in the southern portion of the sky. The mean orientation of the crown of each seedling was determined from detailed, three-dimensional reconstruction of leaf display using a canopy architecture model. A directional correlation test indicated that seedling crowns were oriented toward diffuse radiation received from the gap, and not toward direct radiation. The mean orientation of the crown, at the whole plant level, was primarily determined by nonrandom orientation of individual leaves. The mechanisms of this differential response to diffuse vs. direct radiation are not known. For diffuse radiation, the total light capture capacity integrated over all sky directions increased with seedling leaf area, while efficiency of capture per unit area decreased. Based on simulations, the light interception efficiency of each plant in its own microsite was 5-25% greater than would be achieved in the sites of conspecifics or in symmetric canopy openings centered on the zenith. These analyses provide a quantitative estimate of the value of nonrandom leaf and crown orientation for whole-plant light interception in natural environments.

AB Empirical studies of the spatial spread of insect pathogens have emphasized the importance of high dispersal rates, but typically rely strictly on observational data. In contrast, existing mathematical models on the spatial spread of infectious diseases have suggested that a highly infectious disease can spread rapidly even if the dispersal rate of its host is low; such models, however, are largely untested. To understand how host dispersal and disease infectiousness affect the spatial spread of infectious diseases, we performed a field experiment in which we released a nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) into two experimentally established, disease-free gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) populations. We simultaneously and independently measured the long-distance dispersal of ballooning, first-instar, gypsy moth larvae, the stage in which dispersal is by far the greatest. Surprisingly, dispersal by ballooning was a good predictor of NPV spread only in the first few weeks of spread. Subsequently, the virus spread much farther and less directionally than did ballooning larvae. No infections appeared in control plots that started with only uninfected larvae, confirming that the virus that we released caused the epizootic in our experimental populations. On the theory that the additional spread was due to a combination of small-scale larval dispersal and a high rate of disease transmission, we compared our data to the predictions of a mathematical model for the spatial spread of insect pathogens that combines disease transmission and small-scale host dispersal. By using independent estimates of each of the model parameters, we used the model to make post hoc predictions of the rate of spread of the virus from an initial distribution dictated by larval ballooning. Although the model included both initial long-distance dispersal by larval ballooning and subsequent short-distance dispersal by larval crawling, it poorly matched the observed distribution of the virus. An alternative and as yet untested hypothesis is that the observed spread of the virus may be due to mechanical vectoring by a parasitoid fly, a mechanism for which there are as yet no available mathematical theory or relevant field data.

AB According to the kin selection theory the degree of genetic relatedness affects the nature of intraspecific competition and it might promote cooperative and/or altruistic behavior between individuals. We examined kinship effects on reproductive success of territorial females and survival of juveniles in the bank voIe Clethrionomys glareolus. Four experimental populations were founded in large enclosures (0.5 ha): two consisted of five related (Related, R) and two of five mutually unrelated females (Unrelated, UR). Each population had five males of heterogeneous origin.
   Our earlier results showed that populations of the R grew twice as fast as the UR. Here we show that recruitment and offspring survival is connected to spacing behavior of mothers. Unrelated females who had their home ranges close to each other produced significantly fewer recruits than the related ones. Their home ranges overlapped significantly less and ranges were smaller if they were situated close to each other. Furthermore, the survival of juveniles declined with dispersal distance from the natal territory in populations of the UR. Trappabilities of juveniles were also lower among the young whose home ranges were close to unrelated females, indicating avoidance of mature females.
   Our results indicate that competition for space is more intense among unrelated neighbors, decreasing their reproductive success. Infanticide towards unrelated nestlings and/or juveniles is one possible mechanism decreasing survival and causing a lower recruitment of young. On the contrary, sharing of space among related neighbors did not seem to cause notable costs on their reproduction. Mature females allowed related young females to use their territory, but still, the young: did not acquire an area for their own reproduction, probably due to a mother-daughter conflict. The basic social structure of Clethrionomys populations, i.e., exclusive female territoriality, remained the same regardless of a high degree of relatedness.

AB Large grazing mammals contribute to the species diversity of grasslands via direct and indirect effects of defoliation and urine deposition. We examined the influence of one and two applications of simulated bovine urine on vegetation structure on (I) tallgrass prairie burned either every 2 or 4 yr at Konza Prairie Research Natural Area (KPRNA), Kansas, and (2) unburned sandhills prairie at the Niobrara Valley Preserve, Nebraska. We also examined the influence of urine and the clipping of graminoids on an annually burned site at KPRNA.
   Plant abundance in general increased on urine patches but the response appeared dependent on litter accumulation. C-4 grasses increased at the annual burn and Niobrara sites where litter levels were low. C-3 forbs increased at the 2- and 4-yr burn sites where litter levels were high. Urine treatment significantly affected community composition at all but the 2-yr burn site. Alpha-diversity decreased on urine patches at the annual and 4-yr burn sites but increased on urine patches at the Niobrara site. Beta-diversity increased on urine patches at the annual burn and Niobrara site but decreased on urine patches at the 4-yr burn site. The clipping of graminoids at the annual burn site reduced both alpha- and beta-diversity and graminoid abundance while forb abundance was not affected.

AB The effect of plant community structure on nutrient cycling is fundamental to our understanding of ecosystem function. We examined the importance of plant species and plant cover (i.e., plant covered microsites vs. bare soil) on nutrient cycling in shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado. We tested the effects of both plant species and cover on soils in an area of undisturbed shortgrass steppe and an area that had undergone nitrogen and water additions from 1971 to 1974, resulting in significant shifts in plant species composition.
   Soils under plants had consistently higher C and N mineralization rates and, in some cases, higher total and microbial C and N levels than soils without plant cover. Four native grasses, one sedge, and one shrub differed from one another in the quantity and quality of above- and belowground biomass but differences among the six species in soil nutrient cycling under their canopies were slight. However, soils under bunchgrasses tended to have higher C mineralization and microbial biomass C than soil under the rhizomatous grass, Agropyron smithii. Also, the one introduced annual in the study, Kochia scoparia, had soils with less plant-induced heterogeneity and higher rates of C and N mineralization as well as higher levels of microbial biomass C than soils associated with the other species. This species was abundant only on plots that had received water and nitrogen for a 4-yr period that ended 20 yr ago, where it has persisted in the absence of resource additions for 20 yr, suggesting a positive feedback between plant persistence and soil nutrient status.
   Plant cover patterns had larger effects on ecosystem scale estimates of soil properties than the attributes of a particular plant species. This result may be due to the semiarid nature of this grassland in which plant cover is discontinuous and decomposition and nutrient availability are primarily limited by water, not by plant species-mediated characteristics such as litter quality. That local plant-induced patterns in soil properties significantly affected ecosystem scale estimates of these properties indicates that consideration of structural attributes, particularly plant cover patterns, is critical to estimates of ecosystem function in shortgrass steppe.

AB In this paper we sought to answer questions related to the long-term soil water dynamics of the Patagonian steppe: What are the magnitude and seasonal dynamics of transpiration, evaporation, and deep percolation? How do these fluxes respond to fluctuations in annual precipitation? What is the pattern of soil water availability? We developed a soil water model for the steppe with a daily time step. The model gives weekly cumulative values of transpiration, evaporation, and drainage, maximum and minimum water content for the different soil layers in each week, and the weekly frequency of days with soil water potential higher than -1 MPa for each layer. The model was tested against three sets of experimental data. Simulated data of total water losses were significantly correlated with observed data, and the slope did not differ significantly from 1 nor the y-intercept from 0.
   On a long term basis, evaporation accounted for 56% of total water loss, transpiration 34%, and deep percolation the remaining 10%. Transpiration and evaporation had asynchronic dynamics. Evaporation was high during the coldest and wettest months of the year (mainly winter months). Transpiration, on the contrary, reached maximum values when energy and water availability were simultaneously high in late spring-early summer. Drainage took place during the coldest months, when most of precipitation occurred, and the soil remained near field capacity.
   Both evaporation and transpiration had a positive response to an increase in precipitation. However, the proportion of total water loss following these pathways decreased with increasing precipitation. Drainage had a positive exponential relationship with winter precipitation. Probabilities of soil water potential higher than -1 MPa in the upper soil layer were very low during most of the warm season (P < 0.15). At the beginning of the growing season the wettest layer was located at an intermediate depth (10-20 and 20-40 cm), and moved downward so at the end, only deep roots had high soil water availability.

AB Stocking of the dominant planktivore of Castle Lake (rainbow trout) was discontinued to examine the impact of food web interactions on zooplankton communities and inter- and intra-annual dynamics of ecosystem properties (light penetration, primary productivity). Dynamics of zooplankton and ecosystem processes were examined for 3 yr following the manipulation and compared to 2-3 yr of premanipulation data. Sampling of vertebrate and invertebrate planktivores documented shifts in other members of the zooplanktivore guild as rainbow trout declined. Reduction of rainbow trout densities led to compensatory responses in other components of the Castle Lake fish assemblage as brook trout and golden shiners increased in abundance. This compensation resulted in increased rates of vertebrate planktivory on daphnids within 2 yr after trout stocking was discontinued. Zooplankton shifts in response to discontinuance of trout stocking were more rapid, particularly an immediate increase in a previously rare invertebrate predator (Diacyclops thomasi). Other limnological parameters also responded rapidly following the manipulation: water transparency declined and primary productivity (PPr) increased. In addition, intra-annual patterns (i.e., seasonal development) and the vertical distribution (shallow vs. deep) of PPr appeared to be affected by the food web manipulation. Our results indicate that complexities of real food webs complicate the prediction of the outcome of food web perturbations. Reduction of the previously dominant planktivore (rainbow trout) led to increases in other zooplanktivores (Diacyclops, golden shiners, brook trout) that resulted in enhanced predation pressure on zooplankton herbivores. Our results also indicate that alterations in water quality parameters (transparency, PPr) in response to food web alterations need not necessarily be mediated through changes in the abundance of Daphnia, as strong limnological responses preceded reductions in Daphnia by a year. We hypothesize an alternative mechanism for food-web-induced changes in lake ecosystem dynamics: changes in water clarity and productivity can result when cyclopoid predation strongly affects micrograzers.

AB Matrix projections allow identification of those phases in the life cycle with a high potential impact on the population growth rate. This impact is assessed by the sensitivity or elasticity of the matrix elements that are computed from life cycle data such as age-dependent survival or fecundity. Covariation among life cycle components, e.g., due to trade-offs, is a main subject of life history theory. Sensitivities or elasticities of matrix elements do not take this covariation into account. Integrated sensitivities and elasticities measure the net effect of a matrix element, combining its direct effect and indirect effects through correlation with other matrix elements. These measures are related to the selection differentials and expected selection responses from quantitative genetics. The use of these measures is illustrated with data on disease resistance in a perennial weed Plantago lanceolata, and the demography of killer whale pods.

AB Marine larvae are consumed by a wide variety of generalist fishes and particle-feeding invertebrates, but larvae of any particular species probably constitute a small and variable portion of the diet for these consumers. Because virtually all consumers can ingest small quantities of noxious compounds with minimal detrimental effects, it is uncertain that toxic chemicals in larvae could be consumed in quantities sufficient to select for predator recognition and avoidance. Despite this, chemically defended larvae do occur. We show that, at low doses, secondary metabolites (the didemnins) from adults and larvae of the Caribbean tunicate Trididemnum solidum induced vomiting in fish, resulting in rapid learned aversion to the didemnin-defended food. The particle-feeding anemone Aiptasin pallida did not learn to avoid the chemically defended food. When anemones ingested the chemical equivalent of 15 larvae/d, representing <2% of the mass of their total daily diet, the didemnins in the ''larvae'' significantly reduced: (1) growth of adults by 82%, (2) combined growth of adults and daughter clones by 76%, (3) production of daughter clones by 44%, and (4) average mass of individual daughter clones by 41%. At higher water temperatures, anemones cloned more rapidly, but the negative effects of consuming didemnins also occurred more rapidly. Significant differences in the number of daughter clones produced between treatment and control anemones occurred after only 4 d at seawater temperatures of 27 degrees-29 degrees C vs. 32 d at seawater temperatures of 18 degrees-21 degrees C. Thus consumption of even very small quantities of secondary metabolites can decrease consumer fitness substantially and select for predators that recognize and avoid chemically defended larvae, as do many consumers that co-occur with Trididemnum solidum larvae. This is the first rigorous demonstration that consumption of marine secondary metabolites can decrease consumer fitness when ingested at ecologically realistic doses.

AB Individual trees in a North Florida population of Quercus geminata, (sand live oak) vary widely in rates of herbivory by a leaf-mining moth (Stilbosis quadricustatella). Some oaks are always heavily infested while neighboring trees remain lightly attacked. We conducted field experiments in 1991 and 1992 to determine if leafminer performance on heavily and lightly attacked trees contributed to this pattern. We also compared the leaf production phenology, leaf area, and stem length of heavily and lightly attacked trees to determine if tree phenotypic traits influenced herbivory. Our results indicate that: (I) Lightly attacked trees produced leaves earlier in the spring than heavily attacked trees, and the difference among trees in leaf production phenology explained 61% of the variation in leafminer densities (P = 0.008). (2) Lightly attacked trees produced significantly smaller leaves than heavily attacked trees, but leaf size explained only 13% of the variation in herbivory (P = 0.048). (3) There were no differences in larval performance on heavily and lightly attacked trees in either 1991 or 1992, with the exception of egg mortality, which was significantly higher on lightly attacked trees in 1991 (P = 0.04). (4) Host plants caused greater leafminer mortality than natural enemies, but neither differed significantly between heavily and lightly attacked trees.
   Our transfer experiments and observations of wild leafminers revealed little difference in leafminer performance on heavily and lightly attacked Quercus geminata trees. However, tree phenotypic traits differed, especially the timing of spring foliation, which occurred significantly earlier among trees with low rates of herbivory. These results suggest that leafminer ovipositional preference, rather than performance, could be an important determinant of differential herbivory. There may be an unknown selective advantage to preferential oviposition on trees with delayed spring leaf production.

AB We studied the patterns and mechanisms of regeneration of a 400-ha windthrown in an old-growth beech-hemlock forest caused by a tornado on 31 May 1985. Starting in 1986, and over a period of six growing seasons, we recorded percent cover and density of woody stems, and monitored seedling demography of nearly 5000 seedlings in the windthrow and adjacent forest.
   Plant community response to the disturbance was dramatic: by August of 1986, species richness, tree seedling density and total percent cover were significantly greater in the windthrow than in the adjacent forest. Shade-intolerant herbs (e.g., Erechtites hieracifolia) and shrubs (e.g., Rubus allegheniensis) established and rapidly increased in abundance during the first 3 yr, but began declining by the 5th yr of the study. Tree seedlings established in decreasing amounts through the 6 yr of the study, and the young tree canopy was dominated in 1991 by seedlings and sprouts that established prior to 1987.
   Fagus grandifolia, a shade-tolerant species that established via advanced regeneration, was dominant the first 3 yr, but was surpassed in the 5th yr by Betula alleghaniensis, a species of intermediate tolerance that established from seed germination just before or shortly after the disturbance. Tsuga canadensis seedling densities were initially high, but deer browsing prevented substantial growth and a drought in 1988 caused heavy mortality of browsed seedlings. Regeneration thus differed from the predictions of the gap and Hubbard Brook models of forest regeneration (which predict dominance by shade-intolerant species), and the severity model (which predicts dominance by shade-tolerant species). The differences point out important influences of availability of propagules and the impact of herbivory; and the need for more attention to models that incorporate multiple contingencies.

AB Despite the blossoming interest in host-microparasite epidemiology, and in use of viruses in the biological control of insect pests, few empirical studies have attempted to quantify transmission and mortality rates under field conditions. We report a laboratory and field study in which the transmission parameter (nu) and mortality rate (alpha) due to nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) are measured in different larval instars of the cabbage moth, Mamestra brassicae (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Laboratory studies of food consumption and virus susceptibility were used to produce crude estimates of relative transmission rates in successive instars. Increases in the rate of feeding outstrip increases in virus resistance with instar, so we predict that transmission rates should increase in older larvae (assuming rate of intake of virus to be proportional to rate of feeding). This prediction was tested in a field experiment in which a constant initial density of susceptible and infected (moribund) larvae were reared together on cabbage plants for 2-8 d. Estimates of the linear transmission parameter (nu) did not differ between instars and gave a mean value of 2.16 x 10(-12) for all instars and time points. Causes for the discrepancy between predictions based on laboratory data and field measurements are discussed. Differences were found between instars in the time from infection to death (tau) (equivalent to 1/alpha, where alpha is the rate of mortality due to viral infection). Second-instar larvae died more rapidly once infected than third instars, which, in turn, died more rapidly than fourth instars. The effect of host population stage structure on patterns of viral infection can be pronounced and if recognized, may significantly increase the accuracy and predictive value of models of host pathogen systems.

AB Factorial manipulations of the abundance of two predator species (presence or absence of six adult Notophthalmus viridescens, and/or six larval Ambystoma opacum per pond) and a guild of three prey species (larvae of Pseudacris crucifer, Bufo woodhousii fowleri, and Hyla andersonii) tested the equivalence, additivity, and dependence on initial prey density of predation by both predator species in 1-m(3) artificial ponds. The two predators were functionally equivalent, eliminating Bufo and Hyla, while leaving Pseudacris to numerically dominate ponds with salamanders. Effects of both predators also cascaded down to algal primary producers, which became more abundant where predators reduced the abundance of herbivorous tadpoles. Combined impacts of the two predator species on the survival of Pseudacris were less than that predicted by an additive model of the effects of each predator measured in the absence of the other, but greater than predicted by a multiplicative model of joint predator effects. Reduced growth of Ambystoma with Notophthalmus provides one possible mechanism for the observed shift to less than additive per capita predator effects. Initial variation in prey density influenced prey species composition only in ponds without predators. Increased prey density in ponds without predators reduced the survival of Hyla, apparently through increased interspecific competition among tadpoles.

AB We investigated relationships between body condition (body mass scaled by body size) early in the breeding season and reproductive performance of three seabird species showing various life history traits. The study was conducted at Kerguelen Island from 1987 to 1994 on the Blue Petrel (Halobaena caerulea, an oceanic feeder), the Thin-billed Prion (Pachyptila belcheri, a neritic feeder), and the Common Diving Petrel (Pelecanoides up urinatrix, a coastal feeder). Breeding success was highly variable among years in the three species, but the proportion of nonbreeding experienced breeders varied significantly only in the Blue Petrel. In the three species, body condition showed considerable year-to-year variation, suggesting substantial fluctuation in the availability of prey early in the breeding season. Relationships between early body condition and reproductive performance differed among the species. Reproductive success was significantly influenced by early condition in the Blue Petrel but not in the Thin-billed Prion and the Common Diving Petrel. In the long-lived Blue Petrel, depletion of body condition early in the breeding season resulted in a high proportion of nonbreeders and massive egg desertion. On the other hand, the shorter lived Thin-billed Prion and Common Diving Petrel seemed to respond by maintaining their reproductive output during poor years, probably investing more in the reproductive episode. Such contrasted patterns are analyzed in the light of reproductive effort and optimal clutch size theory.

AB Variation in pollinator composition at the individual plant level is an important prerequisite for plant specialization on pollinators that does not seem to have been investigated previously. I studied variation in pollinator composition in a southeastern Spanish population of the insect-pollinated shrub lavandula latifolia (Labiatae) and examined its correlates, with particular reference to the distinction between factors intrinsic (flower morphology, nectar standing crop, size of floral display) and extrinsic (sunlight regime, ambient temperature, humidity) to the plants. L. latifolia shrubs differed significantly in all intrinsic variables measured, in average irradiance levels (due to site-dependent variation in timing and duration of insolation periods), and in pollinator composition at both the species and order levels. Individual variation in pollinator composition was largely due to differences among insect taxa in their foraging responses to the sunlight mosaic. While some pollinators foraged indiscriminately over that mosaic, others preferred sites characterized by high irradiance. Variation among plants in intrinsic variables wan unrelated differences in pollinator composition, which depended significantly only on the sunlight regime associated with each plant's location in the habitat. Site-specific effects in pollination will generally act to reduce the likelihood of selective pressures by animals on plant traits. Their importance should be greatest in habitats characterized by patchiness in environmental variables that affect pollinator behavior and in plants with pollinator assemblages dominated by ectothermic species.

AB Females of dioecious plant species are expected to show greater trade-offs with other life history traits than males because of their high investment in reproduction. We investigated life history traits and resource allocation patterns for both males and females of the dioecious plant Silene latifolia, to document allocation both prior to and after reproductive investment. In addition, the impact of fruit production on subsequent allocation to reproduction and growth was investigated hv varying the number nf flowers pollinated females. The mean date of first reproduction was the same for males and females. Early-flowering plants of both sexes invested less in leaf biomass than plants that delayed flowering. The percentage of flowers pollinated had a significant effect on how resources were allocated, and on the amount and timing of further flower production. Sexual dimorphism was observed in resource allocation patterns after, but not prior to, investment in reproduction. Overall, pollinated females were found to have more leaf biomass and invest nearly twice as much in reproduction as males, in spite of an apparent trade-off between leaf production and reproduction within both females and males. We conclude that sexual dimorphism in life history traits that affects resource acquisition causes the resource pool that is allocated to be variable, rather than static, thereby masking the underlying tradeoffs.

   ADVANTAGE
AB Polistes wasps can initiate colonies by themselves, but spring foundresses often cooperate in constructing a shared nest and raising a common brood. The relative benefits for such cooperation vary across environmental and social contexts and thus foundresses should shift reproductive strategies when contexts change. An experimental study of 10 field populations of P. dominulus provides evidence for such strategy shifts. P. dominulus females displayed three basic alternative reproductive strategies: initiate a nest alone or as a dominant on a multifoundress nest, join as a subordinate, or refrain from nesting and instead ''sit-and-wait'' for reproductive opportunities to open later in the season. In our populations, joining likely yields inclusive fitness benefits by increasing colony survival and resistance to usurpation. Nevertheless, joiners and other foundresses readily moved to improve their situations by (1) adopting orphaned nests. (2) switching to larger nests, and (3) usurping small nests, which may have had a weakened foundress or a foundress with relatively low motivation for nest defense. Joining occurring more often early in the season, and adopting and usurping occurring more often later were consistent with inclusive fitness maximization. Lost past investments in nests did not affect future decisions. Overall, residents of nests were larger than the wasps that joined them, but this difference decreased over the course of the season. Wasps that had cooperated in the past to form multifoundress associations were more likely to renest (usually together) after removal of their original nest than were single foundresses. After nest loss, single foundresses were more likely than multiple foundresses to take over another wasp's nest by adoption or usurpation.
   Cooperation within multifoundress associations is facultative and the balance between cooperation and conflict theoretically depends on the asymmetry in reproduction resulting from the asymmetry in dominance. P. dominulus cofoundresses closer in size (less asymmetrical in dominance) added cells to their nests more slowly and produced significantly smaller nests and fewer workers than associations with more size variation, as would be predicted by greater conflict between wasps that are closer in size. The decline in size differences between joining wasps and residents suggests that late-season joiners were relatively large wasps seeking to dominate residents. Conflict on the nest may also explain why multiple foundresses disappeared from nests at a higher rate than did single foundresses. In sum, the multiple reproductive options of P. dominulus lead to a dynamic and flexible balance between cooperation and conflict in their social interactions.

AB In an experimental test of plant community invasibility, we introduced seeds of a native ruderal, California poppy (Eschscholzia californica), at fixed density into experimental plots in a California winter annual grassland. Each of the 42 plots, which ranged in size from 2 m(2) to 32 m(2), had been studied for 4 yr previous to the introduction, with the common observation that a subset of plots of each size consistently held more species than others. It was primarily in these more species-rich plots that establishment and reproduction by the experimental invader occurred. Success of the invader per plot. measured as the total number of plants germinating, producing seeds, or perennating, varied with plot size, but the statistical contribution of plot size was secondary to that of local species number. Contributing variables were the extent of small mammal disturbance (positive) and the degree to which a single resident plant species (in particular, Bromus diandrus) dominated a plot (negative). In contrast to theories of competitive exclusion via niche partitioning, species-rich plots were more invasible.

AB The angiosperm flora of the Hawaiian Islands, with its high incidence of dioecy, has been central in development of hypotheses about the evolution of dioecy. Based on a recent taxonomic treatment of the Hawaiian angiosperm flora, we analyzed biogeographic patterns of dioecy as well as the association of dioecy with ecological traits potentially important in the evolution of dioecy for native current species and genera. We also analyzed patterns for presumed colonists of the flora to control better for phylogenetic patterns in these traits. Dioecy is associated with woodiness, especially trees; however, this pattern does not hold for gynodioecy. Within woody species, dimorphism (dioecy, gynodioecy, subdioecy, polygamodioecy) is associated with mesic habitats and occurs more frequently in species with lowland and lowland-montane distributions. In contrast, in the endemic Hawaiian Alsinoideae (Schiedea and Alsinidendron) and in Bidens (two groups with autochthonous evolution of dimorphism), dimorphism is associated with more xeric habitats, and for the former group, with wind pollination. For the entire angiosperm flora, dimorphic species are associated with flowers that are small and green. Woody dioecious species and genera are disproportionately associated with wind pollination; hermaphroditic species are disproportionately bird pollinated primarily because of one species-rich lineage in the Campanulaceae. There was no association of dimorphism and pollinator type for colonists. Because of a few species-rich lineages, dimorphism is associated with dry fruits at the specific level, but at the generic level and for colonists, dimorphism is associated with fleshy fruits.
   Dioecious and gynodioecious species are found more often on older islands, a result of speciation of dimorphic colonists as well as autochthonous evolution of dimorphism. Single-island endemism is not associated with dioecy in the flora as a whole or with dimorphism within lineages evolving dimorphism autochthonously; thus Baker's law is not supported within the Hawaiian Islands. Because the Hawaiian angiosperm flora originated from a minimum of only 291 colonists, many of the associations of dimorphism with ecological traits occur because of the influence of only a few species-rich lineages. Better knowledge of phylogenetic patterns and further ecological studies, particularly within those groups evolving dioecy autochthonously, are needed to determine causality.

AB This study quantifies the effects of low-intensity logging (affecting <10% of the forest surface) on leaf chemistry, leaf and fruit production, and their effects on lemurs in a dry deciduous forest in western Madagascar. Logging exposed the remaining trees to more sunlight. Within a single tree and among trees, this resulted in higher protein concentrations in sun-exposed leaves, while fiber content remained constant. Concentrations of condensed tannins were also higher at higher sun exposure, but they leveled off at lower light intensities before protein and sugar concentrations. Within the 2-yr study period, crown extension due to higher availability of sunlight could compensate only for parts of the crown area lost due to logging. Thus, the biomass of leaves available was reduced, while average leaf quality (measured as the ratio of protein to fiber) increased.
   Fruit production was also positively correlated with sun exposure of the tree crown. Since fruits of the main timber trees (Commiphora spp.) are rarely consumed by frugivorous lemurs, removal of these trees increases sun exposure of other potential food trees for frugivores.
   At the described level of logging intensity, sightings of all lemur species increased (significantly in three out of seven species at P less than or equal to 0.05) compared to the pre-logging state and two control plots. This increase was attributed to increased fruit production and higher protein concentration in sun-exposed leaves.
   In natural forests, treefall gaps may have effects similar to those of logging in the present study. Low level disturbances, in general, may be important for the carrying capacity for folivorous and frugivorous lemurs and possibly for most primates.

AB In predator-prey interactions between size-structured populations, small (young) predators may compete with species that ultimately become their prey. We tested experimentally whether such competition occurs between young-of-year (YOY) largemouth bass and their eventual prey, bluegill. In a divided experimental pond, target densities of YOY bass and juvenile bluegill were subjected to different densities of bass and bluegill neighbors to examine the dependence of juvenile growth on fish density and species composition. After 7 wk, clear differences in growth rates of both species existed across densities, Bass growth was reduced in the presence of both bass and bluegill neighbors, whereas bluegill growth was primarily affected intraspecifically. Bluegill had strong competitive effects on bass despite substantial resource partitioning between the two species. These effects were mediated through changes in the size-structure of important invertebrate prey in both open water and vegetation habitats. Data collected from a set of seven lakes in Michigan indicate that interspecific competition between juvenile bluegill and YOY bass is an important process in natural populations, However, once bass become piscivorous, bluegill become a significant resource for bass. As a result, bass populations are split into two functionally distinct stages that respond differently across a gradient of bluegill density. Because of the competitive stage between predator and prey, dynamics of the interaction differ from predictions based on classical predator-prey or competition theory.

AB We used the eddy covariance technique to measure exchanges of water vapor, energy, and CO2 between California serpentine grassland and the atmosphere. Even though the system was built around an inexpensive, one-dimensional sonic anemometer and a closed-path CO2 analyzer, energy balance closure was accurate to +/-20% at a net radiation of 500 W/m(2), and the spectra and cospectra indicated only modest information loss from incompletely resolved high-frequency turbulence.
   In the early and middle parts of the growing season, net radiation, latent heat, and sensible heat all had similar diurnal dynamics, with latent heat accounting for approximate to 60% of the net radiation. Late in the growing season, energy dissipation by latent heat dropped dramatically, even though the vapor pressure gradient remained high.
   The Omega factor, an index of the role of canopy conductance in regulating transpiration (Jarvis and McNaughton 1986), decreased from 0.8 early in the growing season (indicating predominant control of transpiration by net radiation) to 0.1 late in the growing season (indicating a shift to control of transpiration by canopy conductance and vapor pressure deficit). Canopy conductance was a linear function of the product of net photosynthesis and relative humidity, divided by the CO2 concentration, as predicted by Ball (1988). The slope of the relationship, however, was greater early in the growing season than at other times.
   Whole-ecosystem carbon exchange rates were modest, with midday net photosynthesis reaching maximum values of 6-8 mu mol . m(-2). s(-1) in early April. Diurnal variation in photosynthesis roughly paralleled variation in photosynthetically active photon flux density (PFD), but with the daily maximum increasing with canopy development early in the growing season and decreasing with drought at the end of the growing season. Photosynthesis did not clearly saturate at high levels of PFD. Ecosystem dark respiration increased strongly (Q(10) = 4.6) with increasing soil surface temperature.
   The efficiency with which absorbed radiation was used in ecosystem photosynthesis, integrated over entire days, was 0.0115 +/- 0.0015 mol CO2/mol PFD (approximate to 20% of the values measured for healthy, single leaves under low light conditions) until late in the growing season, when the efficiency fell sharply. Using simple assumptions to extrapolate measurements from 11 d to the entire growing season, we estimate ecosystem annual gross primary production to be 11.1 mol CO2/m(2), yielding an annual net primary production of approximate to 133 g biomass/m(2). This is near the center of the range of published values from aboveground harvest studies.

AB The costs of reproduction in Kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla were studied from 1990 to 1993 on Hornoy in northern Norway by enlarging and decreasing brood sizes of two chicks to three and one during the first week after hatching. No parents were able to raise the enlarged broods of three to fledging. Most chick mortality occurred in the 19-22 d age group. Chick body mass and fledging success were lower among enlarged broods than among reduced and control broods. Body mass of females, but not males, was lower at the end of the chick-rearing period in enlarged broods. Only those females rearing enlarged broods experienced a higher mortality during the next breeding season. Our results support Lack's hypothesis of clutch size regulation: Kittiwakes laid the maximal number of eggs they were able to raise successfully to hedging. Furthermore, as female Kittiwake mortality increased when clutches were enlarged, females have a trade-off between investment in current reproduction and investment in future reproduction. Because males and females responded differently to brood enlargement, fitness estimates showed that Kittiwakes may have a sex-specific optimal clutch size.

AB Variation in relative competitive abilities among environments has been proposed to control the species composition of plant communities. We tested whether the competitive responses of eight species varied with fertility and disturbance in an old field. We also tested whether the competitive effects of vegetation varied with fertility and disturbance. Plots received one of four combinations of nitrogen (added or not) and disturbance (tilled or not) in each of five years. There were 10 replicates of each treatment. In the fifth summer, transplants of eight species comprising annual and perennial forbs and grasses were grown in all four combinations of the N and disturbance treatments. Transplants were grown in subplots with all neighbors, with only roots of neighbors, or with no neighbors. Transplant roots and shoots were harvested after one summer and individual growth rates were determined. Growth rate varied significantly with the interaction among species, competition, and N, suggesting that species differed in their competitive responses and that these differences varied with N availability. Comparisons among competition treatments at each level of N showed six distinct responses in the eight species examined. The competitive effect of neighboring vegetation shifted from roots to shoots as N increased, but decreased in disturbed plots. The total effect of competition increased significantly with neighbor mass in 4 of the 32 cases examined (eight species in four combinations of N and disturbance). All four cases involved annuals in annual neighborhoods. The results for eight species confirmed earlier single-species experiments, and showed that the eight species diverged in their responses to competition as soil N availability varied.

AB The hypothesis that fitness following dispersal from the natal host increases with body size was tested under field conditions in the egg parasitoid Trichogramma pretiosum. In one experiment, size distributions of males and females at emergence were compared to those of males successful in locating mates and females successful in locating hosts. Mate and host location success increased with size in smaller parasitoids but were constant with respect to size in larger parasitoids. Selection intensities were 3.5-5.4 times greater in males than females, possibly reflecting the small contribution of postdispersal to total male fitness in this partially sibmating species. In a second experiment using field releases of genetically marked lines, the number of trap hosts parasitized by ''large'' females reared from Helicoverpa zea eggs and ''small'' females reared from Sitotroga cerealella eggs was compared. Large females parasitized more hosts than small females in one trial bur the reverse was observed in a second trial. Acceptance and suitability of the trap host species were not influenced by marker line or rearing host. We hypothesize that a genotype-environment interaction based on host age, host species, and wasp genotype accounts for the heterogenous results of the second experiment.
   Our main conclusion is that average postdispersal fitness of adult T. pretiosum increases with size in smaller wasps and is constant with respect to size in larger wasps. Contrary to general expectation, average wasp fitness does not increase linearly with size. Most importantly, wasp size is not a reliable predictor of individual or average cohort fitness; consistent size-fitness relationships emerge only when fitness is averaged over many genotypes and environments. Systematic factors such as host age and wasp genotype can have a strong influence on wasp fitness without strongly affecting size. The implications of these results for progeny and sex allocation in Trichogramma and for the mass production of parasitoids in biological control programs ale discussed.

AB The tropical and subtropical estuarine fish Rivulus marmoratus is known for its synchronous, self-fertilizing hermaphroditism. It matures within 3 mo and can produce eggs throughout the year These features would allow a particular strain to quickly colonize refuge such as crab holes in the high intertidal zone habitat. However, a high strain diversity has been found in the field. In order to explain this observation, we examined the phenotypic responses of R. marmoratus to variation in biotic and abiotic environmental factors over two consecutive generations and employed a modified Euler-Lotka equation to estimate and compare the net reproductive rate, R, among strains. We included five strains of R. marmoratus and manipulated levels of temperature, salinity, and food for the parental generation and levels of food only for the second generation. Low temperature (19 degrees C) inhibited sexual maturity, precluding any egg production during the entire 6-mo study. For individuals kept at high temperature (26 degrees C), salinity and food had an interactive effect on time to maturity, body size at maturity, and number of eggs produced. Using multivariate analysis of variance, we found a significant two-way interactive effect (food levels for the parental and the second generations) on the five reproductive traits studied in the second generation. When each trait was analyzed separately, we found significant three-way interactions for time to maturity and total length at maturity.
   We found that the fitness values for each strain varied in different environmental combinations (3 salinities x 3 incubation salinities for eggs x 2 food levels). However, four of five strains had similar overall fitness. Despite a lack of generic variation within each strain, X. marmoratus demonstrates considerable phenotypic variation in response to environmental changes. This feature and genetic variation among strains may explain how this species can survive and even prosper in an extremely variable and stressful environment.

AB The mutualistic mycorrhizal symbionts of plants have shown mixed responses to herbivory; they either decrease, increase, or show no measurable change. We examined the ectomycorrhizal responses of pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) exposed to I yr of simulated herbivory in two environments, one stressful and one less so. We also compared levels of ectomycorrhizal colonization and conelet production in pinyons from which an important insect herbivore had been removed for either 1 or 10 yr. Pinyons that grew in more stressful cinder soils experienced significant reductions (19%) in ectomycorrhizal colonization following 1 yr of simulated herbivory while pinyons growing in less stressful sandy loam soils did not. These results indicate that the degree of environmental stress experienced by a plant could affect whether mycorrhizal reductions result from herbivory. In addition the reductions in ectomycorrhizal colonization that resulted from chronic herbivory remained for a full year following herbivore removal even though conelet production increased 250-fold in the same time period. Our findings regarding the role of environmental stress and duration of herbivory in affecting mycorrhizal responses may help explain the variable responses found in other systems.

AB The classic account of primary succession inferred from a 220-yr glacial retreat chronosequence at Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska was compared to reconstructions of stand development based on tree-ring records from 850 trees at 10 sites of different age. The three oldest sites (deglaciated prior to 1840) differ from all younger sites in the early recruitment of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), the presence of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), and the inferred importance of early shrub thickets. The nitrogen-fixing shrub Sitka alder (Alnus sinuata) has been an important and long-lived species only at sites deglaciated since 1840. Black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) has been an overstory dominant only at sites deglaciated since 1900. These single-species additions or replacements distinguish three pathways of vegetation compositional change which are segregated spatially and temporally. The communities of different age at Glacier Bay do not constitute a single chronosequence and should nut be used uncritically to infer long-term successional trends.
   Among-site differences in texture and lithology of soil parent, material cannot account for the multiple pathways. However, distance from each study site to the closest seed source of Sitka spruce at the time of deglaciation explains up to 58% of the among-site variance in early spruce recruitment. Multiple pathways of compositional change at Glacier Bay appear to be a function of landscape context, which, in conjunction with species life history trails (dispersal capability and generation time), affects seed rain to newly deglaciated surfaces and thereby alters the arrival sequence of species. Differences among the pathways probably include long-term differences in ecosystem function resulting from substantial accumulation of nitrogen at sites where nitrogen-fixing shrubs are important.

AB Statistical analyses are based on a mixture of mathematical theorems and judgments based on subject matter knowledge, intuition, and the goals of the investigator. Review articles and textbooks, aiming for brevity and simplicity, sometimes blur the difference between mathematics and judgment. A folklore can develop, where judgments based on opinions become laws of what ''should'' be done. This can intimidate authors and readers, waste their time, and sometimes lead to analyses that obscure the information in the data rather than clarify it. Three familiar examples are discussed: the choice between Normal-based and non-parametric methods, the use of multiple-comparison procedures, and the choice of sums of squares for main effects in unbalanced ANOVA. In each case, commonly obeyed rules are shown to be judgments with which it is reasonable to disagree. A greater stress on model selection, aided by informal methods, such as plots, and by informal use of formal methods, such as tests, is advocated.

AB Conflict between ratio-dependent and prey-dependent views of trophic interactions finds its simplest resolution in the comparison of steady-state responses of trophic chains to increases in primary productivity. We analyze data on trophic abundances of lake ecosystems with a general trophic-chain model that is intermediate between prey dependence and ratio dependence, and can describe either of the two extremes, depending on parameter values. We estimate, for all trophic levels, the set of interference coefficients that predicts the observed statistical relationship between biomasses of adjacent trophic levels. This constitutes a test of two competing theories, since the model we use is a prey-dependent model if all interference coefficients are approximate to 0, and a ratio-dependent model if they are approximate to 1. The results show that the observed relationships among trophic levels in lake ecosystems are compatible with a ratio-dependent parameterization of this model, with interference distributed relatively evenly across trophic chains, and are incompatible with a pure prey-dependent parameterization. We suggest that approximate ratio dependence applied uniformly across trophic chains is a more plausible description of lake ecosystems than either pure prey dependence (non-interference) or ''concentrated interference'' (prey dependence at some trophic levels and partial interference in others).

AB Spatial dominance is maintained by the balance of three processes: mortality, recruitment, and growth. Patches of mussels facing high rates of mortality may show no change in percent cover (i.e., dominance) as long as growth by the remaining survivors can fill in the vacant space. A graphical model is developed to examine the possibility that growth may ameliorate the effects of predation and physical disturbance on spatial dominance. In the model, growth, mortality, and recruitment are depicted as Vectors on a set of isoclines for log percent cover. The 100% isocline is analogous to the self-thinning line. Self-thinning data for the mussel Mytilus edulis are used to establish the log-percent isoclines. A review of published growth and mortality data suggests mussels can use growth to offset the effects of mortality. Small mussels can easily double in length in 1 yr, and this is sufficient to withstand 60% mortality per year without a loss in percent cover. Since both growth and mortality tend to be size specific, the point at which growth can no longer offset mortality depends on the environmental conditions that affect rates of growth and mortality. The model and analysis can be easily extended to other species and suggest that species with rapid growth and large variation in body size need not rely on recruitment to maintain spatial dominance, even when faced with high rates of predation.

AB Variation in resource abundance affects population dynamics by altering demographic processes and interactions among individuals in the population. For small mammals, food is likely to be a critical resource. Population densities should vary directly with food abundance, but the underlying demographic changes are more difficult to predict. We experimentally increased food available to populations of hispid cotton rats, Sigmodon hispidus, to examine how rates of recruitment and disappearance varied with food abundance. We expected supplemental food to increase winter survival and to increase recruitment, perhaps advancing the date of first reproduction in the spring. We also thought larger behaviorally dominant animals might dominate the point sources of supplemental food, altering age or size ratios and producing an excess of transient animals.
   Supplemental food increased population densities but did not dampen pronounced seasonal fluctuations. Supplemented populations contained proportionately more juveniles and small adults than did controls; social behavior may have limited increases in numbers of large adults. Survival rates did not change; density increases were due to increased reproduction and immigration. In supplemented populations, reproductive effort by females increased, but the proportion of reproductive females decreased. Reproductive females and nonreproductive animals of both sexes were less likely to be transients than were reproductive males. Transients constituted higher proportions of control populations because of successful settlement, primarily by juveniles and small adults, into supplemented areas. The strongly seasonal climatic conditions under which northern S. hispidus populations exist produce contrasting selective pressures which might favor season-specific foraging strategies. Our data support a scenario of territorial females and wandering males in the reproductive season, with females maximizing resource acquisition for production of offspring. During winter, both sexes may restrict foraging time (and exposure to predators and weather) to the minimum required for survival.

AB The frillneck lizard Chlamydosaurus kingii is an arboreal lizard that is a conspicuous component of the reptile fauna of the wet-dry tropics of northern Australia during the wet season. During the dry season, however, they are secretive, and a previous study revealed that during this season they remain perched in trees and have field metabolic rates only 28% of the wet season levels. Body temperatures (T-b's) of the lizards were measured by radio telemetry throughout the day during the wet and dry seasons. The midday T-b's during the wet season were high (grand mean = 36.7 degrees C) and typical for heliothermic lizards, but the dry season midday T-b's were significantly lower (grand mean = 32.8 degrees C). Microclimatic data and physical characteristics of the lizards were used in a biophysical model to calculate the operative temperatures (T-e) of lizards in the shade, in the sun on a horizontal plane, and normal to the sun at each hour of the day for the two seasons. The T-e's revealed the physical possibility for the lizards to achieve much higher T-b's during the dry season than were measured. Thus, the lower T-b's in the dry season represent a shift in preference rather than an inability to attain a high T-b during the cooler dry season. Inspection of the T-b's and T-e's revealed that although the lizards remained cooler in the dry season, they did not thermoregulate at the lowest possible T-b's. During both seasons the lizards basked in the sun early and late in the day, but during the dry season the lizards stopped intensive basking at a T-b approximate to 4 degrees C lower than in the wet season. An index of the extent to which the lizards exploit the available thermal environment indicates that they thermoregulate carefully in both seasons.
   T-b's were also measured in a laboratory thermal gradient during both seasons, and the T-b's selected during the dry season were significantly lower than those selected in the wet season. This suggests that the seasonal shift in thermal preference is an acclimatization response or an endogenous seasonal cycle rather than a response to a simple thermal cue. The lower T-b's in the dry season result in a conservation of energy and water during a season when these resources are relatively scarce. However, the fact that the lizards do not thermoregulate at the lowest possible T-b's suggests that the dry season T-b's represent a compromise between conservation of resources and the ability to perform other functions such as escape predators and/or digest food.

AB Invertebrate diversity patterns were examined in 11 freshwater habitats (10 streams and a windswept lake shore) of similar physicochemical nature but different thermal and hydrologic stability in the Cass-Craigieburn region, New Zealand. Species richness and density were markedly higher at the more stable sites, but species evenness peaked at sites of intermediate stability. Of the 20 environmental variables examined, a multivariate instability index incorporating temporal variation in depth, temporal variation in current speed, substrate stability, the Pfankuch channel stability index, temperature range, and stream reach tractive force was the single best predictor of the number of species, whereas epilithic pigment concentration was the single best predictor of invertebrate density. The pattern in species richness did not support any of three diversity hypotheses considered. In contrast, the pattern in species evenness suggested competitive exclusion may be occurring patchily and that Huston's dynamic equilibrium model may have some validity, at least at the level of the patch. However, the strong link between productivity and stability apparent in these habitats, and a lack of information on the effects of increased productivity on competition in stream benthic communities makes any firm assessment of the latter model difficult. The observed diversity patterns are, however, consistent with the idea that high diversity is maintained in these habitats by an interaction between low levels of disturbance and habitat patchiness.

AB Variations in growth, flowering, and phenology of two forbs, Acomastylis rossii and Bistorta bistortoides, were compared among six years (1983-1988) and five plant communities (fellfield, dry meadow, moist meadow, wet meadow, snowbed) at an alpine site in the Front Range of Colorado. The purpose was to determine the extent to which the phenological patterns of these species Varied among plant communities acid how interannual climate variability affects phenology and growth. There were significant differences in growth among communities for both species. In B. bistortoides, there were also significant differences among years, due primarily to the influence of a single year (1983) when leaf length increased by approximate to 10% and the average number of B. bistortoides leaves nearly doubled. Key phenological events of both species (initiation of growth, date of maximum leaf length, leaf number, and flower number) were related to snowmelt patterns, resulting in differences among communities. There were also significant differences among years, again primarily related to the single year 1983, the year of a major El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event that produced high snowfall amounts at the site. The increased leaf length in a high snow year is counterintuitive to the commonly accepted notion that alpine species may be limited by season length. We hypothesize that changes in phenology related to changes in snowfall or snowmelt will cause detectable changes in growth, but that these will not be predicted simply from phenology alone. Rather, the timing of snowmelt in relation to nutrient availability, soil moisture, and air temperature will be critical in determining how individual species respond.

AB To evaluate the developmental plasticity of shell morphology in the queen conch Strombus gigas, we conducted transplant experiments at five sites in the Exuma Gays, Bahamas. Juvenile conchs from a sixth site were placed in cages at three sites, in an open cage at a fourth site, and in a naturally confined area at a fifth site. All animals spent 8 mo in the field. At the end of the experiments, the morphology of their shells was quantified by means of univariate and multivariate analyses of size and shape as advocated by Mosimann and James (1979). Comparisons were made within and among experimental groups at the first three sites, between groups at the fourth and fifth sites, and between experimental groups and naturally occurring animals at all six sites.
   Although the experiments extended over only 20% of the juvenile growth period, analyses showed that experimental animals at three of the sites differed significantly in the shapes of their shells. The shapes of these shells were also significantly different from those of the long-spined, bulky shells of naturally occurring animals of similar age at the source site. The greatest change in shape and growth rate occurred at the fifth site, where the rapidly growing uncaged experimental animals developed relatively slender, short-spined shells with large apertures and short spires. These changes were clearly in the direction of the size and shape of unmanipulated animals in the foster population. The results of these experiments, when combined with those of others, suggest that, although variation in the morphology of marine gastropods can have a genetic basis and can be influenced by natural selection, direct environmental induction can be the dominant process underlying patterns of local among-population differentiation. We recommend (1) that the morphometric methods used here to investigate the complex consequences of variation in the size and shape of organisms be applied in other taxa and (2) that the extent to which among-population patterns of geographic variation are directly induced by the environment be given more attention.

AB Using simple analytical models of the probability of disease transmission and a spatially explicit computer simulation of the spread of the aphid-transmitted barley yellow dwarf virus, we examined the effect of vector preference for diseased or healthy hosts on the spread of an economically important plant pathogen. Our analytical models indicate that the effect of vector preference for diseased plants on the probability of disease spread depends on the frequency of diseased plants in the population. In a non-spatial environment with a high frequency of diseased plants, disease spread is favored by vectors preferring healthy plants. With a low frequency of diseased plants, disease spread is favored by vectors preferring diseased plants.
   The effect of vector preference depends on the amount of persistence exhibited by the disease. For persistently transmitted diseases, the vector remains infective for a long period after visiting a diseased host. Persistence increases the rate of spread for a vector preferring healthy hosts more than it increases the rare of spread for a vector preferring diseased hosts.
   Using a Markov chain model of disease transmission, we have shown that an increase in the spatial patchiness of the disease can lead to a decrease in the rate of disease spread by a vector capable of moving only limited distances. The effect of spatial disease structure depends on the preference behavior exhibited by the vector.
   Our spatially explicit computer simulation explored the effect of frequency, persistence, and spatial structure in a dynamic model. All of these factors were shown to be important in describing the impact of vector disease preference on epidemiology, Many of our results contrast with the assumption found in the agricultural literature that a preference for diseased plants leads to an increase in disease spread.
   These results may have implications for the evolution of pathogen-modified vector behavior and/or host attractiveness, Explicit knowledge of the interaction between spatial dynamics and vector preference will improve our ability to model epidemics and predict the spread of infectious diseases.

DE DENSITY DEPENDENCE; FOOD ABUNDANCE; HABITAT HETEROGENEITY; POPULATION

AB Density-dependent reproductive rate may be the result of all individuals in a population suffering reduced fecundity when density increases (Lack 1954), or it may be the result of a lower proportion of individuals living in favorable places at high density (Andrewartha and Birch 1954). We used a key-factor analysis to investigate whether reproductive rate in two red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) populations was density dependent. Four k values were determined, indicating offspring mortality caused by: adult females not entering oestrus (k(1)), oestrous females not giving birth (k(2)), lactating females failing to wean offspring (k(3)), and mortality in litters of successful females (k(4)). We also investigated the effect of food availability on the different k values and tested predictions of the two contrasting hypotheses (Lack vs. Andrewartha and Birch) by examining the mechanisms of density dependence.
   The reproductive performance of female squirrels was monitored over 18 breeding seasons in a coniferous forest and over 16 breeding seasons in a deciduous forest. In the coniferous forest, annual variation in pine seed abundance only affected k(4), which was only weakly related to total mortality of offspring (K). In the deciduous woodland, however, the key factors k(2) and k(3), which were strongly related with total K, were inversely correlated with food abundance. In the coniferous forest, only k(2) was female density dependent, and breeding failure before parturition occurred primarily among floaters, which were more numerous at high density. In the deciduous forest, annual and seasonal variation in the number of floaters caused density dependence in fecundity (k(1)). Increased breeding failure of lactating females (k(3)) with high female density was positively correlated with the number of floaters and with the proportion of females occupying poor quality home ranges. We concluded that density-dependent reproduction in red squirrels can be caused by two mechanisms: a direct density effect of more floaters at high female density, and an effect of habitat heterogeneity, with more females occupying poor territories at high densities, resulting in low breeding success. That reduced fecundity or breeding failure at high densities occurred mainly in female squirrels not occupying good territories, and that annual and seasonal variation in litter size of successful females was not density dependent, supported the predictions of the Andrewartha and Birch (1954) hypothesis.

AB When adults of a species defend feeding territories, juveniles may benefit from access to those territories during periods when prey decline between territorial spaces. Adults may either deny or allow such access, thus impacting the foraging success of the juveniles. We examined a dense population of the terrestrial red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) in which male and female adults hold territories (cover objects on the forest floor that act as patches of moisture and prey during rainless periods) that should be attractive to juveniles as the surrounding leaf litter dries. The purpose of our research was to determine whether adults of P. cinereus exclude juveniles from their territories, as they do consexual adults, and to explore how juveniles respond to adult territoriality.
   We found that adults were uniformly distributed intrasexually under cover objects but positively associated intersexually, during the summer when courtship does not occur. Juveniles entered territories of some adults during dry weather, when foraging in the leaf litter was difficult due to desiccation, but moved back into the leaf litter (out of territories) during rainy periods, when prey were more available. Adults ingested significantly larger prey than juveniles but food niche overlap was large between juveniles and adults, suggesting that competition for limited prey occurs when they share territories during rainless periods.
   In laboratory experiments, juveniles were attracted to territorial pheromones of adult males and females, and males were less aggressive toward such juveniles than toward intruding adult males, Adults were more tolerant of juveniles with which they had cohabited previously in the forest than of juveniles that were ''strangers''; in turn, juveniles spent more time near and less time escaping from previously cohabiting adults than from adult ''strangers.'' Thus, adults appeared to tolerate territorial intrusions by juveniles but were more tolerant of some juveniles than of others.
   We examined several hypotheses that may explain why adults might allow certain juveniles into their feeding territories during stressful periods. Our data best fit a ''kin recognition'' hypothesis. Kin recognition is known to occur in other species of salamanders and, in our study, adults and juveniles that had previously cohabited on the forest floor were more benign toward each other than were those that had not cohabited, Our data do not favor the ''no competition'' hypothesis because juveniles entered adult territories just when both adults and juveniles were able to ingest fewer prey (dry weather). Our results do not favor the hypothesis that juveniles sneak into adult territories undetected because juveniles move into adults' territories when adults are present, and histological evidence suggests that juveniles possess glands used in social communication. We do not favor the hypothesis that adults habituate to cohabiting juveniles because habituation is not likely to occur between food competitors when the adults can easily defeat the juveniles. The hypothesis of ''dear enemy'' (neighbor) recognition, which occurs between territorial adults of this species, is unlikely to be correct because juveniles do not act as territorial neighbors.
   Adults appear to act as time minimizers during territorial defense. Juveniles, whether or not related to those adults, appear to act as energy maximizers, moving from leaf litter to cover objects as prey availability shifts.

AB Ideal Free theory has furthered our understanding of the processes determining the distribution of mobile foragers in a spatially heterogeneous (patchy) habitat. The Input Matching rule derived from Ideal Free theory has been used to predict forager distributions, but does not account for unshared environmentally induced costs that individuals may incur. Drift-feeding stream fish typically contend with such costs in the form of (1) an energetic cost of maintaining position while foraging in moving water, and (2) a decrease in the proportion of drift food items they can capture as current speed increases. These costs often differ between patches, and the cost of position maintenance is unaffected by changes in the number of fish foraging in a patch. Here, we developed an Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) model (IFD With Costs) to describe forager distributions in a habitat composed of parches in which foragers compete for food and incur an energetic cost when foraging that is unaffected by the number of competitors in the patch.
   We tested the ability of two versions of the IFD With Costs as well as two alternative IFD models to predict the distribution of minnows (Rhinicthys atratulus) foraging in a laboratory how-tank with two side-by-side patches. In all trials the patches differed in their supply of drift food, and in some trials the patches had different water velocities. When the patches' water velocities differed, the fish distributions (1) changed as the total supply of food in the two patches increased while the ratio of food supply in the patches remained constant, (2) did not match relative food availabilities in the patches, and (3) favored the slow water velocity patch. One version of the IFD With Costs predicted each of these results while none of the alternative models could account for these findings. The results support the hypothesis that fish quantitatively integrate energetic gains and costs in a manner similar to that described by the IFD With Costs when making patch selections.

AB A plant's competitive ability is determined by its capacity to acquire resources from resource pools shared with neighbors. Resource acquisition abilities depend on plant part placement in relation to available resources. Using a model system of annuals, we examined how the architecture of and allocation to plant parts was affected by different neighbor species. Species having different morphologies were grown as ''targets'' (target plants) in continuous canopies of each of four neighbor species in the greenhouse. Architectural and allocational traits of Abutilon theophrasti did not vary significantly with neighbor identity. Several architectural and allocational traits of Datura stramonium and Polygonum pensylvanicum plants did vary significantly among neighbor identities; however, in all but two cases, analyses of covariance revealed that these differences were due to differences in shoot biomass among neighbors. We could therefore not relate changes in architecture and allocation to the effects of specific neighbors, and therefore to competitive ability under specific conditions. In all species part masses were more variable than part lengths or areas, suggesting that allocational flexibility in these species allowed them to maximize part size at the expense of part mass to some extent. When we examined within- plant biomass allocation patterns among plants of different size classes, regardless of neighbor, we found differences among species in how these patterns changed with plant size. Abutilon and Datura plants in the smallest size class showed a marked reduction in allocation to stems in the upper canopy, while producing similar numbers of nodes, when compared to plants in the largest size class. By contrast, Polygonum plants in the smallest size class produced many fewer nodes than, but had a relative allocation pattern similar to, plants in the largest size class. These differences had consequences for plant shape, and so suggest differences among species in architectural response to shading. Any such response that allowed a plant to increase its resource-gathering ability would represent an important mechanism of competition.

AB Merriam's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys merriami) store seeds in burrows (larderhoarding) and in small clumps in shallow holes dug in the soil (scatterhoarding). We used a large laboratory arena with an artificial burrow for larderhoarding and four sand-filled compartments for scatterhoarding to test several alternative hypotheses about spatial patterns of food caching. The hypotheses were that kangaroo rats prefer to (1) larderhoard seeds in burrows, (2) scatterhoard seeds near burrows, (3) scatterhoard seeds away from burrows, (4) scatterhoard seeds near food sources, or (5) make widely spaced scatterhoards. Three treatments that differed in the distance between the burrow and food source were used to discriminate among hypotheses (2) through (4). There was a substantial amount of variation among individuals in proportion of seeds that were larderhoarded. Subjects initially scatterhoarded seeds close to the food source, but distributed caches more evenly among caching compartments as trials progressed. Increased evenness of cache distribution resulted from harvesting and repositioning of extant caches as well as selective placement of new caches. Initial caching close to food may be adaptive by maximizing harvest rates during flushes of seed production and making seeds unavailable to non-digging competitors (birds and ants). Subsequent redistribution of caches may make them less available to other rodents that locate buried seeds by smell and use area-restricted search to find closely spaced scatterhoards.

AB We studied relationships between body size of female Black Brant goslings (Branta bernicla nigricans) late in their growth period and first year survival, eventual adult body size, breeding propensity, and size and volume of clutches they eventually produced to examine the relationship between growth and fitness in this population. We indexed body size by calculating PC1 scores based on either culmen and tarsus, or culmen, tarsus, and mass. Gosling (PC scores based on culmen and tarsus) size was positively correlated with resighting rate (P = 0.005), indicating that larger goslings survived at a higher rate than did smaller goslings. Gosling size was correlated with adult size of the same individuals (P = 0.0004). Larger goslings were more likely to breed as 2- or 3-yr-olds than were medium or small goslings (P = 0.008). Larger adult brant laid more eggs (P = 0.03) and produced clutches with greater total volume (P = 0.03) than did smaller brant. Given the important role of foraging environment in growth of goslings, these data suggest an important role of early environment in determining life-history traits.

AB We tested whether effects of competition and herbivory on plant growth depend on the aboveground biomass of vegetation. Our objective was to test theoretical predictions about the site-dependence of biotic mechanisms of plant population regulation. Biomass ranged from a mean of 64 to 776 g/m(2) at the eight study sites, which included six old fields and two herbaceous plant communities near water. To measure effects of competition, 4-5 wk old plants of a perennial grass (Poa compressa) were transplanted into plots where neighboring plants were either left intact or removed and after 4 mo the shoot mass of transplants was compared in the two treatments. Transplants were caged in both treatments to exclude herbivores. Removing neighbors increased transplant shoot mass significantly at all sites, indicating that transplants experienced less competition for resources when their neighbors were removed. Regression analysis indicated that the increase in shoot mass due to neighbor removal was significantly greater at sites with higher biomass. This result supports theories that predict competition should increase with increasing biomass. To measure effects of herbivory, the growth of caged and uncaged plants was compared. Caging transplants did not increase their shoot mass significantly at the two sites with the lowest biomass. However, shoot mass was significantly greater for caged transplants than for uncaged transplants at all other sites. Caged transplants lost less tissue to herbivores such as small mammals and molluscs. Regression analysis indicated that the increase in shoot mass due to caging was significantly greater at sites with higher biomass. The combined effect of herbivory and competition was measured by comparing transplant growth in plots where transplants were caged and neighbors were removed with the growth of transplants in plots where transplants were not caged and neighbors were left intact. Transplant shoot mass was significantly greater where herbivores were excluded and neighbors were removed, especially at sites with high biomass. Our results indicate that competition and herbivory each have a greater effect on plant growth at sites with higher biomass and that herbivory has less effect than competition on plant growth at sites with relatively low biomass.

AB We examined the relationship between plant density and the probability of infection by a rust (Puccinia recondita) in a natural population of jewelweed (Impatiens capensis). We also reduced plant density in field manipulations to determine whether there is any synergism between intraspecific competition and infection by the rust. The results showed no relationship between plant density and the probability of infection. However, we found that the effect of infection depends on plant density. Uninfected plants grew significantly faster than infected plants under natural conditions of high density, but infection had no significant effect on growth where density was experimentally reduced. Hence, the effect of disease on jewelweed depends on the plant's competitive environment. Such interactions between competition and disease are likely to be important to the population biology and breeding-system evolution of plants.

AB Geographic variation in thermal environment may significantly influence the energetics of ectotherms, and thus may serve as a mechanism for geographic variation in growth and reproduction. Thermal environment affects body temperature (T-b) that, in turn, has consequences both for the amount of time available for surface activities such as foraging, and for physiological processes such as metabolism I studied effects of differences in thermal environment on T-b, surface use, and resting metabolism of mottled rock rattlesnakes (Crotalus lepidus) from two populations (Boquillas: BOQ, and Grapevine Hills: GVH) in Big Bend National Park, Texas. Snakes in these populations differed in growth rate and adult body size, and these differences may be related to the influence of thermal environment on energetics. During summer months, operative environmental temperatures at BOQ were hotter than at GVH. Hotter BOQ environmental temperatures resulted in approximate to 64% less time available for diurnal surface use (e.g., foraging) at BOQ relative to GVH. Hotter BOQ environmental temperatures also constrained the average T-b of BOQ snakes at night to be from 2 degrees C to 4.5 degrees C hotter than GVH snakes during July and August. Despite hotter T-b, estimated resting metabolic expenditures of BOQ snakes during July and August were similar to estimated expenditures of GVH snakes because BOQ snakes had lower mass-specific metabolic rates. Results of this study were consistent with the hypothesis of greater energy limitation at BOQ, and underscored the importance of population-specific data for understanding geographic variation in energy acquisition and allocation.

AB We studied the effects of habitat fragmentation on the movements of cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus), deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), and prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) living in a fragmented landscape using 7.7 yr (1984-1992) of mark-recapture data. The study area included three kinds of 0.5-ha blocks: single large patches (5000 m(2)), clusters of medium patches (288 m(2)), and clusters of small patches (32 m(2)). We tested three predictions regarding animal movements. First, animals should move longer distances as fragmentation increases. Second, the proportion of animals moving will decrease as fragmentation increases. Third, species will show more movement from putative sources to putative sinks. In support of our first two predictions, all species (except male cotton rats) moved farther, and lower proportions of animals moved, as fragmentation increased. In testing our third prediction, we found no trends, for all species, between patch size and the net number of animals a block either imported or exported, indicating source-sink dynamics were probably not occurring on our study site. Furthermore, animals of all species (except female deer mice) switched more frequently to blocks of larger patches. For prairie voles in the spring and deer mice in the summer, relative abundances among blocks predicted from a Markov matrix model of switching probabilities showed high congruence with the actual abundances, indicating movement and abundances were related. In both cotton rats and prairie voles but not in deer mice, more juveniles and nonreproductive animals switched between blocks than did adults or reproductive animals. Deer mice switched more frequently than did either cotton rats or prairie voles; the latter species switched in similar frequencies. We discuss the implications of our data for modeling and conservation.

AB Differences among conspecifics in body mass result from underlying differences in structural size and physiological condition. To determine whether the structural or physiological component of body mass has a stronger influence on reproductive traits at parturition, we studied the body composition (lean dry mass and fat content), structural size (1st principal component scores computed from 10 skeletal measurements), and body condition (residuals from regression of body mass on structural size) of yearling and older female Richardson's ground squirrels (Spermophilus richardsonii). At parturition, differences among yearlings in body mass primarily reflected differences in structural size associated with continuing structural growth. Older females appeared to reach a deterministic adult structural size, and body mass of older females was most strongly associated with body condition. Structural size of yearling females and body condition of older females had significant positive effects on litter mass. For older females, date of parturition had a significant negative influence on litter size. Both yearling and older females exhibited significant positive effects of parturition date and body condition on neonate mass. In older females, a trade-off resulted in smaller litters of heavier neonates as the breeding season progressed, perhaps reflecting the need for rapid growth of offspring before hibernation. Maternal size, maternal condition, and seasonal timing were important aspects of reproduction in Richardson's ground squirrels, but these characteristics are seldom considered concurrently in studies of life histories.

AB We investigated the life history consequences of age at primiparity in two marked populations of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), studied for 19 and 12 yr. Some ewes first lambed at 2 yr of age, others at 3 or 4 yr. Lambs of 2-yr-old ewes were smaller and less viable than lambs of older ewes. Lactation at 2 yr did not affect survival to 3 yr, but in one population it was associated with reduced survival from 3 to 4 yr. Two yr olds that weaned lambs gained less mass during summer than other 2 yr olds. Overwinter mass loss from 2 to 3 yr was correlated with autumn body mass, and was lower for parous than for nonparous ewes. Reproductive success at 3 yr was independent of reproductive status at 2 yr. At 4 yr, ewes that lactated as 2 yr olds were smaller than ewes that had not lactated as 2 yr olds. In one population, negative effects of early maturation upon mass gain and subsequent reproductive success became evident at high density, and very few 2 yr olds lambed when population density was high. The lifetime reproductive success of early-maturing ewes was not lower than that of late-maturing ewes. To account for individual variation in initial reproductive potential, we controlled body mass as a yearling, a variable that affected reproductive success. Mass as a yearling, however, did not interact with age of primiparity to affect survival, growth, or reproductive success. Uncertainties about resource availability and possible effects of genotype and body fat may explain why many ewes postponed their first reproduction despite apparently low life history costs of early maturation.

AB When subject to long-term directional environmental perturbations, changes in population densities depend on the positive and negative feedbacks operating through interactions within and among species in a community. This paper develops techniques to predict the long-term responses of population densities to environmental changes using data on short-term population fluctuations driven by short-term environmental variability. In addition to giving quantitative predictions, the techniques also reveal how different qualitative patterns of species interactions either buffer or accentuate population responses to environmental trends. All of the predictions are based on regression coefficients extracted from time series data, and they can therefore be applied with a minimum of mathematical and statistical gymnastics.

AB Hyporheic metabolism in a Sonoran Desert stream was examined, focusing on the sources of detritus supporting hyporheic respiration. Two alternative hypotheses were specifically addressed: (1) organic matter derived from the surface stream supports hyporheic respiration, and (2) detritus buried during flash floods supports hyporheic respiration. As predicted for the surface-derived organic matter hypothesis, respiration was lowest immediately following flash floods and increased significantly with time after flood (P < 0.001). Hyporheic respiration ranged from 0.05 mgO(2) . L sediments(-1). h(-1) immediately following a flash flood to as high as 4.41 mgO(2) . L sediments(-1). h(-1) late in algal succession. Respiration was significantly correlated with surface algal biomass during two spring/summer successional sequences (P < 0.05; partial correlation coefficients 0.58 and 0.88). Respiration was also consistently higher in downwelling than upwelling zones with overall mean rates of 1.12 and 0.46 mgO(2) . L sediments(-1). h(-1), respectively. Respiration exhibited a distinct diel pattern with highest rate coinciding with time of maximum photosynthesis and was also significantly correlated with dissolved organic carbon concentration (P < 0.05), further supporting the hypothesis of hyporheic dependence on algal production. Flash floods bury organic matter that is also respired in the hyporheic zone; however, based upon storage of organic carbon immediately following floods, an average of only 15% of the observed respiration could be supported. We conclude that hyporheic respiration in Sycamore Creek is tightly linked to surface production. It is spatially distributed in biotic ''hot spots'' where surface waters enter hyporheic sediments and is most likely supported by organic matter that is supplied as dissolved organic carbon, perhaps from algal production.

AB Leaf damage is known to adversely affect reproductive output through the female (fruit and seed) function, but little is known about the effects of leaf damage on the male function of plants. This study simulates the timing, location, and pattern of natural herbivory by diabroticite beetles and shows that leaf damage reduces male reproductive success in Cucurbita texana. Partially defoliated branches of C. texana produced significantly fewer staminate flowers and fewer pollen grains per flower than undamaged branches on the same plant. Moreover, pollen from staminate flowers on partially defoliated plants was less likely to sire seeds than pollen from undamaged plants when deposited onto a stigma with pollen from a tester line, indicating that leaf damage not only decreases pollen production but also adversely affects pollen performance.

AB We tested the Walker and Syers (1976) conceptual model of soil development and its ecological implications by analyzing changes in soil P, vegetation, and other ecosystem properties on a soil chronosequence with six sites ranging in age from 300 yr to 4.1 X 10(6) yr. Climate, dominant vegetation, slope, and parent material of all of the sites were similar. As fractions of total P, the various pools of soil phosphorus behaved very much as predicted by Walker and Syers. HCl-extractable P (presumably primary mineral phosphates) comprised 82% of total P at the 300-yr-old site, and then decreased to 1% at the 20,000-yr-old site. Organic phosphorus increased from the youngest site to a maximum at the 150 000 yr site, and then declined to the 4.1 X 10(6) yr site. Occluded (residual) P increased steadily with soil age. In contrast to the Walker and Syers model, we found the highest total P at the 150 000-yr-old site, rather than at the onset of soil development, and we found that the non-occluded, inorganic P fraction persisted through to the oldest chronosequence site. Total soil N and C increased substantially from early to middle soil development in parallel with organic P, and then declined through to the oldest site.
   Readily available soil P, NH4+, and NO3- were measured using anion and cation exchange resin bags. P availability increased and decreased unimodally across the chronosequence. NH4+ and NO3- pools increased through early soil development, but did not systematically decline late in soil development.
   In situ decomposition rates of Metrosideros polymorpha litter were highest at two intermediate-aged sites with high soil fertility (20 000 yr and 150 000 yr), and lowest at the less-fertile beginning (300 yr) and endpoint (4.1 X 10(6) yr) of the chronosequence. M. polymorpha leaves collected from these same four sites, and decomposed in a common site, suggested that leaves from intermediate-aged sites were inherently more decomposable than those from the youngest and oldest sites. Both litter tissue quality and the soil environment appeared to influence rates of decomposition directly.
   The highest mean soil N2O emissions (809 mu g . m(-2). d(-1)) were measured at the 20 000-yr-old site, which also had the highest soil nitrogen fertility status.
   Plant communities at all six chronosequence sites were dominated primarily by M. polymorpha, and to a lesser extent by several other genera of trees and shrubs. There were, however, differences in overall vegetation community composition among the sites. Using a detrended correspondence analysis (DECORANA), we found that a high proportion of species variance among the sites (eigenvalue = 0.71) can be explained by site age and thus soil developmental stage.
   Overall, long-term soil development across the chronosequence largely coincides with the conceptual model of Walker and Syers (1976). How P is distributed among different organic and inorganic fractions at a given stage of soil development provides a useful context for evaluating contemporary cycling of P and other nutrients, and for determining how changes in P availability might affect diverse ecosystem processes.

AB Systems of induced resistance for both vertebrates and invertebrates possess a memory; individuals that are attacked by a particular pathogen are able to respond more quickly and more effectively the second time they encounter that pathogen. Many plants have been found to be more induced by repeated herbivory than by a single bout of herbivory. In these experiments the frequency and magnitude of damage were confounded so that it was not clear if memory was involved or if more overall damage amplified the induced response. We conducted an experiment to test the memory of induced resistance in cotton to repeated attacks by spider mites. We held the overall amount of damage (herbivore-days) constant but varied the number of times that plants were exposed to damage. We did not find that plants damaged a second time responded more effectively than those damaged only once. Power analysis indicated that a large effect of memory was unlikely to have been overlooked in these experiments if it existed.
   Following observations that different types of damage caused different responses in mountain birch (Haukioja et al. 1990), we damaged either cotyledonary leaves or apical buds of young cotton plants and challenged them with spider mites. We found that damage to cotyledons induced resistance but damage to apical buds induced susceptibility. Damage to cotyledons accelerated the rate of abscission of cotyledons, a favored tissue for spider mites; damage to buds delayed abscission of cotyledons. Cotyledon abscission was sufficient to induce resistance but was not a necessary condition since induced resistance has been observed when cotyledon abscission was not found. Our results were consistent with the hypothesis that damage to these two tissues differentially affected hormonal regulation as well as the alternative hypothesis that these forms of damage had opposite effects on plant ontogeny.

AB Reductions in host survival due to parasitism have immediate effects on the population dynamics of both parasites and hosts. Despite its potential importance, parasite-induced host mortality has rarely been studied experimentally under natural conditions. We conducted a series of field releases of Drosophila putrida and Duosophila neotestacea that had been parasitized in the laboratory by the nematode Howardula aoronymphium. In 11 out of 12 independent tests, the proportion of flies that were parasitized declined significantly through time, suggesting that parasites cause host mortality. Independent tests showed that parasites have no detectable effect on dispersal of flies and that motherworms do not disappear from surviving hosts, thus supporting the conclusion that parasites cause significant host mortality in the field. Host mortality rate increased with worm burden, significantly so in four independent tests. This is a possible mechanism for density-dependent regulation of these parasite populations. Parasite-induced mortality was considerably greater among flies that had been released in the field than among those kept concurrently in the laboratory. Thus, laboratory or clinical trials may not provide an accurate assessment of parasite virulence in natural populations. These results support a central assumption of many recent ecological and evolutionary models, i.e., that parasites are harmful to their hosts under natural conditions.

AB Reproductive success in relation to egg size was studied in European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) by swapping whole clutches between nests at the start of the incubation period. Egg size did not reflect parental quality as no measure of reproductive success was correlated with the foster mothers' mean egg size. There was a significant positive relationship between the mean size of the cross-fostered eggs and the subsequent mean size of hatchlings. The mean size of cross-fostered eggs did not affect hatching success or nestling growth rates, and initial nestling size differences between broods with large and small eggs persisted for <1 wk. No effect of mean egg size on mean nestling survival could be detected. Furthermore, a partial cross-fostering experiment, where nestlings were swapped between nests the day after hatching, failed to demonstrate any lasting effect of egg size on nestling size. It is suggested that mean egg size may only influence reproductive success during particularly inferior environmental conditions.

AB A severe hurricane affected Jamaican montane rain forests in 1988. We made local and widespread measurements of tree condition in three periods: prehurricane 1974-1984 (preh.); hurricane 1984-1989 (h.); and post-hurricane 1989-1992 (post-h.). In the h. period, 7.22% of stems and 4.72% of the total basal area died; crown loss was the most frequent cause of mortality. Among individual tree species, the hurricane caused a large range in mortality (0-26%) and non-fatal damage. Post-h. mortality was greater than mortality in the h. period, and varied among species. Post-h. stem growth rates (all species combined) were more than double the prehurricane rates, but species showed a considerable range from no significant increase to eight times greater.
   We classified 20 common tree species using damage scores (normalized h. mortality, plus normalized change in mortality from preh. to post-h., plus normalized complete crown loss in h.) and response scores (normalized change, preh. to post-h., in recruitment to the greater than or equal to 3 cm dbh size class, plus normalized change in growth rate from preh. to post-h., plus normalized frequency of sprouts). Species were assigned to one of four groups: resistant (11 species), with low damage and low response; susceptible (5 species), with high damage and low response; resilient(1 species), with high damage and high response; and usurpers (3 species), with low damage and high responsiveness. The grouping of species was broadly related to their regeneration requirements. Most species with seedlings usually found under closed canopy were resistant; three of the four species with seedlings usually found on landslides were also resistant. Species with seedlings most frequently found in gaps included resilient, susceptible, and usurper species, but were not usually resistant.
   It is likely that the three species classified as usurpers will increase their relative abundance in the forest in the next decades and that Cyathea pubescens, which was very susceptible, will decrease in relative abundance of adults. Most of the other species are likely to have small changes in their relative abundances. Thus, at present, hurricanes have few long-term effects on the forests, although a change in the disturbance regime may alter this.

AB Because of its presumed high levels of dioecy (separate male and female plants), study of the native Hawaiian angiosperm flora has been important in development of many hypotheses about conditions favoring the evolution of dioecy. The importance of ecological correlates with dioecy has proven difficult to assess, however, because of lack of data on the origins of dioecy in the Hawaiian Islands. Clearly, these correlations are of greater interest in taxa where dioecy evolved in the Hawaiian Islands (autochthonous evolution of dioecy) than in taxa that are the result of dioecious colonists with subsequent speciation in the Hawaiian Islands. Because the Hawaiian flora is small and extremely isolated, colonists can be identified and their breeding systems hypothesized, thus allowing inferences on the origins of dioecy. Using current taxonomic information, the incidence of dioecy in native Hawaiian angiosperm species is 14.7%, lower than previous estimates, but still the highest of any known flora worldwide. Ten percent of the colonists were sexually dimorphic (dioecious, gynodioecious, polygamodioecious, and subdioecious), and over half (55.2%) of current dimorphic species are in lineages arising from dimorphic colonists, showing that dimorphism is high in part because colonists were dimorphic. Autochthonous evolution of dimorphism occurred in at least 12 lineages (e.g., hermaphroditic colonists of Bidens (Asteraceae), the Hawaiian Alsinoideae (Caryophyllaceae), and Hedyotis (Rubiaceae) led to species-rich lineages that include many dimorphic species). One-third (31.8%) of current dimorphic species are in lineages arising from monomorphic colonists. Dioecy in the Hawaiian Islands is a result of both dimorphic colonists as well as evolution of dioecy in Hawaiian lineages from hermaphroditic colonists. The high incidence of dimorphism is not because dimorphic colonists evolved more species per colonist than monomorphic colonists. Detailed studies of individual lineages are critical to elucidate causal factors in the evolution of dioecy.

AB Evolutionary causes and ecological consequences of sexual differences in hermit crabs were examined through their life history patterns, habitats, behavioral responses to seasonal and size differences in the utilization of vacant shell resources and intraspecific competitive ability. The sand-dwelling hermit crab, Diogenes nitidimanus, and the sand snail, Umbonium moniliferum, were extremely abundant in the study area, comprising a virtually single resource and utilizer system. Size-frequency distributions of the crabs were nearly flat for males but had a prominent peak for larger females, suggesting different patterns of growth and mortality for the two sexes. No conspicuous peak in the size range of small crabs was obvious in size-frequency histograms for each sex from September to the following June. Males were larger than females.
   The number and size of vacant shells produced by the population of U. moniliferum, estimated from their survivorship and growth curves, indicated that both extremely small and large shells were readily available, whereas medium-sized shells suitable for small crabs were relatively rare. This resulted in small crabs using shells that were damaged, much smaller than the sizes they preferred, and of less common species or species that did not inhabit the sand flat.
   Habitat use by males was more diverse than by females. The males used shells of U. moniliferum and other snails inhabiting the sand flat and shells of preferred size more frequently than did females, and also tended to use shells that were larger and more variable in size, Shells that were broken or epibiota covered were less preferred by both sexes, although epibiota-covered shells were used more frequently by males. Broken shells were used at similar frequency by both sexes.
   Crabs supplied with shells of a similar size distribution to that available in the field were cultured for 1 yr. Males tended to grow faster than females, exhausting the limited supply of medium-sized shells. The smaller crabs restrained their growth until such shells became available, explaining the absence of a peak of small crabs in the field population. Although the sex ratio of the field population was female biased, that of the laboratory population was 1:1, indicating that males had a higher mortality rate in the field.
   These results suggest that males are better intraspecific competitors than females in the acquisition of vacant shells. This quality enables males to grow larger, which is advantageous in the acquisition of females. However, shell scarcity produced greater stress in males resulting in their higher mortality rate.

AB Dense populations of patellid limpets characterize the mid- to low-intertidal communities of the southwestern rocky shores of South Africa. Patella argenvillei and P. granatina reach average densities up to 200/m(2), representing in some cases approximate to 10-13 kg/m(2) of whole wet biomass, and attain sizes up to 100-mm shell length. Traditionally these limpets have been regarded as generalized grazers, but in fact they have highly specialized feeding mechanisms. P. granatina is found primarily on the mid- to low shore of sheltered boulder-bays, while P. argenvillei forms a conspicuous monospecific belt low on semi-exposed shores in association with adjacent kelp beds. Both species are the dominant occupiers of space in their respective habitats. We have investigated the main pathways and supply of food necessary to maintain limpet biomasses as high as this. Epilithic micro- and macroalgae and the kelps Ecklonia maxima and Laminaria pallida are common sources of food for these two limpet species. Gut contents show that kelp represents > 50% of the total diet of both species. An abundant source of food is provided to P. granatina by drifting kelp and seaweed debris, and to P. argenvillei by nearby attached kelp plants, which they actively prune. Differences in the timing and method of feeding exist. P. granatina captures drifting kelp and seaweeds while underwater during incoming and outgoing tides, and P. argenvillei prunes the fronds of nearby attached kelp plants during the rising tide. P. argenvillei feeds collectively, several individuals sharing a piece of kelp trapped by a single limpet. This overcomes the intraspecific competition normally experienced in high density limpet populations, and the maximum size of P. argenvillei rises with density. P. granatina does not feed collectively and its maximum size declines with density. An experimental exclusion of kelp from the limpets' diets resulted in significantly increased mortality and a reduction in body mass. Subtidal production of kelp fronds subsidizes populations of both limpet species and is vital to the maintenance of their remarkably high biomasses. Supplied with a superabundance of food, both species achieve such high ''packing'' that primary space becomes their limiting factor. The trophic subsidy provided by kelps has important secondary consequences since the dense limpet populations powerfully influence intertidal community structure and function.

   Vegetation at the study site covers 15-20% of the soil surface and is dominated by five shrubs: Brownanthus ciliatus (Mesembryanthemoideae), Ruschia spinosa (Ruschioideae), Galenia fruticosa (Aizoaceae), Pteronia pallens (Asteraceae), and Osteospermum sinuatum (Asteraceae). Grasses and annuals play little part in the dynamics of this vegetation.
   The model is based on detailed life history data for the five dominant species and on monthly long-term rainfall data for this region, The method of ''dynamic automata'' is employed to model individual plants. Growth, death, seed production, germination, and seedling establishment are modelled over long rime scales in annual time steps under the influence of the stochastic and unpredictable rainfall in ungrazed rangeland. In the absence of grazing, survival of seedlings depends on their competitive bility during the seedling stage and their ability to compete with established plants in neighboring cells.
   The model shows that the dynamics of this shrub community are typified by episodic and discontinuous changes in species composition with intervening quasistable phases lasting some decades. The reason for this episodic behavior is that both recruitment and mortality of plants depend on particular conditions. Using 93 complete data sets with monthly rainfall data taken at the weather station in Prince Albert we show that rainfall is only sufficient for seedling recruitment in 44% of all years for B. ciliatus and in < 30% of all years for the four other species. We identify two types of abrupt and discontinuous changes in species composition: (1) big recruitment events that can only occur if plant density is low and if rainfall conditions are extraordinarily favorable and (2) big mortality events that can only occur if cohorts, originating from big recruitment events, die within a short period of time and if little further recruitment has taken place,
   However, this behavior is not a property of the biota but is generated by rainfall input to the model. By using a different rainfall input, the model can also display regular cyclic succession. Therefore there appeared to be no contradiction between sudden, discontinuous changes and gradual, continuous and reversible changes in vegetation composition.

AB Lobelia dortmanna is a common representative of the small isoetid plants dominating the vegetation on sandy sediments in nutrient-poor softwater lakes in North America and Europe. We report here the discovery of pronounced depth profiles and pulses of dissolved O-2 and CO2 in the pen-water of vegetated sediments between light and darkness. Pulses of O-2 and CO2 were extensive in the upper sediment layers of high root density, because Lobelia roots absorb CO2 and release O-2 during photosynthesis, but absorb O-2 and release CO2 during respiration, whereas fluxes across leaf surfaces are impeded by a cuticle of low gas permeability. Release of most O-2 from the roots during Lobelia photosynthesis leads to O, concentrations close to saturation in the root zone and O-2 penetration to great sediment depth because of low microbial O-2 consumption rates. The CO2 concentrations in the root zone of the most nutrient-poor sediments examined here (0.37-0.71 mmol/L) were below the levels required to saturate Lobelia photosynthesis (>3 mmol/L), and experimental enrichment with CO2 stimulated the development of higher O-2 concentrations in the root zone. Cycles of O-2, CO2 and nutrients are, therefore, intimately coupled in the Lobelin-sediment system, in contrast to terrestrial and other aquatic plants, where gas and nutrient fluxes are physically separated between leaves and roots and their respective surrounding media. The release of O-2 from the roots should ensure efficient aerobic degradation of organic matter, lead to oxidized forms of Fe, Mn, and N, and can supply O-2 to mycorrhizal fungi and an aerobic fauna associated with the roots.

AB The ''predation-sensitive food'' (PSF) hypothesis proposes that both food and predation necessarily limit populations, because as food becomes limiting animals take greater risks to obtain more food, and some of these are killed. Alternative hypotheses are ''predator regulation'' where predators hold the prey population well below starvation levels; and ''surplus'' predation where predators kill only those prey that are excluded from optimal habitat and are dying from starvation.
   The predictions from these hypotheses were tested by examining body condition of Serengeti wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) over 24 yr (1968-1991). Two phases of population growth were examined: 1968-1973 when the population was increasing with superabundant food; and 1977-1991 when the population was stationary and regulated by intraspecific competition for food. Three categories of data were compared: live animals, predation kills, and nonpredation deaths. Body condition was measured from bone marrow, the last reserves of fat in ungulates. The predator regulation hypothesis predicts that the marrow condition should be similar in the predation and live samples. The surplus hypothesis predicts the predation and nonpredation samples should be similar. The PSF hypothesis predicts that marrow condition of the predation sample should be (1) poorer than that of the live sample, (2) better than that of the nonpredation sample, and (3) better when food is limiting than when it is abundant.
   Analyses of the frequency distribution of marrow categories showed that both the predation and nonpredation samples were significantly poorer than that of the live population. In both increase and stationary phases of population growth, the predation sample was in better condition than the nonpredation sample. The predation sample was not quite significantly better (P = 0.052) when food was limiting. These results are consistent with the PSF hypothesis and inconsistent with both of the alternative hypotheses. Female and male condition was similar in the predation sample, but females were killed at a younger age. Lions and hyenas killed animals in similar condition, but lions took animals at a younger age. The results suggest that (1) body condition affects the vulnerability of individual wildebeest to predation, and (2) predation jointly limits the population with intraspecific competition by removing animals from the population that are in better condition than those that are starving.

AB Factors limiting seed germination and seedling establishment of the hemiepiphyte Ficus stupenda were investigated with two field experiments conducted in a Bornean rain forest canopy. In Experiment I, seeds of F. stupenda were planted in potential establishment sites averaging 31 m above the ground in each of 45 dipterocarp trees. Twenty seeds each were planted in a total of 336 sites. Germination, survivorship, and growth were monitored over 1 yr, and examined in relation to microsite and host tree characteristics. The presence of substrate with good moisture retention (soil, rotting wood, or moss) was the most important factor for germination. Such substrates were most frequently associated with knothole sites in the canopy, which had the highest level of establishment success. Seedling survival to 12 mo was low (1.3% of planted seeds), especially considering that the best available sites in each tree were selected. Only 0.04% of seedlings showed vigorous growth after 12 mo. A seed-harvesting ant in the genus Pheidole significantly reduced germination success, and herbivory and desiccation killed many seedlings at later stages. In Experiment 2, seedling growth in natural canopy sites was compared with growth of seedlings in artificial planter boxes raised into the canopy in order to assess the relative quality of canopy sites. Planters were superior to natural sites for seedling survivorship and supported much more rapid seedling growth with a positive response to light level. Higher growth rates in planters compared with natural sites showed that water stress appeared to be the critical factor limiting seedling growth in the canopy, even in this very wet climate. Sites in the canopy with the optimal combination of conditions for fig seedling establishment appear to be very scarce. Ficus population densities may be limited by both biotic and abiotic factors reducing early recruitment success.

AB Recent theoretical and empirical studies suggest that an animal's long-distance dispersal behavior can have a major influence on its population dynamics. In this study I examined the role of dispersal in the population dynamics of a goldenrod leaf beetle, Trihabda virgata. I measured the long-distance emigration rates of this beetle in the field under different population densities. I manipulated densities of Triphabda larvae early in the season to create crowded, heavily defoliated host patches and uncrowded, lightly defoliated patches. Newly emerged, teneral beetles were added to these two density treatments and their long-distance emigration rates were measured. Beetles hew from host patches that had high densities of adults and heavy damage caused by larvae. No flight was detected from low-density patches with little defoliation. Beetles that had developed in these crowded and uncrowded patches were placed on lush, undefoliated plants as teneral adults. Their emigration rates did not differ. In a final experiment, female beetles were placed on plants with or without mates. The plants were one of two types, either heavily defoliated or lush. On lush plants, females without mates showed a stronger tendency to leave than females that had access to mates. On defoliated plants, females left at high rates whether or not mates were present. These experiments indicate that long-distance emigration is triggered by conditions experienced during the teneral phase. Heavy host defoliation inflicted by high population densities appears to induce flight. This density-dependent emigration should reduce local population pressure and result in the spread of local outbreaks across a larger area. The influence of dispersal on population dynamics will vary depending on the pattern of beetle densities across the region.

AB Research on the genetics of development and on reactions to environmental changes (phenotypic plasticity) is important to understand the evolution of natural populations, mostly because of the possible adaptive meaning of some plastic responses, and because of the suggested role of plasticity in maintaining genetic variation. In this paper, we present a study of developmental norms of reaction of two populations of Lobelia siphilitica (Lobeliaceae) to three levels of light availability. We investigated: (1) the plasticity to light of characters determining phenological timing and of end-of-season traits, and (2) the shape of the ontogenetic reaction norms of plant height and number of leaves in the (Time, Environment, Phenotype) space. We found genetic variation for bolting time, fruit production, final leaf number, rate of stem elongation, and rate of leaf production. We detected plasticity for final height, number of leaves, and rates of height: growth and leaf production, and genetic variation for plasticity of height growth rate. The ontogenetic reaction norms for leaf number reveal differences among populations and genotypes both in their average (i.e., across environments) ontogenies and in the plastic responses of the ontogenetic trajectories. The ontogenetic reaction norms for plant height, on the other hand, show only a significant Time by Treatment by Genotype effect. The variation among genotypes for both characters can be due to differences in either the rate of growth or its duration. In addition, the same final phenotype may be produced by different ontogenetic trajectories, e.g., rapid early height growth and short duration vs. slower growth and longer duration. The response to selection on plant height or leaf number will depend on the degree of separation in their genetic control and on the amount of genetic variation for these aspects of development. These results suggest that including ontogenetic data in plasticity studies broadens considerably our understanding of how phenotypes may respond to selection and evolve.

AB This study considered the effects of insectivorous Anolis lizards on a large, complex food web of arthropods and associated herbivory in a tropical rain forest canopy. We excluded Anolis lizards for 6 mo from 20-30 m high tree crowns in Puerto Rican rain forest. Simultaneous with lizard exclusion, we sampled orb spiders, airborne arthropods, and leaf arthropods in lizard removal crowns and in controls. We also sampled herbivory at the end of the experiment. Lizard removal had strong, statistically significant, positive effects on arthropods >2 mm in length and weak negative effects on arthropods <2 mm. Parameters of arthropod body size distributions differed between removals and controls for leaf arthropods, but not for airborne arthropods. Among arthropod taxa >2 mm, both predatory, i.e., orb spiders and parasitic Hymenoptera, and nonpredatory forms, i.e., Diptera, Coleoptera, Orthoptera, and Blattaria, showed strong significant and positive responses to lizard removal. Large Psocoptera, Homoptera, leaf spiders, and ants did not show significant overall responses to lizard removal. Frequency of herbivore damage on new leaves was positively correlated with abundance of Orthoptera acid Blattaria. This damage was significantly greater in lizard removal crowns than in controls, indicating an indirect effect of anoles on plants. The indirect effect of lizards on small arthropods through the predatory arthropod pathway appeared weak. Results of lizard removal shown by this study corroborate other lizard removal studies from more xeric, ground-level habitats with simpler food webs in the West Indies, particularly with respect to orb spiders and herbivory. Taken together with the results of similar experiments performed in trophically less complex systems, this experiment suggests that food web size is less important than body size in determining interaction strength between community members.

AB It is hypothesized that mutualistic relationships can be persistent due to a third ''external'' species constraining the otherwise unlimited growth of the mutualists. By consuming mycorrhizal fungi, soil fauna may exert such a control over the development of the plant-fungus symbiosis. In this study I investigated the influence of soil fauna on the mutualistic association of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi and seedlings of birch and pine in transparent experimental microcosms simulating coniferous forest soil. The soil was defaunated, reinoculated with soil microbes, and seedlings of silver birch (Betula pendula) or Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) infected with 3-4 taxa of EM fungi were separately planted in the microcosms. Half of the microcosms were thereafter reinoculated with diverse soil fauna. Microcosms were incubated in a climate chamber with varying illumination and temperature regimes for two annual cycles of the plant. After 57 wk the biomass of EM fungi was significantly reduced in the refaunated microcosms, the amount of fungi on birch and pine roots being 50 and 20%, respectively, of that in the non-refaunated controls. Similarly, the total microbial biomass in the bulk soil was significantly lower in the refaunated systems. The shoot production of both tree species was significantly enhanced in the presence of fauna: by the end of the experiment 1.5 (birch) and 1.7 (pine) times more aboveground biomass was produced in the refaunated microcosms than in the controls. Concentrations of N and P in the foliage of both tree species were also higher in the refaunated microcosms. These data indicate that the obvious reduction in EM fungi due to soil fauna is not harmful for the plant-fungus symbiosis provided that the community composition of the belowground food web is complex enough to ensure efficient mobilization of nutrients in the mycorrhizosphere.

AB Ecological theorists propose that the species composition of trophic levels can influence the relative strengths of top-down (predation) or bottom-up (nutrient) effects in food chains. We tested this by constructing two- and three-level food chains of bacteria and protists. Bacteria made up the first trophic level. The second level contained Chilomonas paramecium alone, Colpidium cf. striatum alone, or both together. Predatory Euplotes patella occupied the third trophic level. These assemblages were cultured in microcosms containing either low- or high-nutrient medium.
   Manipulating nutrients and predation produced comparable changes in the abundance of bacteria. In the second trophic level, Chilomonas was usually driven extinct by predation, but Colpidium was affected more by nutrients than predation because it had a partial size refuge from predation. Both species survived more poorly with predatory Euplotes if the other was present, because the predator was more abundant and persistent when both prey were available. The predator was less persistent in high-nutrient microcosms, because additional nutrients boosted the proportion of Colpidium populations within the size refuge. This type of mechanism could limit trophic cascades in food chains where resources affect prey vulnerability.

AB Competition has been shown to be an important factor in natural systems. Yet, its effect on community structure remains poorly understood and is often disputed. Null models have been employed by researchers in recent years, but these generally suffer from a lack of power estimation and unclear distinction between statistical significance and biological importance, Models that employ an appropriate alternative hypothesis allow for power estimates and for quantitative evaluation of the effects of competition. We have developed methodologies to (1) allow for testing the significance of competition in natural communities, (2) determine the power of these estimates, and (3) produce maximum likelihood estimates of interaction parameters for these communities. Using these methodologies we show that small mammal communities at the interface between Valdivian temperate rain forest and Patagonian steppe in southern South America appear significantly and importantly structured by competition, although we cannot distinguish between resource competition, interference competition, and apparent competition. Secondarily, we show that the geographic origin of the component species (Valdivian vs. Patagonian) is relatively more important than their habitat affinities in structuring these communities.

AB Protandry, the early emergence of males into a seasonally breeding population, has been described mathematically as a mating strategy resulting from sexual selection on both sexes; A key implicit assumption in protandry models is that all matings contribute equally to a male's reproductive success. We build a simulation model of protandry based on field censuses and investigate the consequences of size-specific temporal variation in female fecundity for the optimal timing of protandry in the western treehole mosquito, Aedes sierrensis. We show that theoretical predictions of protandry are robust when differential female fecundity is incorporated into a model of protandry in A. sierrensis. In addition, we utilize field data and laboratory experiments to elucidate the selective forces acting on both sexes of this mosquito. Under conditions of reduced per capita resources, males minimized development time by pupating at lower mass; females maximized mass by delaying pupation. These gender-specific, homeostatic adjustments to food and density, which result in density-dependent protandry, indicate that protandry is the result of selection on independent fitness criteria in each sex.

AB In eusocial Hymenoptera, relatedness asymmetries lead to conflict between parents and offspring over sex investment; workers strive for a 3:1 female-biased ratio of sex allocation, and queens strive for a 1:1 ratio. Many studies support this genetic relatedness hypothesis, but the variation in allocation ratios in natural populations is great and remains mostly unexplained. In this paper, we examined whether food supply determines sex investment of the ant Formica podzolica. We compare reproductive parameters of colonies and populations across habitats, and compare sex allocation of fed and unfed colonies. Nest density, worker size, sex ratio, and sex allocation were all greater along forest edges than in meadows, and these patterns were associated with natural food abundance. Furthermore, there was a strong tendency for individual colonies to produce either all-male or all-female sexuals, and worker size was greatest in colonies producing all females and smallest in those producing all males. Most important, sex investment was greatly affected by a supplemented diet, as the population investment ratio, R (i.e., ratio of males to males plus females), was female biased (0.36) for fed colonies and male biased (0.62) for unfed, control colonies. Finally, investment ratios were more male biased in polygynous than in monogynous colonies as predicted by a genetic relatedness hypothesis. These results demonstrate that food supply has an important proximate influence on sex investment, and may explain much of the natural variation in sex investment in populations of eusocial Hymenoptera.

AB Increased activity rates in larval anurans are associated with both higher growth rates and higher predation mortality. Models of adaptive foraging behavior in the face of predation risk predict that at higher resource levels, foraging activity should be reduced. Thus, at higher resource levels predation mortality should also be reduced. We manipulated the resources available to Rana catesbeiana tadpoles and then measured the activity of tadpoles in the presence of caged dragonfly larvae and the mortality rate of the tadpoles when the dragonflies were free to forage. At low food levels the tadpoles moved more often and more quickly. Similarly, at low food levels the tadpoles suffered higher predation mortality. The dependence of predation mortality on resources available to prey underlines the futility of characterizing population regulation as being due to predation or resources. Adaptive variation in behavior responds to both pressures simultaneously. These results also suggest the possibility that adaptive variation in behavior may lead to density-dependent population regulation. Density-dependent depletion of resources by prey should lead to increased activity levels, which will result in higher per capita predation rates. The generality of the trade-off between growth rate and mortality rate argues that this mechanism may be widespread. If adaptive variation in behavior is as widespread as it appears, incorporating this variation into population dynamic modelling may improve our ability to predict the outcome of interactions within ecological communities.

AB To determine the strength, frequency, and nature of density-dependent processes in natural plant populations, the densities of two perennial grass species, Bouteloua rigidiseta and Aristida longiseta, were perturbed in an otherwise undisturbed community. Both seed additions and adult removals, of each species separately, were used. Individual plant survival, growth, and reproduction were monitored, as well as recruitment to the population and the numbers in each size class of each species, for 5 yr.
   The responses to the experimental perturbations were small relative to the magnitude of the perturbations, indicating that density dependence in demographic parameters in both populations was weak throughout the period. The results therefore do not support the suggestion of Fowler (1986) that the weak density dependence in the Bouteloua rigidiseta population in the ist yr of the experiment was a temporary result of drought.
   Significant responses to the density manipulations were scattered among annual intervals, characters, and replicates. This may be simply a result of testing responses at the limits of detectability, or it may reflect intermittent and scattered density dependence. Density effects were generally much smaller than other differences among quadrats and differences among plants within quadrats, indicating that other factors had much more effect on a plant's fate.

AB Population sizes of insect herbivores on natural plant hybrids may be higher, lower, or intermediate to those on the parent species. I studied the biology and population dynamics of a species of free-living aphid (Pterocallis alni) in a hybrid zone of alder (Alnus sp.). The parent trees were Alnus glutinosa and A. incana and their hybrid was A. pubescens. Hybrid trees differed from parents in phenological and morphological characters. Leaf trichome density on hybrid trees was intermediate to trichome densities on A. glutinosa (high density) and A. incana (low density), and thus appeared to be inherited in an additive manner. High trichome density on A. incana resulted in very high mortality and eventual elimination of aphids colonizing this tree. Aphid populations on the hybrid A. pubescens were higher than on A. incana, but lower than on A. glutinosa. However, aphid susceptibility did not appear to be inherited in a strictly additive fashion, as there was a dominance deviation in favor of the susceptible parent. This lack of additivity in insect resistance was most likely due to a threshold effect of trichome density, with the density on the hybrid species below the level for the tree to be aphid resistant. Population differences on A. gIutinosa and A. pubescens were not caused by differences in growth or reproduction of aphids between hosts. Cage-reared aphids on these two hosts had identical performance in five successive generations. The effect of caging probably reduced wind movement of trichomes and thereby reduced the probability of aphids being dislodged from their feeding site. Predator and parasitoid species responded in a similar manner to the aphids; their numbers were intermediate on the hybrid hosts.

AB Fallen logs in temperate deciduous forests are a transient substrate on which a dozen or more bryophyte species can co-occur. This study aimed to assess whether establishment capabilities and species interactions determine the habitat specificity of these species. I performed a modified Dewit replacement series experiment on three moss species (Anomodan rostratus, typical on bark of hardwood logs; Leucobryum albidum, characteristic of Pinus logs; and Platygyrium repens, a generalist species) in order to evaluate their competitive interactions. The species were grown from leaf fragments sown on four substrates: Pinus bark and wood, and Quercus bark and wood. Substrate had a significant effect on establishment for all three species. However, only on Pinus bark was the frequency dependent on the species sown. Randomization test analogs of analysis of variance indicated that the biomass of Anomodon and Platygyrium grown in monoculture differed significantly across substrates, while that of Leucobryum did not. There was considerable variability in performance within bryophyte species and there was no evidence for significant interactions between pairs of species.

AB We determined the densities of diapausing eggs of the copepod Diaptomus sanguineus in sediments from two small freshwater lakes in Rhode Island. Sediment cores, sliced at 1-cm intervals, showed that egg densities ranged between 4 x 10(4) and 8 X 10(4) eggs/m(2) near the sediment surface and declined to very low values at depths of 10-15 cm in both lakes, although eggs were found as deep as 30 cm in the sediment of one lake. Between 10 and 50% of these eggs hatched in short-term laboratory experiments, and actual egg viability is probably higher. Pb-210-dating revealed relatively constant sedimentation rates in both lakes, and we use this information to estimate egg ages. In one lake, the mean diapausing-egg age is 70.4 yr (median age = 45.9 yr) and the maximum age of eggs we hatched was 332 yr. In the other lake, the mean egg age is 48.9 yr (median age = 35.9 yr) and the maximum age of eggs we hatched was 112 yr. We calculated egg mortality rates by regressing In(egg density) on the age of the sediment from which the eggs were taken to obtain estimates of 1.1 and 1.5% mortality/yr for the two lakes. Diapausing eggs of zooplankton represent a long-lived life history stage of an otherwise short-lived organism. They provide generation overlap that can have substantial significance for both ecological and evolutionary dynamics.

AB Habitat associations of mobile foragers are well documented, but causes behind such patterns are seldom as well defined. Black-throated Green Warblers (Dendroica virens) attain greater densities in red (Picea rubens) than in white spruce (P. glauca) forests in coastal Maine and use red spruce foliage significantly more than predicted on the basis of availability. These habitat associations may be explained best by small-scale differences in vegetation structure, which can influence foraging efficiency. Red spruce have shorter needles held at more acute angles to woody stems than do white spruce. I predicted that D. virens prefers red spruce because of ease of perching and foraging on needles with this structure. Moreover, red spruce preferences should be exaggerated in moist vegetation, since white spruce needle structure and arrangement may wet and reduce plumage insulation capabilities more quickly. Three aviary experiments were performed with D. virens to test the role of structural differences in vegetation on foraging-site and perching-site selection: wetting of vegetation, decreasing white spruce needle angle to resemble red spruce, and reduction of white spruce needle length to approximate red spruce. Moistening of red spruce branches did not affect the foraging or microhabitat use of experimental warblers. Needle angle reduction did not change perching-site preferences, but foraging significantly shifted in favor of white spruce. Needle length manipulations resulted in significantly greater use of white spruce than in controls, for both perching and foraging substrates. The relationships found in this study between individual habitat selection and fine-scale features of habitat structure are consistent with the larger-scale patterns of habitat occupancy seen in this system, and have important implications in understanding habitat requirements for declining forest passerine populations.

AB The goal of this study was to assess whether selection for insecticide resistance resulted in evolutionary change in diapause propensity in the obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana. Caterpillars that diapause under bark in midsummer were assumed to escape exposure to insecticides. Estival larval diapause was modeled as a bet-hedging strategy that reduces the risk of reproductive failure in a stochastic seasonal environment and decreases mortality due to insecticides. The proportion of larvae entering estival diapause in populations within a local geographic area was predicted to increase in orchards treated with insecticides after midsummer. As predicted, insects from populations exposed to insecticides evolved a higher propensity to diapause than individuals from insecticide-free populations. A second prediction of the model was that the proportion of diapause in a population should be negatively correlated with survival of the non-diapausing larvae to insecticides applied after midsummer. This prediction was not supported; there was a positive correlation between diapause propensity and the estimated survival to the insecticides. A simulation model indicated that this unexpected correlation did not result from a non-equilibrium situation in which diapause propensity and physiological resistance evolved at different rates across orchards exposed to different insecticide regimes. A positive across-population correlation between physiological resistance and diapause suggests pleiotropic effects of the resistance allele(s). Such pleiotropic effects could result in a correlated response of diapause following strong directional selection for physiological resistance and may explain the inadequacy of the optimality model to predict the evolutionary trajectory of diapause propensity across the insecticide-treated populations.

AB Fruit availability and its relation to bird abundance at different spatio-temporal scales were examined in olive orchards in southern Spain. Because olive abundance in orchards can be manipulated, this system provides an opportunity to examine the link between populations of fruit-eating birds and fruiting plants in much more detail than possible in natural systems. Olive availability varied in space and time as a result of differences in olive yield and in ripening and harvesting rates. The most abundant frugivorous birds in the orchards (Sylvia atricapilla and Turdus philomelos) were frequently able to track olive availability on both local and regional scales. S. atricapilla showed a response to even small-scale harvesting of olives by humans, distributing itself preferentially in unharvested patches. The ability of both species to track fruit availability may explain their high abundance. Other less abundant frugivores (Erithacus rubecula and S. melanocephala) showed less capacity to track olive availability. I suggest that their inability to respond to rapidly changing patterns of olive abundance may partially account for their scarcity in olive orchards.
   Olive orchards play an important role in maintaining frugivorous bird populations in the Mediterranean area. My data suggest that a key reason for this is great spatial and temporal variability in the availability of olives in orchards, which results in a widely scattered but temporally continuous availability of olives. The capacity of some frugivorous species to track complex spatio-temporal patterns of fruit availability was, I hypothesize, a pre-adaptive feature that allowed them to flourish in the highly modified habitat of southern Spain.

AB We examined the influence of stream water chemistry on relationships between fungal activity and breakdown rates of yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) leaves in eight streams that varied with respect to pH and nutrient (nitrate and phosphate) concentrations. We also performed a reciprocal exchange experiment of leaves that had been colonized by microorganisms in two streams with contrasting water chemistries. Decomposer activity varied greatly depending on the stream in which the leaves were placed. Variation in breakdown rates of yellow poplar leaves was over 9-fold maximum ATP concentrations associated with leaves varied as much as 8-fold, and maximum sporulation rates of fungi associated with leaves varied over 80-fold among streams. Among all streams, nitrate, phosphate, and temperature were positively correlated with one another and with decomposer biomass and activity. When hardwater streams were analyzed separately, nitrate concentration was the only variable that was significantly correlated with all measures of microbial activity and leaf breakdown. Consequently, nitrate concentration appeared to explain much of the variation we detected among streams. Responses to the reciprocal exchange experiment were rapid, with significant changes occurring within the first 5 d after the transfer. Leaves transferred from the hardwater stream containing relatively high concentrations of nitrate and phosphate to the softwater stream containing low concentrations of nutrients exhibited by large decreases in both ATP concentrations and sporulation rates, whereas ATP concentrations and sporulation rates increased when leaves received the reciprocal transfer. The fungi associated with decomposing leaves in streams appear to obtain a significant portion of their nutrients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) from the water passing over the leaf surface. These results indicate that the chemistry of the water can be an important regulator of leaf breakdown in streams by affecting the activity of decomposer fungi.

AB Competition has been widely assumed to be one of the principal mechanisms underlying the resistance of shrub and herbaceous communities to invasion by trees. However, there are potential mechanisms by which low-growing species, particularly in physically stressful sites, could enhance growth or survival of tree seedlings (facilitation). The balance of inhibition and facilitation will determine the net effects of a community on tree seedling growth and survival. We conducted a large-scale field experiment to quantify the net effects of four major physiognomic types (shrub thickets, shrubby grass meadows, grass meadows, and herbaceous meadows) commonly found both in old fields and along utility rights-of-way on the growth and survival of three common tree species: sugar maple (Acer saccharum), red maple (Acer rubrum), and gray birch (Betula populifolia). The eight community types were distributed in 23 sites representative of the range of upland environments present in the Hudson Valley of New York. Growth of planted seedlings of all three tree species was uniformly slow in all of the community types and environments. In all cases, the net effect of intact vegetation was to inhibit the growth of the tree seedlings. The intensity of competition varied substantially among the 23 sites but was not consistently related either to community type or to the biomass of the intact community. Instead, variation in the intensity of competition was related to the underlying favorability of the site for the growth of a particular target tree species. On physically unfavorable sites, tree seedlings grew slowly because of physical stress rather than competition with the intact vegetation. As site quality increased, the intensity of competition increased. Thus, competition and physical stress traded off along a site-quality gradient, with the result that tree seedling growth was uniformly slow. In contrast to the results for growth, there were cases in which the survival of these young tree seedlings was enhanced (facilitated) by the presence of intact vegetation. In particular, survival of the highly shade tolerant but drought intolerant sugar maple seedlings was facilitated by intact vegetation at many sites, especially for the 1988 cohort, which experienced a drought during its first growing season. Since we detected no consistent differences among communities in the intensity of competitive effects on seedling growth, the apparent differences among early successional communities in resistance to tree seedling establishment may be caused by Variation in the duration of competition resulting from differences in height and canopy structure of the low-growing communities.

AB The total foliar area or mass of a tree is difficult to measure, as is its bark or cambial area, and various other components of aboveground biomass. A variety of sampling methods is proposed and estimators of these characteristics are presented. Based on probability precepts, all estimators are unbiased. An unbiased estimator of variance for each estimator also is presented. The basis in probability rather than a fitted regression equation provides some important safeguards, and is a useful alternative when fitted regression functions are unavailable for a particular species and physiographic condition.

AB The study of community dynamics often requires that species be grouped into a smaller number of system components. Species are typically grouped on the basis of their autecological traits (sensu late), but this assumes that autecology is an adequate predictor of species' functional roles in the community. I tested whether autecological similarities correctly predict similarities among species' effects using experimentally reconstructed temporary pond communities. I individually manipulated six taxa (two predators, two herbivorous snails, and two herbivorous tadpoles) to assess the effects of each on a complex background community. The species' effects were all best explained as direct effects of a consumer on its food; no clear evidence of indirect effects was found. The six species could be divided into three statistically distinct groups based on their effects on the background community: ''Ambystoma,'' ''Gambusia,'' and ''herbivores.'' The pattern of similarities among species' effects was well predicted by the pattern of similarities among their autecological traits. The results suggest that, at least over the spatial and temporal scale of this experiment, autecological traits are indeed a useful guide to grouping species for studies of system dynamics.

AB Seasonal variation in reproductive success is a common feature of most organisms. To understand the evolution of breeding seasons and reproductive strategies of individual animals, it is necessary to assess the extent to which seasonal variation in reproductive success is causally related to seasonal variation in the environment ('timing' hypothesis), to differences in quality between early and late breeders or their territories ('quality' hypothesis), or to a combination of both. We manipulated timing of breeding in the Great Tit Parus major, a small passerine, to test these hypotheses. A group of experimentally delayed birds was created by removing first clutches, inducing birds to lay a replacement clutch. Reproductive success of delayed pairs was compared with control pairs that bred early and with pairs that bred late. We conclude that seasonal declines in reproductive success at the nestling stage and survival of adult females were caused by differences in quality between early and late breeders. Recruitment of fledglings into the breeding population and the occurrence of second clutches were causally related to the timing of breeding. The seasonal decline in clutch size was caused by a combination of timing and quality effects. We attempted to assess the relative importance of timing and quality in the seasonal decline in reproductive success, expressed as lifetime production of recruits. We tentatively conclude that 87% of the seasonal decline in lifetime reproductive success could be attributed to a timing effect per se, whereas quality differences between early and late breeders accounted for the remaining 13%.

AB Eleven years of data from experimental nitrogen gradients in three old fields and in native savanna are used to test the hypothesis that similarity of resource availability should influence similarity of plant species composition, Vegetation became less similar on plots that received different amounts of nitrogen, The difference in vegetation between plots was a function of both the difference in added nitrogen and the absolute levels of added nitrogen, Changes in similarity on plots that received the same amount of nitrogen were influenced by initial species composition, the amount of added nitrogen, and the rate of colonization by species not initially present on plots, Replicates of many treatments initially became less similar, only to increase in similarity after 3-6 yr. Data are generally consistent with predictions made in 1988, and clearly illustrate the importance of long-term responses to experimental manipulations.

AB Gunnison's prairie dogs (Cynomys gunnisoni) are social North American ground squirrels whose social system has been shown to vary with food resource distributions, as predicted by the habitat variability-mating system model. We expanded this model to include the effects of variations in population densities, in addition to resource distributions, on both the social system and the individual mating strategies of Gunnison's prairie dogs. Specifically, we predicted that monogamy would be associated with uniform resources, regardless of population density, giving way to polygyny with increasing resource patchiness at intermediate densities, and to multiple males and females at high population densities. In addition, we predicted inbreeding at low densities and outbreeding at high densities on the basis of naturally low levels of genetic heterogeneity in this species. We tested these predictions by comparing social systems and mating strategies at two prairie dog colonies near Flagstaff, Arizona, during a 3-yr period of population increase. We observed variations in sociality to vary in the predicted fashion at both colonies, providing support for the plant patchiness-population density model.

AB The intimate association between a selective herbivore (the chiton Choneplax lata) and its primary prey (the crustose coralline alga Porolithon pachydermum) results in increased biomass and accretion of the alga. This process, over ecological and geological time scales, comprises a major component of Caribbean reef-building systems. Manipulative experiments showed that as the chiton grazes the alga it stimulates new meristematic activity and removes sporlings of the competitively superior frondose and filamentous algae, thereby increasing the survival rate of P. pachydermum on the intertidal reef crest. Furthermore, in the absence of C. into, overgrowths of frondose and filamentous epiphytes provide an attractive food source for parrotfishes (Scaridae), which accelerates bioerosion of the coralline reef-crest structure due to the deep rasping action of feeding activity. Algal removal experiments suggest that the role of P. pachydermum is to provide a predictable food source and refuge substratum, which increases survivorship of the burrowing chiton by minimizing expenditure of energy during foraging and risk to predation.
   The chiton/coralline alga association is abundant throughout tropical western Atlantic islands and augments reef-building processes on the shallow algal crest portion of Caribbean reefs. Cover of the Choneplax/Porolithon association in the Belize Barrier Reef cost averages 13% (maximum to 70%) with a mean chiton density of 664 individuals/m(2) within the association. On average, the extensive networks of interconnected chiton burrows extend between 6 and 10 cm deep and contain one C. lata for every six openings, with the majority of animals (66%) ranging from 16 to 30 mm in length. Gut contents of the chiton consist predominantly of P. pachydermum (51%), followed by bacterial detritus (30%), Cyanophyta (13%), Bacillariophyta (3%), and fleshy microalgae (3%). The close SEM (scanning electron microscope) match between radular morphology of C. lata and grazing scars on the thallus surface of P. pachydermum shows how the chiton regularly feeds on the coralline alga without causing mortality. Virtually all P. pachydermum in the vicinity of C., lata burrows contain radular track scars of approximate to 10 mu m in depth, whereas the photosynthetic, meristematic, and reproductive tissues of the coralline lie below 20 mu m P. pachydermum under intense chiton grazing is photosynthetically competent with 0.1 mg C fixed . g(-1) organic dry mass . h(-1), which is not significantly different from ungrazed material and within the range of rates for other crustose coralline algae. The result is continuous net accretion at a mean rate of 2.3 mm/yr.

AB Several multistratum capture-recapture models were used to test various hypotheses about possible geographic and temporal variation in survival, movement, and recapture/resighting probabilities of 2399 adult Roseate Terns (Sterna dougallii) color-banded from 1988 to 1992 at the sites of the four largest breeding colonies of this species in the northeastern USA. Linear-logistic ultrastructural models also were developed to investigate possible correlates of geographic variation in movement probabilities. Based on goodness-of-fit tests and comparisons of Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) values, the fully parameterized model (Model A) with time- and location-specific survival, movement, and capture probabilities, was selected as the most appropriate model for this metapopulation structure. With almost all movement accounted for, on average >90% of the surviving adults from each colony site returned to the same site the following year. Variations in movement probabilities were more closely associated with the identity of the destination colony site than with either the identity of the colony site of origin or the distance between colony sites. The average annual survival estimates (0.74-0.84) of terns from all four sites indicate a high rate of annual mortality relative to that of other species of marine birds.

AB Little is known about the reproductive ecology of aquatic angiosperms, despite their wide distribution and ecological importance. Surfgrass (Phyllospadix torreyi) is a clonal marine angiosperm that lives on turbulent rocky shores. Surfgrass exhibits a strongly female-biased sex ratio in flowering shoots throughout its distribution along the Pacific coast of North America. The ecological causes for this biased sex ratio were examined over 3 yr in a surfgrass population off Catalina Island in southern California, USA. Abundances, biomass, and C:N content of male and female flowering ramets were measured, and the reproductive phenology, reproductive losses to abortions, herbivore damage to fruits and seeds, and clonal survival and growth were quantified. Each year, a quarter of the vegetative ramets reproduced sexually and seed production in the population was prolific. The population sex ratio was female biased across the entire depth distribution of surfgrass, but males were more abundant deeper in the bed. Despite male rarity, pollen was abundant in the population, and virtually all ovules were fertilized, with few losses to abortions or herbivory before seed release. Potential female fitness (seeds produced) was highest at shallow depths where light availability was greatest and abortions were reduced. The spatial segregation of the sexes was not due to environmental sex lability but to greater ramification of female vs. male clones in shallow depths. Female flowering shoots had significantly higher biomass than males across water depth, despite no obvious cost in terms of vegetative growth, or advantage in terms of plant size. If current theory on sex allocation that the sex ratio should be biased toward the gender with the lower reproductive cost is true for surfgrass, then surfgrass provides an example of how a subtle resource allocation difference can result in a dramatic population bias. An alternative explanation for the female bias in surfgrass populations is greater male mortality due to significantly weaker attachment to the substratum. This study demonstrates the potential role hydrodynamics can play in aquatic plant reproduction and in structuring their populations.

   TERM
AB We assessed the role of growing-season length in regulating absolute and relative cover of six coexisting dominant plant species in an alpine snowbed habitat. To help explain disparity in species-specific responses to growing-season length, we examined the developmental phenology and distribution of each species in relation to natural snow depth variation. Season length varies from approximate to 50 d on early-melting edges of the snowbed to 35 d in the late-melting center, 100 m away. By experimentally altering snowpack, we uncoupled the relationship between spatial location and snowmelt schedule in three consecutive years, imposing the same early dates of snow release in a ''long growing-season'' treatment and the same late dates of snow release in a ''short growing-season'' treatment near the edge and center of the snowbed. Over the course of the experiment, growing-season length had significant effects on absolute and relative cover of the species studied (P < 0.025 and P < 0.005, respectively), and these effects were similar near both the edge and center of the snowbed. Yet, only for the snowbed specialist, Sibbaldia procumbens, were changes in absolute and relative cover under early and late snowmelt schedules predictable from the species' distribution along the historical snow depth gradient. S. procumbens increased in cover under a long growing-season and was more common in historically early-melting portions of the snowbed. Other species (e.g., Ranunculus adoneus, Artemisia scopulorum) were equally common in historically early- and late-melting locations within the snowbed, but showed discordant responses to experimentally imposed changes in snowmelt schedule.
   That the cover of many species under long- vs, short growing seasons was not predictable from their current distributional affinities in relation to snowmelt pattern likely reflects the disparity between the rates of processes exerting long-term control on species' abundances (colonization, soil development) and more immediate effects of growing-season length on plant growth. Consistent with this view, differences in developmental phenology better predicted species-specific responses to snowmelt schedule than distributional affinities. Species having leaf expansion schedules that are poorly synchronized with snowmelt typically had similar cover under early vs. late schedules of snow release (Geum rossii, Trifolium parryi, and Poa alpina). In contrast, species in which leaf expansion schedules are synchronized with snowmelt responded positively to early snow release (Ranunculus adoneus and Sibbaldia procumbens). We hypothesize that maintaining metabolic ''readiness'' under snowcover provides a mechanism for monopolizing nutrient flushes and competitor-free intervals at snowmelt, and exploiting occasional long intervals for growth in years of little snow accumulation, but incurs a respiratory cost that is manifest as reduced growth and vegetative cover when snowmelt is delayed. Our results suggest that interspecific differences in growth phenology of coexisting species will promote shifts in snowbed plant communities with climate change within generations.

AB Previous work has shown that fertilization can mitigate across-year induced resistance among individual Alaska paper birch, supporting the hypothesis that induction results from nutrient deficiency rather than active defense. The present study suggests that fertilization can prevent induction responses in oak within one season, and among leaves within individual trees. Saplings of two oak species, divided among fertilizer treatments within a plantation, were defoliated to varying degrees by a gypsy moth outbreak during spring. We monitored foliage chemistry and insect herbivore distributions during summer and fall of the same year. Damaged leaves within unfertilized Quercus prinus saplings showed increases in foliar astringency and proanthocyanidins. Within fertilized trees, damage did not induce increases in either astringency or proanthocyanidins. Defoliation also induced increases in proanthocyanidins and astringency within Q. rubra saplings, but induction was unaffected by fertilization. On both tree species, the distributions of certain insect guilds were skewed away from damaged leaves on unfertilized trees, but independent of damage on fertilized trees. We suggest that the effects of fertilization on induction can vary among tree species, and can occur at more than one spatial and temporal scale. Our data support the view that nutrient availability may affect phytochemical induction and herbivore responses.

AB Seed dormancy, which is thought to have evolved in response to unpredictable environmental variability, has led to the existence of seed banks-populations of dormant, viable seeds in the soil. Seed banks are theoretically important to both the demography and genetic structure of plant populations. The presence of seed dormancy can also affect the evolution of traits not directly associated with dormancy and germination.
   Theoretical models have suggested that the existence of dormancy can influence the rate of evolution of post-germination traits. The eventual outcome (e,g., allele frequencies) may be influenced as well, leading to adaptive syndromes of germination and post-germination traits. Seeds that germinate in different conditions may experience different selective regimes for post-germination traits. If there an trade-offs between the fitness of post-germination traits in different environments, then seeds that germinate in the environment to which their post-germination traits are adapted will be at a selective advantage. If differences in germination and post-germination traits are genetically based, then potentially adaptive genetic correlations between germination and post-germination traits may evolve. We feel that investigating the ecological and evolutionary importance of these correlations requires an empirical approach. As a first step, hen we ask whether the conditions necessary for such syndromes to arise exist in a particular plant population.
   We show that conditions favoring the joint evolution of dormancy and postgermination traits leading to adaptive syndromes exist in the mustard, Lesquerella fendleri, in central New Mexico. First, Lesquerella experiences the sort of variation in environmental conditions that would be expected to lead to adaptive trade-offs in the expression of post-germination traits for individuals that differ in germination traits, Annual precipitation varies greatly from year to year so that germination in drier years would be expected to select for more xerophytic traits. Within a year, microenvironmental spatial variation exists. Lesquerella growth and reproduction are sensitive to both year-to-year and microenvironmental variation. Second, the seed bank can affect both the demographic and genetic structure of the population. Dormant seeds remain viable for at least 3 yr and can mitigate the negative demographic effects of reproductive failure. Allozyme differences exist between seeds that germinate in the field and seeds that remain dormant, suggesting that the evolutionary potential of the aboveground population is influenced by dormancy. Finally, the necessary genetic and environmental variation is present. Both germination percentage and post-germination traits (e.g., leaf morphology) vary among and within populations as well as among environmental treatments. Thus, the potential exists for Lesquerella to respond to selective differences between different temporal or spatial environments.
   We suggest experimental approaches for assessing the extent to which seed dormancy has affected or will affect the evolution of post-germination traits. The consequences of past evolution could be explored by asking ''What genetic and phenotypic differences exist between individuals that germinate and those that remain dormant?'', while controlling for factors that influence germination (maternal genotype, maternal environment, and germination environment). Exploring whether evolution is currently occurring would require an assessment of natural selection and the genetic potential for response to selection. Given the difficulty of such studies, a reasonable first step would be to explore how evolution can occur by performing an artificial selection experiment on dormancy or germination percentage. Then, correlated responses of post-germination traits could be examined.
   Empirical studies such as these are necessary in order to better understand the role of seed banks in plant ecology and evolution. Then, once associations that can be interpreted as adaptive syndromes are documented, questions about the ecological mechanisms (e.g., necessary frequencies of different year types) and genetic mechanisms (e.g., linkage disequilibrium vs. pleiotropy) can be explored. We hope to draw attention to seed dormancy, which is an often-ignored stage in the life history of plants, and to encourage empirical work, which lags far behind theory.

AB Critical thresholds are transition ranges across which small changes in spatial pattern produce abrupt shifts in ecological responses. Habitat fragmentation provides a familiar example of a critical threshold. As the landscape becomes dissected into smaller parcels of habitat, landscape connectivity-the functional linkage among habitat patches-may suddenly become disrupted, which may have important consequences for the distribution and persistence of populations. Landscape connectivity depends not only on the abundance and spatial patterning of habitat, but also on the habitat specificity and dispersal abilities of species. Habitat specialists with limited dispersal capabilities presumably have a much lower threshold to habitat fragmentation than highly vagile species, which may perceive the landscape as functionally connected across a greater range of fragmentation severity.
   To determine where threshold effects in species' responses to landscape structure are likely to occur, we developed a simulation model modified from percolation theory. Our simulations predicted the distributional patterns of populations in different landscape mosaics? which we tested empirically using two grasshopper species (Orthoptera: Acrididae) that occur in the shortgrass prairie of north-central Colorado. Increasing degree of habitat specialization and dispersal range of a species enhanced the level of aggregation-the degree of clumping exhibited by the population-in our simulations. The landscape threshold at which populations became aggregated was affected by dispersal range for habitat generalists, but not for habitat specialists. Habitat specialists exhibited aggregated populations when preferred habitat occupied <40% of the landscape. Habitat generalists with good dispersal abilities occurred as aggregated populations when <35% of the landscape contained suitable habitat; habitat generalists with limited dispersal only formed patchy distributions when the preferred habitat was a minor (20%) proportion of the habitat. In field tests, a large species of grasshopper (Xanthippus corallipes Haldeman) exhibited reduced rates of travel in two microhabitats that together comprised 35% of a grassland mosaic; a smaller species (Psoloessa delicatula Scudder) had the highest residence time in a rare microhabitat that occurred in only 8% of the landscape. On the basis of our simulation results, we predicted that the large species would be patchily distributed because the abundance of its associated habitat is at the critical threshold. The small species should be unable to aggregate, given the rarity of habitat for which it has an affinity, and thus should be randomly distributed across the landscape. The distribution of these two species in this grassland mosaic matched the predictions from our simulations. By providing quantitative predictions of threshold effects, this modelling approach may prove useful in the formulation of conservation strategies and assessment of land-use changes on species' distributional patterns and persistence.

AB This study examined whether mutualism with different genotypes of nitrogen-fixing symbionts affected relative plant fitness in a natural environment. Amphicarpaea bracteata (Leguminosae) plants from eight populations were paired and transplanted into 86 small plots at a field site. Each 16 cm diameter plot contained three plants from each of two populations, and was inoculated with an isolate of Bradyrhizobium from the native site of one of the two host populations (chosen at random). The total seed biomass produced by plants from each host population within a plot was used as a measure of lifetime reproductive success. For three out of the four sets of paired competitors, there was a highly significant increase in relative fitness when plants grew in the presence of a Bradyrhizobium isolate from their native population. On average, substituting a native for a non-native bacterial genotype caused a 39% increase in seed biomass per plant (range among eight populations, -13% to +182%). These results indicate that differential compatibility of host and symbiont genotypes can be a significant factor controlling the fitness of competing plants in nature.

AB In cases of successful biological control the pest population is maintained at low densities by a natural enemy, but the mechanisms by which the predator or parasitoid manages to control the pest are often unknown. This study was undertaken to determine the response of a predator to different population growth rates of its prey within a biological control system. Population growth rate of the phytophagous mite Panonychus ulmi was varied by altering the nutritional status of the host plant (apple trees [Pyrus malus]). NPK fertilizer was added to the soil, resulting in higher nitrogen, lower phosphorus, and lower potassium levels in the foliage of the trees. There appeared to be a nonlinear relationship between nitrogen and P. ulmi densities, with density increasing and then decreasing as nitrogen concentration was increased. Two predaceous mites, Tyhladromus pyri and Zetzellia mall, were implicated in the control of P. ulmi, but the effectiveness of both was reduced at high nitrogen levels. The predators therefore did not fully compensate for increases in the population growth rate of their prey, although P. ulmi densities were maintained well below the economic threshold in all cases. However, the probability of persistence of the prey populations was not significantly affected by the nutrient regimes, suggesting that the fundamental dynamics of the predator-prey interaction were not altered by the range of population growth rates in this study.

AB Short time series are common in environmental and ecological studies. For sample sizes of 10 to 50, I examined the performance of methods for adjusting confidence intervals of the mean and parameters of a linear regression for autocorrelation. Similar analyses are common in econometric studies, and serious concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the common adjustment approaches, especially for estimating the slope of a linear regression when the explanatory variable has a time trend. Use of a bias-corrected estimate of the autocorrelation, either in an adjusted t test or in a two-stage approach, outperformed other methods, including maximum likelihood and bootstrap estimators, in terms of confidence interval coverage. The bias correction was, however, sometimes awkward to apply. It was generally better to test for autocorrelation at the 0.5 level and use ordinary least squares if the test was not significant, although this pretesting mainly helped for weak autocorrelation and small sample sizes. For the best methods, the coverage was sometimes still substantially less than the stated 95% when autocorrelation was strong, even for sample sizes as large as 50. This was true for estimates of the mean, the regression intercept, and, when the explanatory variable had a time trend, the slope. Simulation results and an example show that different adjustment methods can produce substantially different estimates and confidence intervals. Cautious interpretation of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests is recommended.

AB In many colonial waterbirds, reproductive success is affected by water levels around the colonies. In a study of the Greater Flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber roseus) in the Camargue, southern France, we examined annual variation in water levels around the breeding colony site between 1984 and 1991 in relation to (1) the number of breeding pairs, (2) colony productivity (fledglings per breeding pair), and (3) physical condition of fledglings. The number of breeding pairs each year was highly variable and was positively correlated with high water levels during the March-July period. There was no significant relationship between the number of breeding pairs and the number of chicks fledged. Although the productivity of the colony was not affected by water levels during the chick-raising period, fledglings were heavier in years with high water levels. There was no relationship between colony productivity or the absolute number of chicks fledged and the average body condition of chicks in the creche. Differences between the 1984 and 1985 cohorts in the frequency of young birds making breeding attempts (i.e., ages 5 and 6 yr) suggested that body condition at fledging may have important life history consequences. Estimation of reproductive performance in colonial waterbirds, usually limited to the average nest productivity, could be improved by considering average body condition of chicks at fledging as well.

AB The relationships between annual wood tissue delta(13)C, growing season soil water potential, and basal area growth were studied in a mature, white pine (Pinus strobus) stand at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, in western North Carolina. In 1992, four bole-wood cores that spanned the years from 1980 to 1989 were extracted from each of ten equal-size, co-dominant white pine trees within the stand. The 1980s were a time of extreme climate with some of the hottest, driest, and wettest years recorded at Coweeta. Annual basal area growth ranged from 14.5 to 25.0 cm(2) . tree(-1). yr(-1), and modeled values of average growing season soil water potential ranged from -0.21 to -5.58 MPa, when measured to a depth of 60 cm. After correcting annual wood tissue delta(13)C for atmospheric changes in delta(13)C, carbon isotopic discrimination (Delta) ranged from 18.52 to 19.62 parts per thousand. The Delta of annual wood tissue was positively correlated with average growing season soil water potential (r(2) = 0.74, P = 0.0005, n = 10 growing seasons) and average annual basal area growth (r(2) = 0.78, P = 0.0002, n = 10 seasons). Basal area growth and growing season soil water potential were also correlated (r(2) = 0.64, P = 0.002, n = 10 seasons). These results suggest that annual wood tissue delta(13)C could potentially be useful in estimating historic changes in soil water potential and basal area growth in mature forest ecosystems.

AB Diseases and pathogens are receiving increasing recognition as sources of mortality in animal populations. Immune system strength is clearly important in fending off pathogen attack. Physical barriers to pathogen entry are also important. Various individual behaviors are efficacious in reducing contact with diseases and pests. This paper focuses on a fourth mode of defense: social barriers to transmission. Various social behaviors have pathogen transmission consequences. Selective pressures on these social behaviors may therefore exist. Effects on pathogen transmission of mating strategies, social avoidance, group size, group isolation, and other behaviors are explored. It is concluded that many of these behaviors may have been affected by selection pressures to reduce transmission of pathogens.

AB Plant size may be an important determinant of competitive ability and may affect comparisons of competitive response among species. We examined the influence of initial size on plant competitive response in a field experiment using transplants in three classes of initial mass (class means: 27, 46, and 73 mg) for each of six species (Agropyron cristatum, Bouteloua gracilis, Elaeagnus commutata, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Melilotus officinalis, and Potentilla pensylvanica), Transplants were grown for one summer in an old field dominated by the perennial grass Bromus inermis. The transplants were grown with no neighbors present, with shoots of neighbors present, with roots of neighbors present, or with both shoots and roots of neighbors present. The existing Bromus served as neighbors. There were 10 replicates of each factor combination. Final transplant mass varied significantly with competition, species identity, and initial size. The mass of transplants grown with only neighbor roots was not significantly different from the mass of transplants grown with both roots and shoots of neighbors, suggesting that competition in the field was primarily belowground. A significant interaction between species identity and competition indicated that species differed in the extent to which they were suppressed by neighbors. There was no significant interaction between size and competition, however, suggesting that initial size had no influence on competitive response. Further, regressions of final transplant mass against neighbor mass provided no evidence that initially smaller transplants were weaker competitors. Our results suggest that the competitive responses of the six species during the first summer of growth were not influenced by their initial size under conditions of intense belowground competition.

AB I used published data to test three possible relationships between the allocation of energy to growth (P) and respiration (R) in chicks: (1) a negative relationship stemming from a trade-off between increased allocation for one purpose, resulting in a reduced proportion of energy available for other purposes; (2) a lack of relationship between P and R; and (3) a positive relationship reflecting functional metabolic coupling of P and R. I restricted my analysis to three periods of the chick's postembryonic development, during which the conflict between allocation of energy to P vs. R is most likely to occur: (a) when the greatest proportion of assimilated energy is allocated to growth; (b) when growth rate (in grams per day), or (c) energy allocated to growth (in kilojoules per day) are at absolute maxima. I analyzed the correlation between P and R after accounting for differences in body mass, costs of biosynthesis, mode of development, breeding latitude, and phylogeny. Under assumption of production efficiency of 0.75, the correlations were negative for periods (a) and (b), and statistically insignificant for period (c). When production efficiency of 0.9 was assumed, the correlation remained negative only for period (c), and became statistically insignificant for the other two. I also found that the positive correlation between growth rate and metabolic rate reported by Klaassen and Drent (1991) becomes insignificant when the effect of breeding latitude is removed from their data set. Thus, the results of all analyses support (1) or (2), rather than (3). I conclude that predictions stemming from (1-3) can often be difficult to distinguish, which may account for the inconsistency between the results of different studies in which the relationship between P and R was analyzed.

AB The power function model S = CA(z) of the species-area relation has a number of shortcomings: it is unbounded, is unable to deal with islands with zero species, and is inappropriate to the known sampling distribution of S. Using only the ''null'' assumption that species are randomly allocated to areas, I propose an extreme-value function (EVF) model of the species-area relation derived from Coleman's theory of random placement. This model accords with empirical and theoretical results that have called into question the accuracy of the power function model at large areas, and resolves two dilemmas in the power function model: the lack of any bound to species number, and heteroscedasticity in the sampling distribution of species number. The model is also able to deal with islands with zero species, without modification. The EVF is comparable to the power function model over most practical ranges of island sizes, but has properties that make it superior to the power function model. The EVF model also provides a logical synthesis of single-species incidence and multiple-species models, and as a model of single-species incidence has parameters with biological meaning.

AB We investigated experimentally how presence or absence of different piscivores influenced habitat use, diet, and individual growth of two size classes of juvenile perch (Perca fluviatilis) and abundances of juvenile perch resources in different habitats. Pond enclosures encompassed 3 X 6 m of dense vegetation and 9 X 6 m of open habitat, and were stocked with 75 young-of-year and 30 1-yr-old perch and with either three piscivorous perch, three northern pike (Esox lucius), or no piscivores. Northern pike were both larger and possessed a larger gape than piscivorous perch. To isolate behavioral responses of juvenile perch to piscivores, we replaced consumed young-of-year perch.
   Prey fish mortality was lowest without piscivores and highest with northern pike. Young-of-year perch increased their use of vegetation in the presence of both piscivores, whereas 1-yr-old perch increased their use of vegetation only with northern pike. For both age classes of prey fish, increased use of the vegetation led to reduced individual growth, owing to two complementary mechanisms. First, the physical complexity of submerged macrophytes likely interfered with the benthic feeding of perch, Second, increased use of the (relatively small) vegetated habitat increased the mean density experienced by prey fish.
   Piscivore-induced changes of prey fish densities in the two habitats had substantial effects on the biomass of prey fish resources in the open habitat, but only minor effects in the vegetation. Sialis lutaria, the major predatory macroinvertebrate (approximate to 50% of total macroinvertebrate biomass in the open habitat), and total predatory macroinvertebrates were positively affected by piscivores in the open habitat, but not in the vegetation. Chironomids (<3% of total macroinvertebrate biomass in the vegetation) and the sizes of nonpredatory macroinvertebrates were negatively affected by piscivores in the vegetation, but not in the open habitat. Biomass of nonpredatory macroinvertebrates, Cladocera, and Copepoda did not differ among treatments in either habitat. From our review of field experiments, vulnerable prey fish always change their habitat use in the presence of piscivores. Behaviorally mediated indirect effects of piscivores on individual growth rates and prey fish resources were just as frequently observed as direct effects of piscivores on prey fish survival.

AB Females of many insects possess an ovipositor, which in crickets is usually used to place eggs deep into the soil. Ovipositor length in female striped ground crickets (Allonemobius socius) increased at higher latitudes and altitudes in North America, despite an opposing trend in overall body size. Crickets inhabiting regions with short growing seasons and long, cold winters invariably had longer ovipositors than crickets inhabiting warmer regions. The only exception to this observation was for first generation crickets in bivoltine populations where there was no pattern of geographic variation in ovipositor length. However, second generation females from these same populations always had longer ovipositors than their first generation ancestors, and followed a pattern of geographic variation similar to that found for univoltine crickets. Overall, these results support Masaki's (1986) model, which predicts that longer ovipositors will evolve in northern cricket populations as an evolutionary response to the selective advantages of overwintering eggs being oviposited deep in the soil in cold habitats.
   In order to determine the mechanisms underlying patterns of phenotypic variation in the wild, and to test the hypothesis that interpopulation variation reflects genetic differentiation while intergeneration variation within a population reflects environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity, crickets from eight populations were brought to the laboratory and reared through three generations in a common garden. It was found that laboratory-reared populations varied significantly in ovipositor length, with the pattern of variation mimicking that found for field-collected crickets. This finding supports the hypothesis that geographic variation in the wild has a significant genetic basis. The influence of environment on ovipositor length was examined in 20 full-sib families from a bivoltine population. Crickets reared in ''autumn-like'' conditions (30 degrees C, 15:9 h, L:D), such as might be experienced by second generation bivoltine crickets in the wild, were generally larger and had significantly longer ovipositors than siblings reared under ''spring-like'' conditions (27 degrees C, 11:13 h, L:D). This pattern corresponds to that observed for bivoltine populations in the wild and suggests the importance of environmental cues for phenotypic plasticity, or polyphenism in ovipositor length in bivoltine populations of this cricket.

AB The C-4 African grass, Pennisetum setaceum (fountaingrass), has a greater altitudinal distribution than any other grass on the island of Hawaii. Clones of P. setaceum were reciprocally transplanted among coastal dry grassland, montane dry shrubland, and subalpine dry forest sites on the leeward side of Hawaii to evaluate the contribution of local adaptation and individual tolerance to the broad ecological amplitude of this grass. Physiological, growth, and reproductive responses differed among sites without evidence of local adaptation. Greatest tiller production and the highest photosynthetic rates were observed at the mid-altitude site, but plants at the coastal site attained greater basal areas, aboveground biomass, and number of inflorescences. Correlation among the responses of different plant characters was environmentally dependent, suggesting that the integrated expression of these characters is also plastic. Few differences in plant responses, however, were attributable to a population's origin or the site-by-population interaction; resident populations and introduced populations responded similarly at each site. Furthermore, few characters exhibited variation among clones, indicating that these populations likely possess little genetic variation. Limited clonal variation was, however, detected for net photosynthesis, the ratio of internal to ambient CO2 concentration (c(i)/c(a)), and specific leaf area, but only on two of five dates over a 1-yr period. Phenotypic plasticity for both individual characters and the integration of physiological and morphological characters have apparently been most important in allowing P. setaceum to become dominant across diverse habitats on Hawaii.

AB We conducted three experiments in which we applied additional hand pollination, flower removal, and leaf removal treatments in Various combinations to Primula veris, a perennial spring-flowering rosette species. The purpose of the study was to determine whether the seed set of Primula veris was limited by pollen availability or by other resources, and whether there were measurable costs of reproduction.
   Hand pollination in the beginning of experiments significantly increased current seed set in only one of the three experiments. It also increased the next-year fruiting probability in that first experiment. In the second experiment, hand pollination did not significantly affect current seed set, but we nevertheless observed enhanced leaf growth in the treatment year and the two following years, and increased flowering frequency, fruiting frequency, and survival in the two following years. In the third experiment, after hand pollination we observed a higher net photosynthetic capacity of the leaves and, again, increased leaf growth in the treatment year and a higher flowering probability in the following year. The positive effect of hand pollination was even clearer when the leaves of the plants were removed at the beginning of the experiment. However, the treatment in which all the flowers were removed had effects on subsequent performance similar to those of the hand-pollination treatment, suggesting trade-offs.
   Thus, we did not observe any costs associated with reproduction after supplemental hand pollination; on the contrary, hand pollination resulted in increased survival, size, and reproduction of the plants in the subsequent years.

AB The limnological effects of natural forest disturbance and succession were studied by analyzing the chemistry, charcoal, pollen, chrysophytes, and diatoms in sediments deposited from approximate to 3500 to approximate to 700 yr BP in Mud Pond, Maine, USA. Mud Pond was chosen for this study because its oligotrophy (mean chlorophyll a = 0.5 mu g/L), large ratio of catchment area to lake area (approximate to 50:1), and steeply sloping catchment (approximate to 12%) are likely to make the lake unusually sensitive to the terrestrial environment. Fine-grained sediments rich in organic matter are interrupted every 100-500 yr ((X) over bar = 280) by coarser and more minerogenic sediments, reflecting brief pulses of soil erosion. These disturbance horizons contain high concentrations of charcoal, indicating forest fires, low percentages of pollen of late-successional trees such as Tsuga, and high percentages of pollen and spores of early-successional plants such as shrubs and ferns. Within a few decades, pollen percentages of Alnus peak, followed by Betula. Tsuga pollen percentages increase for roughly 200-400 yr after disturbances, and generally stabilize or decrease several decades before the following disturbance horizon. Limnological responses to these terrestrial changes are indicated at disturbance horizons by high percentages of diatoms (e.g., Rhizosolenia sp., Fragilaria spp., and Synedra spp.) and chrysophytes (e.g., Synura spinosa and Mallomonas caudata) of waters of near neutral pH. Diatom-inferred pH typically increases abruptly from approximate to 5.0 to approximate to 6.1, and chrysophyte-inferred PPI from approximate to 5.5 to approximate to 5.8 at disturbance horizons. These increases may be caused by increased inputs of wood ash and mineral soils rich in base cations after fires or other disturbances. This pulse is followed by a two-step recovery. First, within a few years or a few decades, the inferred pH decreases nearly to the predisturbance condition as pH-circumneutral diatoms are replaced by taxa of waters of pH less than or equal to 5.5 (e.g., Asterionella ralfsii var. americana, and Eunotia spp.) and pH-circumneutral chrysophytes are replaced by taxa of waters of pH less than or equal to 6.0 (largely Mallomonas allorgei and M. duerrschmidtiae). This response likely results from soil stabilization and uptake of base cations by successional vegetation. Second, a slower acidification of approximate to 0.1 pH unit per century occurs as early successional shrubs and hardwood forest are replaced by old-growth conifer forest. This process may involve further sequestration of base cations in vegetation, and greater availability of organic acids from the forest floor Increasing percentages of pollen of Picea, Alnus, and Salix by 1350 yr BP, and decreasing percentages of hemlock and beech around 1350 yr BP imply cooler conditions. Large changes in diatom and chrysophyte assemblages in approximately this period may be related.

AB Models of annual plants with a persistent seed bank have shown that temporal variation can promote coexistence if the reproductive success of species is favored in different environments determined by temporally variable conditions. This study investigates whether this mechanism may explain the coexistence of three Sonoran Desert species (Pectocarya recurvata, Plantago patagonica, Schismus barbatus). In a 2-yr experiment, factors that vary across years (water and seedling density) were manipulated. In addition, the dominant spatial feature, presence or absence of Larrea cover, was also included as a factor. Our aim was to document fitness hierarchies in different types of years. Seedlings were mapped monthly for survival and reproductive success. To compare species, we used 10 yr of data to calculate the average value that seeds of different species have for population growth. Shifts in fitness hierarchies were found for two species pairs (Pectocarya-Schismus and Pectocarya-Plantago), depending on density and either the year or the water level. Surprisingly, all species had higher survival at higher densities in one or another treatment. Habitats were not important to the fitness hierarchies; all species had higher mean survival and fitness in the open than under shrubs.

AB Divergent natural selection for efficient exploitation of alternative resources is thought to be a primary cause of adaptive radiation. I transplanted two recently diverged stickleback species (Gasterosteus sp.) and their Hybrids between habitats to test three predictions of this hypothesis: (1) the form of natural selection on feeding traits should differ between resource environments; (2) fitness trade-offs should occur between morphs specialized for different resources; (3) feeding efficiency should be the basis of fitness differences between morphs. Growth rate was used as a surrogate component of fitness. All three predictions were upheld. The larger of the two species (the Benthic), which has a larger mouth, deeper body, and fewer, shorter gill rakers than the second species (the Limnetic), had a twofold growth advantage in the littoral zone of the lake. This pattern was reversed in the open-water habitat, where the Limnetic species grew at double the rate of the Benthic. Hybrids, which are morphologically intermediate, tended to be intermediate in growth in both habitats. Growth rates were closely predicted by earlier laboratory measurements of feeding efficiency of the three forms in the same habitats, thus linking growth (and probably fitness) with feeding performance and morphology. I compare the strengths of the present approach with other methods that have been used to test the role of resources in adaptive radiation. I also argue that steep trade-offs in fitness along the littoral-open-water habitat gradient have two further consequences. First, they may cause Hybrids to have low fitness, allowing Benthics and Limnetics to coexist in the absence of perfect premating isolation between them. Second, they may promote ecological character displacement. Steep trade-offs may thus help explain why divergence along the littoral-open-water gradient is so common in fish that have colonized low-diversity lakes.

AB It is known that plants can create acceptable environments for other plant species that may be unable to physiologically adjust to harsh physical conditions in isolation. In this study, we explore the morphological and physiological responses of a positive interaction on a common New England salt marsh shrub, Iva frutescens L. In previous experiments, we have shown that Iva benefits from the presence of the black rush, Juncus gerardi Loisel. Juncus removal in the lower marsh caused increases in soil salinity and anoxia, which resulted in lower Iva biomass, growth, and survival. We hypothesize that the positive effect of Juncus on Iva is a consequence of (1) the turf morphology of Juncus shading soil surfaces, thereby minimizing salt accumulation, and (2) the increased soil oxygen content surrounding Juncus caused by radial oxygen loss from its rhizosphere. However, the specific morphological and physiological benefits conferred on Iva are unknown.
   We conducted experiments in the salt marsh to isolate the effects of Juncus neighbors, waterlogging, and salt water stress on Iva. We found that Iva, when exposed to salty, oxygen-deprived soil conditions created in the absence of Juncus, responded more negatively to salinity than waterlogging, although the interaction between salinity and waterlogging was often significant. Iva without neighbors showed decreases in plant height, leaf density, leaf area, and flower density compared to controls or plants with fresh-water additions. Leaves of Iva without neighbors responded to salt stress and waterlogging by increasing leaf thickness and succulence.
   The increase in soil salinity of plants without neighbors caused plants to have correspondingly low water potentials, indicating that they were severely water stressed. Physiologically, Iva plants had a low mean photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, water-use efficiency, acid stomatal conductance compared to controls or Iva with fresh-water additions. Low water-use efficiency in Iva without neighbors was correlated with stomatal closure but also with high intercellular CO2 concentrations. The mechanisms behind this apparent anomaly may include both nonstomatal inhibition of photosynthesis as well as patchy stomatal closure, although it is uncertain which predominates from our data.
   Our results show that the presence of Juncus, with its superior ability to withstand waterlogging and salt stress, can create a hospitable environment for Iva, extending its distribution to lower intertidal habitats in which it does not have the morphological or physiological plasticity to normally cope.

AB The density of woody plants has increased in grasslands throughout the world, but the cause has been elusive, although changes in herbivory seem central. In this study, the importance of relative time of planting and clipping of Bouteloua curtipendula, a C-4 grass, on Prosopis glandulosa, a woody seedling, was evaluated in a 2-yr field study in central Texas, USA. Secondarily, effects of planting date, presence of the woody seedling, and clipping of the grass on the growth of the grass were evaluated. Relative growth rates (RGRs) of Prosopis glandulosa (honey mesquite) seedlings grown alone were seasonal, generally high in spring and decreasing as summer progressed. When P. glandulosa was planted earlier than Bouteloua curtipendula (side-oats grama), the grass had little or no effect on the woody seedling RGRs. However, the dry mass of P. glandulosa increased 2.3 times when the grass was clipped but was reduced 54% when the grass was unclipped. When the two species were started at the same time and the grass was not clipped, P. glandulosa RGRs decreased and remained zero over the 2 yr, dry mass was reduced 99.8%, and mortality was 80%. If both species were started at the same time and the grass was clipped, 1st- and 2nd-yr growth of P. glandulosa was comparable to that of seedlings grown alone; however dry mass was reduced 79%. When planted later than the clipped grass, dry mass of P. glandulosa was reduced 98% compared to dry mass when planted alone, while in unclipped plots there was 100% mortality. When B. curtipendula was planted early in the growing season, clipping increased aboveground grass dry mass 1.63 times; there was no increase when the grass was planted late. Evidence suggests that woody seedling growth in undisturbed C-4 grasslands would be very limited, and establishment requires gap formation.

AB We present a dynamic model to examine sequential foraging decisions of predators searching for cryptic prey. We identify key elements of information processing and ecological factors determining the costs and benefits of two foraging alternatives. On the one hand, specializing on a single prey type while ignoring other types increases the distance a forager must move; this involves increased energy and time expenditures. On the other hand, switching between searching for several prey types has the obvious cost of an initial reduction in the probability of detecting prey immediately after switching. Switching also has the less apparent cost of a forager's reduced ability to assess the probability of prey presence. We show that if the cost of switching is sufficiently high, and a forager estimates that one prey type is more common than others, then the forager should search for this prey only, unless conditions change.

AB Through plasticity in traits controlling clonal morphology, clonal plants pos sess the potential to selectively place ramets within a heterogeneous environment or ''forage.'' Although many studies document plant responses that are consistent with foraging, few studies test directly whether plants can preferentially locate ''good'' patches or avoid ''bad'' patches when grown in a heterogeneous environment. We conducted such a test for Hydrocotyle bonariensis, a clonal dune species that inhabits soils known to be extremely patchy in both time and space. We subjected Hydrocotyle to a temporally constant but spatially variable soil resource environment created by clipped patches of grass. Clonal morphology in the patch treatment was compared to that in two homogeneous treatments: no grass and full grass. in order to predict the effect of our treatments on the long-term expansion of clones, we calibrated diffusion models of clonal growth with data on the morphological response of Hydrocotyle to our treatments.
   Clones of Hydrocotyle bonariensis were able to respond to the presence of patches by selectively placing ramets outside of grass patches, thus providing direct evidence of an effective foraging response. For each of the three traits identified as potentially contributing to an overall foraging response (branching, internode distance, and direction of rhizome growth), the response in and out of grass patches was substantially different from the degree of plasticity manifested by the two homogeneous treatments. For example, no difference in main rhizome internode lengths was found between the two homogeneous treatments. In contrast, ramets in the heterogeneous (patchy grass) treatment responded to their local environment by increasing internode lengths when in the unfavorable (grass patch) portion of the environment. Empirically calculated diffusion models indicate that habitat complexity has considerable impact on the long-term expansion of clones: only in the heterogeneous treatment did clones expand less rapidly in favorable habitat than they did in unfavorable habitat. In the heterogeneous treatment, Hydrocotyle rhizomes exhibited a previously undocumented behavior: they appeared to veer away from patches of grass. Finally, we discuss how the foraging response of Hydrocotyle ramets may be enhanced by its previously documented capacity for resource integration.

AB The roles of nitrogen availability and seasonality in controlling monoterpene concentration in and emission from Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) were examined in a greenhouse study. Plants were maintained at three nitrogen levels, and foliar nitrogen concentration, photosynthetic rate, monoterpene concentration, and monoterpene emission rate were measured over an entire phenological cycle, from before bud break in the spring through winter dormancy. Both nitrogen fertilization level and phenological stage affected the concentration of monoterpenes in the foliage. There was also a consistent linear relationship between monoterpene concentration and monoterpene emission. Out of the nitrogen-phenology-concentration and the concentration-emission relationships comes a predictable relationship between nitrogen, phenology and monoterpene emission, This relationship allows linkage between atmospheric chemical processes, such as ozone production, and ecological ones, such as leaf expansion. The results also demonstrate that theories on allocation to defense need to consider the phenological stage of the plant as well as the availability of resources.

AB Large-seeded plant species tend to be restricted to late-seral and mature forests, yet the reason for this habitat specificity is often not understood. The typical absence of these species from younger forests may be due to either their ineffective seed dispersal to early-seral habitats or ''postdispersal'' factors such as life history traits and physical and biotic variables, or both. Two large-seeded palm species, Iriartea deltoidea and Astrocaryum murumuru var. javarense, were used to experimentally evaluate the role of postdispersal limitation by testing whether the species exhibit differential seedling survivorship in forest stands of different ages.
   Under natural conditions, both palm species are largely absent from early- and mid-seral floodplain forest but are common in late-seral and mature forest. Iriartea seedlings and juveniles are found occasionally in early- and mid-seral forest, whereas Astrocaryum are almost never found there. To assess the degree to which postdispersal factors could account for these patterns, seeds of the two palm species were transplanted into four zones in the successional floodplain forest of Manu National Park, Peru. Three experiments quantifying seedling establishment and survivorship were carried out: a 3-yr experiment using Iriartea, in which flooding during the Ist yr was lower than average (Iriartea Dry Experiment); a l-yr experiment using Iriartea, in which flooding during the Ist yr was higher than average (Iriartea Wet Experiment); and a 2-yr experiment using Astrocaryum, in which flooding during the Ist yr was also higher than average (Astrocaryum Wet Experiment). For each experiment, four or five plots, each containing 75 seeds, were placed in each of four zones from early to late succession. The entire design was replicated in two successional transects that were separated by 6 km.
   Seedling survivorship of Astrocaryum was highest in the late-seral zones of both transects, which corresponded closely to its restricted natural distribution. Hence, postdispersal limitations, perhaps in conjunction with restricted seed dispersal, apparently contributed heavily to the general absence of Astrocaryum from the early- and mid-seral floodplain forests. Flooding did not appear to influence Astrocaryum seedling survivorship.
   Postdispersal factors also seemed to influence strongly Iriartea establishment, as evidenced by the significant variation in seedling survivorship across seral zones and between transects. Moreover, in the Iriartea Dry Experiment, seedling survivorship was negatively correlated with level of flooding. During the Iriartea Wet Experiment, survivorship was substantially lower in all seral zones, probably due to the heavy flooding. Thus, flooding, as a postdispersal factor, appeared to pray a major role in shaping the natural distribution of Iriartea in the successional floodplain forests. Because seedling survivorship in one mid-seral zone was substantially higher than would be predicted from the natural Iriartea seedling density, results from transplant experiments also suggest that limited seed dispersal may contribute to this palm's early-seral distribution. For Iriartea, seed dispersal limitation may play a role complementary to that of flooding.
   In Amazonian primary-successional floodplain forest, the habitat specificity of at least one, and perhaps two, large-seeded species appears to result from both dispersal limitation and postdispersal limitation factors.

AB The trophic ecology of 11 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa found in Cache Creek, Yellowstone National Park (YNP) was studied to determine if burned organic matter is an important resource and how resource utilization patterns may be altered in post-fire streams. Laboratory food quality experiments were conducted to determine the growth response of each species when grown on several resource types: burned organic matter, periphyton, unburned coarse particulate material (CPM), and unburned fine particulate material (FPM). The central hypothesis of this research was that benthic macroinvertebrates cannot use burned organic matter as a resource. A secondary hypothesis was that some benthic macroinvertebrates are facultative in trophic function, with the ability to use both allochthonous and autochthonous resources for growth.
   Of the 11 taxa studied, only one (Paraleptophlebia heteronea) could grow on burned organic matter as a resource, indicating that post-fire food webs probably do not exhibit major shifts in resource utilization to burned material. Two species were generalist detritivores (P. heteronea, Ameletus cooki) able to use both natural FPM and CPM resources. Two species were specialist detritivores (Oligophlebodes sigma, Ephemerella infrequens) growing only on unburned CPM resources, and two (Cinygmula mimus, Epeorus albertae) were specialist herbivores utilizing only periphyton. Five species were generalist herbivore-detritivores (Baetis bicaudatus, Drunella doddsi, D. coloradensis, D. spinifera, Zapada columbiana), exhibiting growth on both detritus and periphyton resources.
   Based on the experimental results, trophic generalists are common food web components in Yellowstone streams. Two Of the most abundant benthic macroinvertebrates during postfire recovery, B. bicaudatus and Z. columbiana, were trophic generalists, indicating that some generalists may be disturbance adapted. In this study, published functional feeding group classification did not indicate obligate resource utilization (growth on only one resource type) for most taxa studied. Comparison of a food web for Cache Creek based on functional feeding group classification and one based on the results of this study indicates that the inclusion of generalists in the web results in a more realistic approximation of food web relationships such as the link-species scaling law. Our results suggest that future research should include spatial and temporal aspects of resource switching and generalist resource utilization by individual lotic primary consumers.

AB The null hypothesis that the proportions or relative abundance among j mutually exclusive categories (e.g., species or sizes) is the same for two or more populations (e.g., locations or sexes, respectively) is often tested with the Pearson chi-square goodness of-fit statistic. The chi-square statistic is derived under the assumption that the objects counted are independently and identically distributed. Count data from samples of clusters or groups of objects, for example, with transects, grabs, trawls, and quadrats usually fail to meet these assumptions, Many articles appear in the ecological literature that fail to realize the implications of violating the assumptions implicit in the use of the chi-square distribution test of homogeneity of proportions. Species aggregation, alone and in combination with increased mean abundance, and a large number of categories are shown to increase Type I error rates. Pooling several samples to get a representative sample does not solve the problem for < 14 replicate samples for ecologically plausible levels of aggregation. An easily implemented solution is suggested.

AB Trade-offs between mortality and reproduction play a central role in theories of life history and of senescence. Yet the fundamental question of how reproduction affects mortality is unresolved. We simultaneously manipulated both egg production and adult food availability in the beetle Callosobruchus maculatus and measured their effects on age-specific mortality. We show that there are two distinct mortality trade-offs of egg production. An early trade-off is observed at ages <18 d and is conditional on current adult nutrition; it is potentially related to energy exhaustion. The late trade-off is observed after 20 d of age, is progressive, and occurs despite the availability of current adult diet; it is potentially related to senescence. The expression of both mortality trade-offs depends on the interaction of early reproduction and nutritional state at the time of reproduction. Food availability at the time of high egg production completely mitigates the early mortality trade-off and lowers the late mortality trade-off by approximate to 12%. Most mechanistic explanations for the tradeoff between egg production and survival have assumed that eggs compete for the allocation of nutrients that are necessary for survival. However, experiments typically alter only egg production or nutrition, and cannot distinguish between nutrient allocation and alternative mechanisms where some direct, permanent somatic insult results from reproduction. By manipulating both egg production and nutrient availability, we distinguish between these alternatives and unambiguously demonstrate that nutrient allocation can be a mechanism for mortality trade-offs.

AB Moisture seasonality may control forest floor decomposition rates in tropical forests. We used a mass balance model and 5 yr (December 1986 through December 1990) of weekly litterfall and monthly forest floor mass measurements from control and dry season irrigated plots to test this hypothesis on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Litterfall and forest floor mass were greater in the dry season than in the wet season. Irrigation affected neither the timing nor the quantity of litterfall. In contrast, dry season irrigation reduced forest floor mass throughout the year, not just during the dry season. Forest floor decomposition during the dry season was enhanced by irrigation. During the dry season, net decomposition (in grams per square metre per day) and exponential decay coefficients (per day) averaged 48 and 42% greater, respectively, in irrigated plots than in control plots. As a consequence, seasonal differences in decomposition rates were more pronounced in the control plots than in the irrigated plots. Net decomposition rates, for example, averaged 105 and 22% greater during the wet season than during the dry season on control and irrigated plots, respectively. Net decomposition was positively correlated with rainfall in the control plots: but not in the irrigated plots. These results support the hypothesis that moisture seasonality controls forest floor decomposition in tropical moist forests.

AB We studied the evolution of litter size in natural and experimentally manipulated populations of Columbian ground squirrels (Spermophilus columbianus) in eastern Washington state and southwest Alberta. Litter size at weaning in a large natural population (mean = 3.51 pups/litter, 248 litters) was significantly lower than the litter size (6 pups) that produced the most offspring surviving to yearling age class. This evidence contradicted Lack's ''optimal litter size'' hypothesis, which predicts that the most productive litter size should approximate the mean. Litter size had no significant effect on the subsequent survival or reproduction of mothers, contrary to the negative effects predicted by the ''cost of reproduction'' hypothesis. Litter success varied among years, and good and bad years for reproduction could be experimentally simulated with food supplementations. However, small samples of the largest litters rendered the ''bad-years'' hypothesis inappropriate for application to our data. Proportional survival of offspring was relatively constant among different litter sizes, contrary to the necessary condition of the ''cliff edge'' hypothesis of a dramatic decrease in survival of young from the largest litters. The data supported the ''individual optimization'' hypothesis most strongly. As predicted, the number of surviving offspring increased with litter size, although in one population the six largest litters (2.4% of 248 litters) suffered reduced success. In natural and food-supplemented populations, changes in maternal body mass were associated with changes in litter size (r = 0.205 to 0.926). Because survival of young remained relatively constant as litter size increased, these correlations resulted in greater offspring success for mothers in better body condition.

AB This paper investigates whether body size-related constraints on home-range resource harvesting could lead to coexistence between interspecific competitors of different body size under conditions of complete niche overlap. With this objective, I analyzed the influence of body size on induced and sustainable resource limitation and its implications on the interaction between an individual and a fixed biomass of larger competitors in a four-dimensional space, consisting of two spatial dimensions describing competitor home range, resource availability, and time. It was shown that body size-related spatiotemporal constraints on home-range resource harvesting, trophic optimization, and relativity of resource availability determine absolute and relative amounts of unused home-range resources, restricting the influence of resource limitation induced by an individual to a definite size distance around its size. It was therefore concluded that: (1) when competition occurs asymmetrically with a superiority of large animals, size differences alone could allow coexistence, independently of any kind of resource partitioning; and (2) superiority of large animals should result from the resource density control that a larger competitor imposes on the smaller one whenever size differences for stable coexistence occur. Existing evidence of an inefficiency in home-range resource exploitation seems large enough to suggest a view of guilds based on a hierarchy of inclusive home ranges.

AB Classical food-web theory arises from Lotka-Volterra models. As an alternative, we develop a model from the logistic concept of demand and supply. We first extend the logistic to an arbitrary species in a trophic chain or stack by developing a simple equation for any population X(i):
   [GRAPHICS]
   which includes the effects of intra-specific competition for fixed resources (the term b(i)X(i), intra-specific competition for renewable resources in the lower trophic level (the term X(i)/c(i)X(i-1)), and consumers in the upper trophic level (the term d(i)X(i+1)/X(i)). This equation emerges from the basic logistic concept of demand and supply, as captured by the consumer/resource ratios, and fulfills all the requirements for a plausible food-chain equation.
   We then generalize the equation to any population in a food web of arbitrary complexity
   [GRAPHICS]
   where F-j(r(i)) is the fraction of population X(j) that is a resource for i, and F-k(c(i)) is the fraction of population X(k) that consumes i. This equation meets all the requirements for a general food web model. Some properties of the model are discussed.

AB Non-genetic effects of maternal environment often have large influences on offspring phenotypes. Some maternal effects may be adaptive in heterogeneous environments, whereby mothers can program a developmental switch in their offspring in response to a predictive environmental cue. For herbivorous insects, maternal rearing host (i.e., maternal environment) may have large effects on offspring, including adaptive effects on patterns of host suitability, For example, if maternal rearing host is predictive of local host availability, then it is advantageous for mothers reared on one host to produce offspring that are physiologically ''acclimated'' to that host.
   Previous research has demonstrated that seed beetles, Stator limbatus, collected from Cercidium floridum survived better and developed faster on this host than beetles collected from Acacia greggii or C. microphyllum at either the same site or from a different locality. These results indicate either within- and among-population host-associated genetic differentiation or a non-genetic maternal host effect, in which offspring survive better and develop faster on the host their mother was reared on. We examine the influence of maternal and paternal rearing hosts on the survivorship, development time, and body size of offspring in S. limbatus. We find no evidence that beetles are acclimated to perform better on the host their mother was reared on via non-genetic maternal effects. However, maternal rearing host did affect offspring in other ways; mothers reared on C. floridum produced larger offspring that developed faster than offspring of mothers reared on A. greggii, due to a non-genetic maternal effect (paternal rearing host had no effect). In addition, both maternal and paternal host had a large effect on offspring survivorship; offspring of parents reared on C. floridum survived better than those of parents reared on A. greggii. The symmetry between the maternal and paternal host effects on survivorship suggests that they represent a response to intense selection during the experiment, and suggest the potential for rapid adaptation to this host. Alternatively, non-genetic effects of both maternal and paternal rearing host may simultaneously influence survivorship of S. limbatus offspring. Although paternal effects are generally disregarded as an important source of environmental variation, they are potentially important for S. limbatus; non-genetic paternal effects were detected in this experiment for development time of offspring: fathers reared on C, floridum produced offspring that developed slower on C. floridum, and offspring that developed faster on A. greggii, than fathers reared on A. greggii.

AB Insular systems tend to exhibit nonrandom patterns of species composition in which smaller species assemblages contain successive subsets of those found on richer ones. The fact that such ''nested'' patterns of species composition have usually been observed in systems where species number is correlated with island size has led to the hypothesis that differences among species in the effect of island size on the probability of extinction represent the main mechanism producing nested patterns of species composition. This study tested the hypothesis that differences among species in dispersal ability may interact with geographic isolation to produce nested subsets of species composition, This hypothesis was tested in a system of woody plants inhabiting artificial islands that were created by the filling of the Clarks Hill Reservoir, Georgia, USA. All of the studied islands had been logged prior to their separation from the mainland and their species number 34 yr later was found to be negatively correlated with distance to the closest mainland. The results of the present analysis indicated that (1) species occupancy of the whole island system was highly nested, (2) nestedness occurred with respect to geographic isolation but not with respect to island size, (3) only a small portion of the overall species included in the study contributed to the observed nestedness, and (4) the degree to which individual species contributed to the observed nestedness was correlated with their dispersal properties, with wind-dispersed species showing no evidence for nestedness and species lacking adaptations for long-range dispersal showing the strongest patterns of nestedness. These results indicate that isolation effects may interact with species-specific dispersal properties to produce nested subsets of species composition.

AB Most stands of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) in northern Yellowstone National Park appear to have become established between 1870 and 1890, with little regeneration since 1900. There has been controversy throughout this century regarding the relative roles of browsing by elk (Cervus elaphus) and fire suppression in preventing aspen regeneration. Fires in 1988 burned 22% of the northern ungulate winter range in the park, and created an unusual opportunity to investigate interactions between fire, ungulate browsing, and aspen regeneration. We tested two hypotheses. (1) The fires would stimulate such prolific sprouting of new aspen stems in burned stands that many stems would escape ungulate browsing and regenerate a canopy of large aspen stems. (2) Browsing pressure would be so intense that it would inhibit aspen canopy regeneration in the burned stands, despite prolific sprouting, but increased forage production in the burned areas would attract elk so that they would not seek out remote aspen stands, and hence, aspen regeneration would occur in unburned aspen stands remote from the burned areas.
   We sampled aspen sprout density, height, growth form, and browsing intensity in six burned aspen stands, six unburned stands close (< 1 km) to the burned area, and six unburned stands remote (>4 km) from the burned area. Density of sprouts was generally greater in the burned stands than in the unburned stands in spring 1990 (2 yr after the fires), but was approaching the density of unburned stands by fall 1991. There were no significant differences in browsing intensity (percent of aspen sprouts browsed by ungulates) in 1990 or 1991 among burned, unburned close, or unburned remote stands, nor were there differences in relation to growth form (juvenile vs. adult sprouts). Unbrowsed sprouts generally were lower than the depth of the snowpack, suggesting that elk browsed nearly all sprouts that were accessible.
   The age distribution of 15 aspen stands across the northern winter range indicated that p regeneration of large canopy stems had been episodic even prior to the establishment of the park in 1872. The period 1870-1890, when the present-day aspen stands were generated, was historically unique: numbers of elk and other browsers were low, climate was relatively wolf, Canis lupus) were present. This combination of events has not recurred since 1900. The recent paucity of aspen regeneration in northern Yellowstone National Park cannot be explained by any single factor (e.g., excessive elk numbers or fire suppression) but involves a complex interaction among factors.

AB We characterized the seasonal pattern of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of 49 grassland and shrubland sites corresponding to areas with low human impact. Each site was characterized as a vector of 21 elements, where each element corresponded to the average NDVI for one date. We used the integral of the NDVI as an estimate of the total production, and the difference between the maximum and minimum NDVI over the year as a measure of the seasonality.
   Based on a Principal Component Analysis, the integral of the NDVI accounted for 63% of the variability of the SITEXDATE matrix. The difference between the maximum and minimum NDVI throughout the year accounted for 19%. Mean annual precipitation explained 67% of the variability of the integral of the NDVI curves (P < 0.01). The slope of the relationship between precipitation and integrated NDVI was significantly steeper for grasslands than for shrublands. The difference between the extreme values of NDVI increased with mean annual precipitation and the thermal amplitude, and decreased with mean annual temperature (P < 0.01).

AB Benefits and costs are central to optimality theories of plant defense. Benefit is the gain in fitness to reducing herbivory and cost is the loss in fitness to committing resources to defense. We evaluate the benefits and costs of defense in a neotropical shrub, Psychotria horizontalis. Plants were either exposed to herbivores or protected within a cage of fine mesh in three gardens planted in large light gaps on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Two cuttings of each of 35 clones were paired based on initial masses and assigned randomly to a garden and to either the exposed or protected treatment. Annual rates of herbivory were 37% for exposed plants and 17% for protected plants. Among the exposed plants, high tannin concentration and tough leaves reduced herbivory. Twenty months after planting, the protected plants had a 10-fold higher growth rate, and 5.5 times more leaf area and dry mass than the protected plants. Twenty-two percent of the protected plants flowered, whereas no exposed plants flowered. Within the protected treatment, both total tannin concentration and leaf toughness varied among clones, which suggests that these traits are heritable. Total tannin concentration, but not toughness, was negatively correlated with growth for protected plants, which implies a cost to producing tannins. High tannin concentration and tough leaves reduced herbivory, however, these benefits of defense were balanced by the costs such that there were no significant differences in growth among exposed plants. These results are consistent with the hypotheses that there are benefits to being defended, that defense can be costly, and that herbivores act as selective agents in the evolution of plant defense.

AB Tristylous plant populations should exhibit equal frequencies of the three style morphs at equilibrium. In contrast, New England and central Ontario populations of Decodon verticillatus (Lythraceae) show a marked deficiency of the mid-styled (M) morph. This pattern was also evident in an independent sample of 30 populations from eastern Ontario; all nine cases of morph loss involved the M morph, and this morph also occurred at low frequencies, especially in large trimorphic populations. The hypothesis that a fitness disadvantage to the M morph accounts for its low frequency was not supported by data from a series of held and glasshouse experiments. Measures of reproductive success from two populations showed no disadvantage to the M morph, but revealed substantially higher seed set in the mid- (M) and short-styled (S) morphs than in the long-styled (L) morph. A pollen addition experiment showed that low seed set in the L morph can only partly be explained by reduced pollen receipt. Comparison of morph frequencies between adult plants and their open-pollinated progeny in three populations failed to reveal any morph-specific fitness differences. Analysis of growth and flowering of open-pollinated progeny from three populations in a 2-yr glasshouse experiment revealed differences among morphs for some parameters in some populations, but no consistent patterns were evident. The deficiency of the M morph may have resulted from an historical accident during post-glacial colonization of parts of the northern range. Computer calculations examining the return of morph frequencies to equilibrium after major perturbations indicated that populations of long-lived clonal species like D. verticillatus may preserve skewed morph ratios for > 10 000 yr. Moreover, the distribution of fossil seeds indicates that this species has occurred in its post-glacial range in southern Ontario for only approximate to 5000 yr. It is important to distinguish between ecological and evolutionary time scales when testing selective interpretations of microevolutionary patterns involving clonal taxa in glaciated regions.

AB Enemy-free space is a potentially important factor affecting host plant use by phytophagous insects. In particular, escape from parasitoids, predators and competitors could mediate a successful host shift by compensating for decreased feeding performance on a new plant. Here I investigate the effects that two braconid wasp parasitoids (Opius lectus and Biosteres melleus) have on sympatric host races of Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae) infesting apple (Malus pumila) and hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) at a field site near Grant, Michigan, USA.
   Levels of parasitoid attack were much lower for fly larvae infesting the derived host apple (13%) compared to the ancestral host hawthorn (46%). At least three factors contributed to apples being a relatively safe haven from parasitoids for maggots. First, apples were larger (mean fruit width = 5.2 cm) than hawthorns (mean width = 1.6 cm). Apples therefore provided greater physical protection for fly larvae than hawthorns because the ovipositors of female wasps were too short to reach a majority of maggots feeding within apples. Second, apples had an earlier fruiting phenology than hawthorns and the seasonal distribution of O. lectus parasitoids was asynchronous with the development of larvae in apples. Third, hawthorn fruits were infested by various species of caterpillars (tortricids and an agonoxenid) and a curculionid weevil to a much greater degree than apples (65% compared to 11%). These heterospecific insects forced fly larvae to feed near the surface of hawthorn fruits where they were more prone to detection and attack from braconids (73% of larvae feeding in hawthorns with heterospecific insects were parasitized compared to 34% of larvae infesting hawthorns without caterpillars and weevils). Data from other Rhagoletis and tephritid species suggest that escape from parasitoids may be a common theme in host range expansion and race formation for these flies.

AB Patterns of population dynamics are determined by the interaction between density-dependent and density-independent processes. To examine the responsiveness of various demographic and behavioral processes to population density, we maintained replicate meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) populations at low, medium, and high densities inside field enclosures in southeastern New York. Density was manipulated by re moving subadults during biweekly live-trapping sessions. Under higher density conditions voles exhibited: (1) a truncated breeding season; (2) reduction in growth rates of individuals; (3) increase in age (but not size) at sexual maturity; and (3) reduction in movement distances of individuals. Extremely large-bodied votes were most frequent in low-density enclosures and least common in high-density ones. Survival rates of adults were delayed density dependent. Reproductive rates during the middle of the breeding season and survival rates of juveniles and subadults were not affected by vole density. We conclude that vole populations are stabilized by density-dependent reductions in reproductive rate and recruitment, but destabilized by density-independent survival rates of young, and by density-dependent compression of individual movements, which accomodates population growth. The time delay in the effects of density on survival of adults may provide a mechanism for vole cycles in which lagged density-dependent mortality plays a central role.

AB Using a comparative approach, we tested the prediction that relative competitive performance of plant species is correlated with distribution along natural gradients of fertility and standing crop. The mean position of 40 species of herbaceous plants along standing crop, phosphorus, nitrate, magnesium, potassium, pH, and percent organic content gradients was calculated based on data from 217 quadrats from lake and river shorelines in Nova Scotia, Quebec, and Ontario. Competitive performance was measured in an outdoor experiment in which species were grown together with a common phytometer, Lythrum salicaria (n = 5 replicates per species). The relative ability of each species to suppress the growth of the phytometer was used as a measure of relative competitive performance. This measure of competitive performance was significantly correlated with the mean position of species on the standing crop (r = 0.081; P < 0.0001), percent organic content (r = 0.71; P < 0.0001); phosphorus (r = 0.70; P < 0.0001), nitrate (r = 0.67; P < 0.0001), magnesium (r = 0.66; P < 0.0001), and potassium gradients (r = 0.61; P < 0.0001). When monocotyledons and dicotyledons were considered separately, the relationship between distribution along the macronutrient gradients and competitive performance was much stronger for monocotyledons. It is suggested that this may reflect a differential influence of disturbance on distribution.

AB Diterpene alcohols produced by the brown seaweed Dictyota menstrualis deter feeding by numerous species of abundant herbivores. Here we show that these same compounds also may prevent fouling organisms from colonizing the surface of this alga. In the field, Dictyota menstrualis plants were less frequently and less heavily fouled than any of the other common seaweed species investigated. In laboratory assays, larvae of the common fouling bryozoan Bugula neritina failed to settle on Dictyota even though they contacted its surface as often as they contacted the surface of a preferred host alga. Rejection occurred only after direct contact with the alga's surface. Rejection of Dictyota was not mediated by water-borne chemical cues or by surface wettability (a physical property of the surface that can affect fouling). The lipid-soluble extract from surface rubbings of Dictyota inhibited larval settlement when placed on other surfaces and contained the diterpene alcohols pachydictyol A and dictyol E. Larvae exposed to these compounds experienced mortality, abnormal development, or reduced rates of development.
   Although the potential for chemically mediated coevolution between plants and herbivores has been the focus of scores of previous investigations, such coevolution will depend on selection altering the chemical defenses of the plant following the evolution of resistance by herbivores. Such a reciprocal response will be constrained if compounds play multiple roles that are ecologically important. Dictyota produces secondary metabolites that are broadly defensive against a wide variety of consumers and fouling organisms. Although certain consumers may evolve resistance to these metabolites, it is unclear that feeding by these consumers will result in reciprocal responses from the plant. We suggest that coevolved interactions may be uncommon, and that many interactions that appear to be coevolved may result from fortuitous and opportunistic preadaptations.

AB We studied the landscape-level spatial variation in distribution and abundance of seven species of canopy and subcanopy palms in a neotropical rain forest. Within 568 ha of nonswamp old-growth lowland forest at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, we sampled at 516 intersections of a reserve-wide grid to systematically assess the species' distributions across the major edaphic gradients. We found mosaics of community structure related to marked within-forest variability in both soil and topography. Total stem density of this guild varied with both edaphic factors. Steep sites had twice as many large palms (>10 m tall) per hectare than those on gentler topography or at lower slope positions. The combined density of subcanopy and canopy palms also varied significantly among soil types in the smallest size class (1-5 m tall), but not for larger individuals. Local (point) species richness of the subcanopy and canopy palms varied among soil types.
   Of the seven species, two (Astrocaryum alatum and A. confertum) were rare. All others showed significant edaphic variation in their distribution and/or estimated density. Two closely related species had strong and opposite edaphic associations. Euterpe macrospadix was biased toward steep topography and less fertile sites. Prestoea decurrens was nearly ommipresent on soil types with gentle topography while absent from half the points on soils with steep slopes. Two other closely related species, Iriartea deltoidea and Socratea exorrhiza, while virtually omnipresent across soil types and topographic positions, showed marked reciprocal variation in density between related soils. Iriartea's spatial distribution further indicates local removal of this species from one sector of the old growth by human harvesting (with subsequent apparent ''release'' of Socratea in this site). The most abundant species, Welfia georgii, while present at all sample points, showed significant among-soil variation in density.
   This substructuring of the arborescent palm guild results from the interplay of edaphic variation and past human activity. These findings and evidence from other sites suggest that marked spatial heterogeneity in community structure, at small to large scales (0.5-10(3) ha), may be general among tropical wet forests. Study of the spatial scales and causes of this variability will produce a more robust understanding of these complex ecosystems.

AB Frugivory in birds is associated with rapid gut passage whereas insectivory is associated with slower gut passage. This is interpreted by some avian ecologists to reflect an inherent digestive constraint on diet selection, but it could also result from dietary acclimation. We predicted that Yellow-rumped Warblers (Dendroica coronata) acclimated to fruit-, insect-, and seed-based diets would exhibit retention times that increase in that rank order, because this is the rank order of retention time across species that eat these types of food. We also predicted a trade-off between rate of processing (the inverse of retention time) and extraction efficiency. This is based on the assumption that digestive enzymes or absorptive capacity occur in the gastrointestinal tract at levels that are not in great excess, and so less contact time between enzymes and digesta reduces the extraction efficiency. To test these predictions, we measured retention time (using aqueous and lipid-phase inert markers) and extraction efficiency of glucose, sucrose, leucine, starch, and the lipid glycerol trioleate (using radio-labeled nutrients and inert markers). Our results were in accordance with predictions. Mouth-to-anus total mean retention time (TMRT) of Yellow-rumped Warblers acclimated to fruit-, insect-, and seed-based diets were, respectively, 46 +/- 9, 62 +/- 6, and 114 +/- 9 min for polyethylene glycol (PEG, an aqueous marker): results were similar for the lipid phase marker in most cases. But Yellow-rumped Warblers that were switched suddenly to an alternate diet did not readjust TMRT when tested 2 h later or did so incompletely. We found no diet-related morphological changes in the digestive tract, and thus attribute these results to changes in gut motility. Extraction efficiency was uniformly high across all diets for glucose (88 +/- 1%), but varied among diet groups according to our prediction for leucine (range 82 - 94%), sucrose (58 - 85%), starch (9 - 48%), and lipid (18 - 82%). We review how features of the Yellow-rumped Warbler's digestive system permit relatively high energy uptake across a wide variety of food types. The most notable constraining feature was a low starch hydrolysis rate, probably restricting them from relying on starchy foods. Thus, digestive strategy (i.e., a combination of retention time of food in the gut and digestive efficiency) somewhat determines diet, but in more respects diet determines strategy.

AB To quantify the magnitude and pattern of spatial variation in local population density within a single species, we analyzed large numbers of samples, representing a large geographic area or a wide range of ecological conditions. Our analyses focused on, but were not limited to, censuses of birds recorded in the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Birds and other organisms exhibited a common pattern: each species was represented by only a few individuals in most of the sample sites where it occurred, but was orders of magnitude more abundant in a few ''hot spots.'' The highly clumped frequency distributions of intraspecific abundance among sample sites resemble distributions, such as the negative binomial, canonical lognormal, and broken stick, that have been used to characterize the distribution of abundances among species within local ecological communities.
   We hypothesize that the spatial variation in abundance largely reflects the extent to which local sites satisfy the niche requirements of a species. Several results are consistent with this hypothesis. First, a computer simulation model in which abundance is determined by the multiplicative combination of several independent environmental variables produces ranked distributions of abundances similar to those observed empirically. Second, geographic patterns of abundance of bird species have been relatively stable over several decades, indicating that different abundances are associated with particular places on the landscape. Third, the abundance of bird species varies in a systematic way over the geographic range, exhibiting positive spatial autocorrelation at small distances and a tendency to increase from the edges toward the center of the range.
   The magnitude and pattern of spatial variation in local population density has important implications for basic ecology and biogeography, especially for the dynamics and regulation of abundance in both space and time, the limits and internal structure of the geographic range, and the interspecific variation in abundance observed within local communities. Patterns of spatial and temporal variation in abundance should be considered in the design of nature reserves and the conservation of biological diversity.

AB Species of the genus Daphnia are generalized filter-feeders and potentially strong competitors, yet several species often coexist in the open waters of lakes. We investigated the population dynamics and competitive interactions of two Daphnia species in Gull Lake, Michigan. In each of 3 yr D. pulicaria was always common, while D. galeata mendotae became abundant only in late summer. The summer invasion of D. galeata mendotae was associated with a decline in abundance of D. pulicaria in some, but not all years. Decline of D. pulicaria was strongly predicted by the loss of oxygen from deep water during summer, which resulted in greater spatial overlap between the species, and by changes in the quality of the phytoplankton resources.
   We employed in situ enclosures to manipulate the density of each species and quantify the intensity of intra- and interspecific competition. Repeated competition experiments demonstrated that the relative exploitative ability of the species reversed from early to late summer. Strong interspecific competition was often observed, but its strength varied with juvenile or adult stage, and with season. Daphnia pulicaria juveniles were always affected strongly by interspecific effects: while D. galeata mendotae juveniles were impacted largely by intraspecific effects. The relative strength of intra- and interspecific competition on adults reversed from early to late summer for each species. The magnitude of intra- and interspecific effects on D. pulicaria adults was similar during early summer, but by late summer interspecific effects were much stronger than intraspecific effects. The reverse was true for D. galeata mendotae adults; interspecific effects greatly decreased in late summer. This seasonal shift in the nature of competitive interactions provides an explanation for seasonal succession in this Daphnia assemblage.

AB We quantitatively assessed rodent dispersal of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in a lowland tropical rain forest. We examined fecal pellets from seven rodent species of the genera Proechimys, Oryzomys, and Mesomys trapped each month from August 1983 through July 1984 at the Cocha Cashu field station in Manu National Park, Peru.
   We found sporocarps of Sclerocystis coremioides and spores of four Glomus species in 69.3% of fecal samples, with 37.5% of samples containing 2-4 fungus species. There were median numbers of 8.6 S. coremioides sporocarps and 712 Glomus spores/0.1 g feces. S. coremioides and all Glomus species comprised up to 4.1 and 5.4% of fecal mass, respectively. We did not detect differences in fungus consumption by rodent species or sex, but did find significant differences between rodent genera. More than 60% of Proechimys samples contained glomalean fungi in contrast to approximate to 37% of Oryzomys samples. Occurrence of the two fungus genera in feces differed seasonally but was generally congruent between Proechimys and Oryzomys. Glomus presence in feces is significantly positively associated with the dry season. Both rodent genera together annually pass 2.96 x 10(5) S. coremioides sporocarps and 7.30 x 10(7) Glomus spores/ha at Cocha Cashu. We concluded that Proechimys and Oryzomys are likely to be important agents of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus spore dispersal.

AB We performed supplemental feeding experiments during three breeding seasons of the Blue Tit (Parus caeruleus L.) in order to establish the importance of food in reproductive timing. In particular, we addressed the question of why the response to supplemental food is restricted to 3-6 d in many bird species. Supplemental food advanced the start of egg-laying in all three breeding seasons. The mean difference between fed and control pairs was 4 d in two years and 6 d in another. The amount and quality of the supplemental food used in the experiment were not limiting, since pairs receiving a further increase in amount and quality of food did not start laying earlier than pairs with a standard feeding regime. The amount of food that was consumed increased during the period from 15 d before egg formation until the beginning of egg formation and then remained at a high utilization rate until clutch completion. Although fed pairs, on average, started egg-laying earlier than control pairs, the earliest control females started to lay eggs as early as the first fed females. Fed pairs were also relatively late in a year when control pairs were late. In 1992, fed pairs did not produce larger clutches or more fledglings, but had nestlings with lower mass at 13 d post-hatching than those of control pairs. Analysis at the territory level revealed that supplemental food affected laying date to a greater extent in low-quality territories, in which laying could be advanced by up to 9-10 d, compared to high-quality territories in which laying was not advanced at all. We conclude that Laying date in most Blue Tit females is limited by low food supply early in spring, but some females, occupying high-quality territories, will not advance laying in response to food. Thus, above a certain critical limit, laying date is unrelated to food supply, and birds use other cues in their decision to commence breeding. Such cues are probably also responsible for the between-year variation in laying dates of food-supplemented pairs, since these were provided with the same amount of food during the different years.

AB This study was designed to measure and separate the physiological costs of inducible defenses from life history trade-offs and maternal effects in the waterflea Daphnia pulex. Juveniles of D. pulex produce morphological changes (''neckteeth'') and undergo life history shifts as defenses against predatory Chaoborus (phantom midge) larvae. These traits are induced by a chemical cue (kairomone) released by the predator. I performed life history experiments with and without Chaoborus kairomones at different food levels to quantify the induced changes and their potential physiological costs. The Daphnia clone used in this study also increased its body depth in response to the predator substance. Life history shifted toward a larger body size (both length and depth) and higher fecundity, which was balanced by an increased time to reach maturity and by increased adult instar durations, Reproductive effort was higher in the typical morph in the first adult instar, indicating resource allocation shifts towards growth in the protected morph. However, even in the absence of predation the chemically induced protected morph tended to show an increased intrinsic rate of population growth (r).
   The longer time to reach maturity was not a direct physiological cost of neckteeth production, but a trade-off for larger body size. The life history shifts are independent of neckteeth formation. Developmental mechanisms leading to life history changes occurred after neckteeth were induced and could thus be uncoupled from neckteeth formation and its direct costs. In this study no direct costs were found. Carbon incorporation rates for the two morphs, at high and low food, were not different.
   As a maternal effect, the larger females of the induced morph produced larger neonates which, in turn, matured at a larger size. Morphological changes, life history shifts, and maternal effects acted in concert to form defenses against Chaoborus.
   This study shows that the often assumed high physiological costs resulting from the formation or maintenance of the defenses are not necessary to explain the evolution of inducible defenses. As morphological changes increase the visibility of Daphnia pulex, a fitness disadvantage can be caused by a changing predator regime (e.g., fish). The results of this study suggest that environments with changing predator selectivities favor the evolution of inducible defenses.

AB To examine the effectiveness of larval antipredator mechanisms and to test the assumption that diet breadth and chemistry are important predictors of predation responses, I offered 70 species of lepidopteran larvae to the predatory ant Paraponera clavata (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Prey chemistry and diet breadth were significant predictors of rejection, as was plant chemistry but to a lesser degree. Specialist caterpillars were better protected than generalists, and prey with unpalatable extracts were frequently rejected by P. clavata, while prey with palatable extracts were rarely rejected. Specialists with unpalatable host plant extracts were more likely to be rejected than specialists that had host plants with more palatable extracts. Other significant predictors included morphology, behavior, and interactions between developmental stage and prey chemistry and between developmental stage and diet breadth. I concluded that predation could be a substantial selective force in the evolution of narrow diet breadth and that plant chemistry could be the mechanism whereby specialists are better defended.

AB The analysis of records of species occurrences on islands in an attempt to detect interactions between species has been an area of controversy in recent years in terms of the validity of some of the statistical methods used. In this note I make two contributions to the continuing debate. First, I advocate a generalized Monte Carlo testing procedure because this is easy to implement, is computationally efficient, and has guaranteed properties when the null hypothesis of no species interactions is correct. Second, I propose a test statistic that can be decomposed into a component for each individual species, and I demonstrate how this makes it possible to isolate species with unusual patterns of co-occurrence with other species, even after an allowance for multiple testing is made.

AB We determined the consequences of systematic changes in nutrient availability during long-term soil development by measuring foliar nutrient concentrations. Sun leaves of the dominant tree Metrosideros polymorpha and of eight other species were sampled in Hawaiian rain forests developed on substrates that were 0.3 x 10(3), 2.1 x 10(3), 5 X 10(3), 20 x 10(3), 150 X 10(3), 1400 X 10(3), and 4100 x 10(3) yr old. Elevation, annual precipitation, parent material, and dominant species were nearly constant along this gradient. Foliar N and P concentrations in Metrosideros were lowest in the youngest site (0.72% and 0.052% for N and P, respectively), increased to a maximum on 20 X 10(3) and 150 X 10(3)-yr-old substrates (1.45% and 0.108%), and then declined close to the initial concentrations in the oldest site (0.86% and 0.061%); N:P ratios in foliage varied relatively little across the sites. Most other species followed a similar pattern of variation. On a per unit leaf area basis, foliar N and P contents in Metrosideros also peaked on intermediate-aged substrate. Foliar nutrient concentrations in Metrosideros sun leaves were determined across a parallel but wetter substrate age gradient. The pattern of variation was similar on both gradients, but the magnitude of variation was smaller on the wetter sequence of sites. Overall, the pattern of variation in foliar nutrients with substrate age is consistent with conceptual models for the dynamics of soil nutrient availability during long-term soil development, and with measurements of soil properties along this sequence.

AB How a predator responds to fluctuating prey abundances determines its capacity to regulate the prey's population levels. Unlike many terrestrial and a few marine arthropods, key intertidal invertebrate predators, e.g., sea stars and whelks, have been portrayed as lacking rapid behavioral responses that would permit them to control episodes of massive prey recruitment. Our field experiments demonstrated that intertidal sea stars, Pisaster ochraceus, rapidly change densities and alter diet in response to varying recruitment of their prey, the mussels Mytilus spp. Densities of Pisaster foraging at high tide were positively correlated with an index of recruitment of Mytilus californianus. The sea stars aggregated in episodes of massive mussel recruitment and dispersed as local abundances of juvenile mussels declined. Aggregation and dispersal were reproduced in field experiments by adding or removing masses of 1st-yr Mytilus spp. to naturally occurring mussel beds.
   Over the 7 yr of the study, the lower margins of the mussel beds, a distributional limit set at least in some circumstances by the sea stars, remained relatively constant, despite significant year-to-year variation in mussel recruitment rates. We speculate that aggregation acts in concert with previously hypothesized long-term responses to stabilize thp lower distributional limits of the mussels.

AB California red scale is suppressed to very low densities by the parasitoid Aphytis melinus. The system also appears stable. We report on an experimental test of the hypothesis that stability is caused by a refuge for scale. In a grapefruit grove in southern California in 1984-1985, the bark in the interior part of the tree provided a partial refuge from parasitism. Scale were approximate to 100 times denser there than in the exterior of trees. In a field experiment, we removed Argentine ants from some blocks of trees to test whether (1) ants caused the refuge by interfering with Aphytis and (2) the expected reduction in scale density in the refuge would lead to an unstable interaction in the exterior. We also tested for density-dependent parasitism, host mutilation, and predation by analyzing data from samples and from scale placed in the field.
   The temporal variability of the scale was at the low end of the range recorded in field populations. The experiment provided some evidence in support of the refuge hypothesis. The population in the refuge fluctuated much less than that in the exterior. Ant exclusion led to increased parasitism and lower scale density in the interior, and to increased fluctuations in abundance in the refuge and exterior. However, these changes were relatively small and perhaps temporary, suggesting that (1) ants are not the main cause of the refuge and that (2) we did not reduce the refuge density enough to determine whether the system would go unstable in the absence of the refuge population.
   Parasitism, host mutilation, and predation rates on scale showed no temporal density dependence, either direct or delayed, though detection of such patterns is difficult. Possible alternative stabilizing mechanisms include size-dependent interactions between red scale and Aphytis.

AB The development and distribution of Northern mires, including minerotrophic fens and ombrotrophic raised bogs, frequently are presumed to be strongly controlled by the interplay of regional climate and site geomorphology and history. Investigations of these relationships provide insights into long-term trends in ecosystem development by linking geological and landscape-scale processes. In this study, a theoretical model for raised-bog development integrates internal bog hydrodynamics with external factors, including local substrate characteristics, and regional temperature and moisture conditions. The model is used to interpret the development of raised bogs in the Bergslagen region, which coincides with the modern northern distributional limit of those mires in central Sweden. The development of minerotrophic fens that precede bog formation is also considered. Basal radiocarbon dates along surveyed transects are used to assess the pattern and timing of peatland formation and rates of lateral expansion. Previous palynological and lake-level studies from the same region provide independent evidence for changes in Holocene climate.
   Fen initiation in the region occurred throughout the Holocene under a broad range of environmental conditions. Once established, fens appear to expand faster during moister periods. Locally, substrate slope is an important mediator of fen development, with slopes >0.5% inhibiting lateral expansion. Accumulation of Sphagnum peat, an indicator of raised-bog initiation, occurred from approximate to 4000 to 5000 yr BP during relatively dry phases. Rates of lateral expansion were not significantly affected by increasing moisture or by decreasing temperatures until at least 2000 yr BP. However, modern geographic trends in cross-sectional shape of mires suggest that, at the northern limit of their range today, raised bogs are limited by low temperatures.

AB We analyzed changes in the stable C isotope composition (delta(13)C) of bulk tissues and lignin fractions during a 2-yr decomposition study in east-central Minnesota (USA) of aboveground and belowground litter from four perennial grass species: Schizachyrium scoparium (C-4), Agropyron repens (C-3), Poa pratensis (C-3), and Agrostis scabra (C-3). Although lignin concentrations increased for all litter types during decomposition and lignin fractions were consistently depleted in C-13 compared to bulk tissues (3.6 parts per thousand more negative on average), we found neither convergence of bulk tissue delta(13)C values towards lignin delta(13)C values, nor greater stability of delta(13)C values for lignin fractions. Furthermore, delta(13)C values of C-3 and C-4 species shifted in opposite directions during decomposition. Thus, our data do not support the hypothesis that delta(13)C values decrease during decomposition because of the selective preservation of lignin and we instead suggest that isotopic shifts are caused by the incorporation of new C from soil organic matter into litter by microbial decomposers. We estimate that this new C comprised 12-19% of the total litter C, depending on species, at the point of 70% mass loss.
   In monocultures of these four species plus another C-4 grass (Andropogon gerardi) growing on initially homogeneous soils with a predominantly C-3 isotopic signature, soil delta(13)C values increased 1.6-2.2 parts per thousand for the C-4 species and remained relatively unchanged for the C-3 species after 4 yr. Averaging across the C-4 species and the experimental soil organic matter gradient, 14% of the total soil C in these plots must be new C-4 C to account for this isotopic shift. We estimate that this amount of new soil C equals 30% of NPP summed over 4 yr in these plots.

AB Extended leaf longevity has been explained both as an adaptation to conserve nutrients and to increase seasonal or life-time carbon gain. The relative importance of these possible adaptations was investigated in the wintergreen dwarf shrub Rhododendron lapponicum by analyses of responses of growth and nutrient allocation to early and late spring defoliation and to natural reduction of leaf biomass following flowering.
   Removal of old leaves at the time of budbreak had no effect on biomass accumulation and nutrient pools of the new shoots 1 mo later, although the defoliation prevented the transport of resorbed nutrients from old leaves to the new shoots. This transport accounted for by far the largest part of the increase in shoot N and P in undefoliated controls. Extra nutrients were not transported from stems and roots to compensate for the lost import from old leaves. Hence, defoliated plants compensated for the losses solely by increasing nutrient uptake.
   In contrast, defoliation 3 wk earlier caused a 29% reduction of annual shoot growth and a proportional decline of nutrient pools in the shoots, while the nutrient concentrations, reflecting the shoot nutrient status, did not decline. Almost identical responses were observed in unmanipulated plants the year after heavy flowering. Reproductive branches do not form leaves, resulting in a decreasing photosynthetic capacity and a reduction of resource storage and allocation to next year's leaf cohort.
   Although early and late spring defoliation caused equal losses of mobile nutrients, only the early defoliation decreased growth, suggesting that it was the loss of carbon rather than nutrients that affected growth. This supports earlier observations that the extended retention time of leaves in wintergreen and evergreen species plays a greater role in improving the carbon balance than in supplying the new leaves with nutrients.

AB In size-structured populations, interactions are strongly dependent on size-specific foraging and anti-predator capacities of the organism. Conflicting size-specific selection pressures over the ontogeny often have different effects on different species leading to asymmetries in competitive and predator-prey interactions. Habitat complexity is likely to affect such asymmetric interactions due to species/size-specific competitive abilities in different habitats and due to the fact that habitat structural complexity may act differently as a prey refuge for different species. We experimentally analyzed the impact of a piscivorous predator (adult perch, Perca fluviatilis) on performance of juvenile perch and roach (rutilus rutilus) at different levels of structural complexity (no structure, structure forming a partial refuge, and structure forming a complete refuge) in enclosures in an experimental pond. We measured predator diet and growth, prey fish habitat use, survival, diet and growth, and prey resource levels in different habitats.
   Prey fish (perch and roach) were found in the diet of piscivorous perch in no refuge and partial refuge treatments. Growth rate of the piscivorous perch decreased with increased refuge efficiency. Juvenile perch increased their proportional use of the structurally complex refuges in the presence of piscivorous perch and the survival increased with increased refuge efficiency (from partial to complete refuge). The diet of juvenile perch changed from predominantly cyclopoid copepods in the absence of predators to predominantly macroinvertebrates in the presence of predators. There was no effect of predator-induced habitat restriction on growth of juvenile perch. Roach survival also increased with increased refuge efficiency in the presence of predators, and roach survival in the refuge treatments did not differ from each other or from the treatments with predators absent. Predator-induced habitat restriction in roach was associated with a decreased growth of roach.
   Our results suggest that, compared to juvenile roach, juvenile perch may compensate more for lost foraging opportunity in the open water via increased exploitation of structure-associated prey in refuges. As a result, predator-induced habitat shifts by juvenile perch and roach may alter competitive interactions between the species. On the other hand, structural complexity may form an almost complete refuge for juvenile roach from predators and thereby affect the predator-prey relationships between piscivorous perch and juvenile perch and roach to the advantage of juvenile roach. The demonstrated effects of structural complexity on competitive and predator-prey interactions between perch and roach can be related to the two species' distributions in lakes with different degrees of structural complexity.

AB The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is a continental archipelagic system of 5000 reefs and shoals stretching >2000 km along the east Australia coast. The interconnectivity of these reefs should determine the choice of biological management units, which for most biota will reflect the dispersal of their eggs and/or larvae. A comparative approach using population genetics was used to ask whether the along-shore dispersal of coral reef fishes is influenced by the duration of this mobile phase.
   Seven species of coral reef fish, selected from three families to provide a range of taxonomic diversity and pelagic larval durations, were tested for genetic homogeneity between two regions of the GBR separated by 1000 km. A spectrum of potential dispersal capabilities was analyzed from that of Acanthochromis polyacanthus, a damselfish with brood care that uniquely lacks pelagic larvae, to that of Ctenochaetus striatus, a surgeonfish with large, specialized larvae that spend several months in the plankton. A total of 19 enzyme systems and general proteins were examined from multiple populations in each region to provide a base of 32 loci for these comparisons.
   With one exception, species sampled from different coral reefs within regions showed statistically significant heterogeneities across multiple loci, indicative of chaotic genetic patchiness among the samples. The exception was an anemonefish, Amphiprion melanopus, that had to be collected from large areas on each reef because of its law densities. The homogeneity of allele frequencies at local scales for this species suggests that the genetic patchiness observed in others may be a within-reef phenomenon that was manifested at the reef scale by our pseudoreplicated sampling strategy.
   After pooling local variability, all but two species showed significant regional differences. The exceptions were the pair (Ctenochaetus striatus, Pterocaesio chrysozona) with the longest larval durations. Acanthochromis polyacanthus showed increased variation at this larger scale, consistent with a major stock division between the two regions. The logarithm of genetic Variation between northern and southern populations (measured by Weir and Cockerham's F-st) was correlated with mean larval duration by an inverse linear relationship that explained 85% of the variance in the global data set. Comparison with an outgroup (Amphiprion melanopus from the Chesterfield Reefs, 1000 km east in the Coral Sea) confirmed the genetic cohesion of mainland populations for the species with shortest larval duration and shows that our empirical relationship applies only within the context of the highly connected GBR.
   On this basis, calculations of gene flow (N(e)m, the number of effective migrants per generation) between geographic regions predict panmixis for species with larval durations exceeding I mo. Many common species have shorter dispersal times, from which classical ''isolation-by-distance'' models predict differentiation between northern and southern populations at genetic equilibrium. Given that modern populations on the GBR are <10 000 yr old, however, there has not been sufficient time for such differences to evolve in situ and we consider alternative scenarios for the observed heterogeneities. Comparisons with invertebrate taxa sampled over the same spatial scales imply lower gene flows in fish despite longer pelagic durations. This suggests that fish larvae may use their greater mobility to retard, rather than enhance, dispersal due to hydrodynamic advection.

AB Polar deserts of the High Arctic contain vast areas of minimal plant cover and low primary productivity. Significant development of polar desert plant communities is largely restricted to areas with considerable cover of a cryptogamic soil crust, which develops in sites exposed to continued surface runoff from melting snow for some of the short growing season. Thus, soil drought and plant water stress have often been assumed to be major constraints to plant community development in polar deserts. To examine this issue, water availability and plant water relations of common herbaceous perennial plants were studied over three growing seasons in a typically barren (''noncrusted'') site and a site with a well-developed cryptogamic crust and vascular plant community (''crusted''). Soil water content was consistently higher in the crusted site than the noncrusted site through all growing seasons. These differences had limited biological relevance because subsurface soils at both sites remained effectively saturated (soil water potential > -0.1 MPa) through each growing season, despite low amounts of precipitation that varied nearly twofold from year to year. However, the surface soils (0.5-2.0 cm in depth), especially in noncrusted sites, dry considerably in some years. There were no significant differences in plant water potential and midday values of whole-plant transpiration and water vapor conductance for adult plants growing in crusted vs. noncrusted sites. Water stress for established plants was minor in both sites. Greater plant community development in crusted areas of this polar desert does not result from a reduction in plant water stress by a greater supply of meltwater through the growing season. instead, surface meltwaters probably benefit vascular plants indirectly by facilitating the growth, development, and nitrogen fixation activities of cryptogamic organisms in the soil crust. The presence and activity of these cryptogams favor vascular plant success through increased nutrient availability, soil organic matter, surface temperatures, reduced soil cryoturbation, and more favorable sites for germination and seedling establishment.

AB In spatially heterogeneous habitats, plant community change may reflect spatially localized population-level processes that are sensitive to the size of an average habitat patch. However, local species turnover can also be determined by initial conditions and large-scale processes, in which case patch size effects may be overridden. To examine the role of patch size in directing secondary succession, we subdivided a newly abandoned agricultural field into an array of experimental patches (32, 288, and 5000 m(2), grouped to sample equivalent portions of the field), and have thereafter censused the resident plant and animal communities at regular intervals. Here we report results from the first 6 yr of studies on the changing vascular plant community in an experimentally fragmented landscape. The general course of change in all patches followed a trajectory typical of old-field succession, toward increasing dominance by longer lived and larger plant species. The same group of species that dominated at the start of the study continued to dominate after 6 yr, although in very different proportional abundances. Larger patches were more species rich than their smaller counterparts, and had a higher proportion of nonshared species, but the additional species were transient and low in abundance. Spatial heterogeneity in vegetation, measured as local community dissimilarity, increased in all patches but to a lesser extent in the largest patches, where censuses of nearby permanent quadrats indicated less divergence over time. At a population level, the strongest effect of patch size was that local populations of clonal species were more prone to disappear from the smallest patches. Nevertheless, summary measures of temporal community change did not reflect significant differences in localized species turnover. We conclude that patch size does not markedly affect the rate or pattern of early secondary succession, at the scales imposed in our experiment.

AB Litter bags with natural mixed litter were incubated until approximate to 60-70% mass loss in two oak-hornbeam and two pine-beech forest stands in southern Poland. At the same stands the input of chemical elements with throughfall was followed. Decomposition constants k for the oak-hornbeam litters were -0.57 and -0.55, and for the pine-beech litters -0.30 and -0.27. Chemical elements (except for Cu and Mn) revealed similar relative mobility in the four litters. On average the elements could be ordered by decreasing mobility as follows: K > Mg > Ca > S > Cu > Na > Mn = N > Cd > Pb = Zn > Fe. Instead of the two presupposed factors controlling litter decomposition, biological and chemical, three factors were specified: (1) biological, dominating the decay of organic matter and the dynamics of N, Ca, Mg, Mn, and S; (2) physical, dominated by leaching and atmospheric deposition, and controlling the dynamics of organic matter, K, Na, Pb, Cd, and Zn; and (3) chemical, determining the dynamics of Fe, Zn, Pb, and Cd through the fixation of metal ions to humic substances. Potassium was the only element that decreased in concentration in all litters, while the concentrations of N, Na, Fe, Zn, Pb, and Cd increased in all litters. S, Ca, Mg, and Mn concentrations revealed different patterns in different litters, presumably due to the differences in initial concentrations and soil acidity. No clear trend was found for Cu. In all litter types, Fe, Zn, Pb, and Cd significantly increased in absolute amounts at the end of litter-bag incubation. In all four stands the input with throughfall was high enough to explain the increases in amount of elements, with the exception of Fe in the oak-hornbeam litters.

AB In order to better understand the spatial distributions of soil trophic groups and the potential significance of these distributions to ecosystem functioning we initiated a study to-describe the within-site variability of nematode feeding groups in a row-crop ecosystem. Soil cores were removed from a 48-ha corn (Zea mays) held in the U.S. Midwest prior to spring planting, and nematodes were identified by phenotypic criteria to four groups: bacterivores, fungivores, omnivores/predators, and plant parasites. Within-site variability was high for all groups; population counts spanned two orders of magnitude, with coefficients of variation ranging from 40-130% (n = 115-138 soil samples). Probability distributions were strongly lognormal. Geostatistical analysis showed that a major part of this variability was spatially dependent; variograms suggest that 70-99% of sample population variance was related to spatial autocorrelation over our geographic range of 6-80 m, except for the parasitic group, for which we detected no autocorrelation to 1200 m. Maps of nonparasitic feeding groups across the field showed large multi-hectare areas of low to moderate population densities, with sub-hectare clusters of high-density populations towards one end of the site. Individual feeding groups were only weakly correlated with one another across the held (Kendall's tau less than or equal to 0.363, P < 0.001). Edaphic factors (bulk density, texture, pH, C availability, N availability) could collectively explain <30% of the variability in the nonparasitic groups across the area sampled.
   Results suggest that important soil food web components are strongly patterned at subhectare scales in this site. That this patterning is maintained in an ecosystem subjected to the homogenizing influences of annual soil tillage and a monoculture plant population is remarkable, and suggests that such patterning may be even more common in less-disturbed sites. Inclusion of these patterns in studies of ecosystem processes and soil community dynamics may significantly improve soil trophic models and our understanding of the relationship between soil populations and ecosystem function.

AB Several recent papers raise the question of how frequently senescence is detectable in survival estimates from natural populations of mammals. If animals do not age, the probability of disappearance is constant through time. This null hypothesis leads to the prediction that lengths of residence on a trapping grid, censused monthly, will follow a geometric distribution. After testing for survival differences between sexes and among seasons, I compared lengths of residence (persistence) from capture-recapture data for five species of small rodents in an old-field habitat near Lawrence, Kansas, USA to geometric distributions. Gender did not influence persistence on the grid for any species, but persistence of Microtus ochrogaster and Reithrodontomys megalotis varied significantly with season. All species showed a tendency for high rates of disappearance in the Ist mo after individuals were marked. When the analysis was limited to individuals residing on the area for at least 1 mo, neither Peromyscus maniculatus, P. leucopus, nor Sigmodon hispidus departed significantly from the geometric model. Seasonal analysis of Reithrodontomys megalotis was precluded by small samples, but data for all seasons combined seemed to indicate age- (or persistence-) specific rates of disappearance, as did M. ochrogaster, except those first captured in spring. To identify which patterns were consistent with senescence, I regressed rates of disappearance against persistence, testing for positive slopes. Only those M. ochrogaster first captured in winter and autumn exhibited senescence by these criteria, despite disappearance rates of R. megalotis that increased sharply beyond persistence of 5 mo. The regression test for P. maniculatus indicated senescence even though the geometric test failed to indicate persistence specificity. The regression method alone is not a reliable test of senescence, because it does not incorporate variances of estimated probabilities of survival. Any approach derived from horizontal life tables potentially confounds seasonality with aging, making determination of senescence equivocal. In my data there is little convincing evidence that survival in the wild decreases with age in these rodents.

AB This paper demonstrates a new analysis of photon flux partitioning among species and an evaluation of the efficiency of photon flux capturing in terms of biomass investment. For that purpose, distributions of aboveground biomass, leaf area, and photon flux density (PPFD) were determined with the stratified harvest method in a stand of a tall herbaceous community on a floating fen at the time of peak standing crop. The stand contained 11 species and the photon flux absorbed by each species in the stand was estimated. Three tall dominant species absorbed 75% of the incident PPFD, while eight short subordinate species absorbed 2.5%. Tall species in the canopy received higher PPFD averaged over leaf area (Phi(area)). However, the PPFD absorbed per unit aboveground biomass (Phi(mass)) of the tall species was not higher than that of the subordinate species. Phi(mass) is a product of the leaf area ratio (LAR, the ratio of leaf area to aboveground biomass) and Phi(area). There was a trade-off relationship between LAR and Phi(area). To have a high Phi(area), plants place their leaves at higher positions in the canopy, which necessarily decreases LAR. Aboveground biomass was regarded as an investment (cost) to capture PPFD (benefit). Phi(mass), as a ratio of benefit to cost, indicates an efficiency of biomass investment to capture photon flux. Tall species appeared to have an advantage over subordinate species in receiving a large fraction of incident PPFD, while subordinate species have an advantage in efficiently using their biomass to capture PPFD.

AB Several models for the economics of sociality demonstrate that the probability distribution of an individual's resource consumption could depend on the size of its social group. When groups share food clumps discovered by any member, expected resource consumption may increase or decline with group size, but the individual's resource consumption variance will ordinarily decline as group size increases. Hence, the formation and dissolution of social groups may represent risk-sensitive responses to foraging success. A series of field studies report greater mean prey consumption and decreased prey consumption variance as group size in colonial spiders increases. Several hypotheses attempt to explain this effect. Coloniality may promote acquisition of information concerning temporal variation in prey availability. Colony membership may permit individuals to steal food when the number of captured prey varies spatially. Finally, coloniality can enhance food acquisition because prey (that might otherwise escape) ricochet from one spider's web to another group member's web. Our purpose was to quantify each hypothesis and ask if the resulting models predict reduced resource consumption variance as group size increases. We model each mechanism and conclude that stealing prey is the simplest explanation for variance reduction in spider colonies. We emphasize that variance among individuals need not provide a good estimate of the within-individual resource consumption variance, and it is the latter variance to which risk sensitivity responds.

AB Abiotic factors may constrain the functioning of species interactions such as plant-pollinator mutualisms. I investigated how thermal environment affects the interaction between the early-blooming daffodil, Narcissus longispathus (Amaryllidaceae) and its major bee pollinator (Andrena bicolor; Andrenidae), focusing simultaneously on plant and pollinator sides of the interaction. I studied fruit and seed set, flower duration, and the intrafloral thermal environment of N. longispathus, and the thermal biology, foraging behavior, and thermoregulatory ability of A. bicolor over a 6-yr period in southeastern Spain.
   N. longispathus flowers from February to April, when unsuitable weather often limits pollinator activity, yet most flowers are successfully pollinated in all years and sites. Fruit set was weakly pollen limited, but among flowers setting fruit the proportion of ovules developing into seeds was not. Individual flowers lasted for 17 d on average, remaining functional during this period. On sunny days, the air inside N. longispathus flowers was significantly warmer than outside. Mean temperature excess inside flowers was as high as 8 degrees C, and was positively related to solar irradiance. Within flowers, air temperature was highest around the anthers; this intrafloral gradient was consistent with variation among perianth parts in radiation transmittance.
   Andrena bicolor foraged in N. longispathus flowering patches only on sunny days with air temperature >12 degrees-13 degrees C, and foraging behavior and flower visitation rate were temperature dependent. Bees were able to fly at relatively low thoracic temperatures (T-th; range 22 degrees-31 degrees C) and this was essential for successfully foraging at N. longispathus. Under the range of irradiance and air temperature found at foraging sites, A. bicolor individuals inside flowers were able to reach T-th suitable for flight by passive means alone. Under laboratory conditions, A. bicolor was unable to raise or otherwise regulate T-th by physiological means, but free-flying individuals thermoregulated behaviorally. Basking was used to raise T-th and intrafloral microclimate, by influencing the proportion of foraging time devoted to basking, played an important role in thermoregulation. Flower visitation rate was positively related to the average temperature inside visited flowers, and the probability of basking immediately after one floral visit declined with increasing flower temperature. I conclude that the favorable microclimate within N. longispathus flowers, their long duration, and the thermal biology of A. bicolor, were critical elements in this early-season pollination system.

AB I compare patterns of larval anuran species occurrences in aquatic habitats to results from exclosure experiments of tadpoles across all available habitat types. The purpose of this study was to investigate habitat effects on larval anuran fitness measures in the absence of direct effects of predators and competitors in a central Amazonian rain forest. In this sense, this study tests species-habitat associations established in an earlier study (Gascon 1991).
   Fifty-three primary forest aquatic sites of four distinct types (stream, streamside, peccary wallows, and terra firme sites) were surveyed for 2 yr for larval anuran species presence. In separate transplant experiments, I monitored growth, survival, and development of four larval anuran species reared in mesh cages as a function of habitat type.
   Tadpoles of Osteocephalus taurinus occurred in all types of habitats, but had a significantly higher mean number of cohorts in high-lying sites (terra firme and wallows) compared to low-lying sites (streams and streamside pools). Hyla geographica was restricted to streamside sites. Epipedobates femoralis and Phyllomedusa tomopterna occurred only in high-lying natural sites (wallows and terra firme sites). When transplanted, O. taurinus did significantly better in high-lying sites than in low-lying ones. Hyla geographica did not perform significantly better in sites where it naturally occurred. Phyllomedusa tomopterna showed significantly lower survival in low-lying sites compared to high-lying ones. Finally, E. femoralis performed as well in streamside sites (where it never occurred naturally) as in high-lying sites.
   Occurrence patterns for P. tomopterna and O. taurinus were consistent with the transplant results. This suggests that these species occupy all habitats within their scope of physiological tolerance. Other factors, such as direct predation on larvae or interference competition, do not appear to account for the distribution of these species. For H. geographica and E. femoralis, results of transplants indicate that they do not perform better in their ''preferred'' habitat compared to unoccupied habitats.

AB Recent papers opposing ratio dependence focus on four main criticisms: (1) the empirical evidence we present is insufficient or biased, (2) ratio-dependent models exhibit pathological behavior, (3) ratio dependence lacks a logical or mechanistic base, and (4) more general models incorporate both prey and ratio dependence and there is no need for either of the two simplifications. We review these arguments in the light of empirical evidence from field and experimental studies. We argue that (1) empirical evidence shows that most natural systems are closer to ratio dependence than to prey dependence, (2) ''pathological'' dynamics in a mathematical sense is not only realistic, but the lack of such dynamics in prey-dependent models actually makes them pathological in a biological sense, (3) the mechanistic base of ratio dependence is (direct and indirect) interference and resource sharing, and (4) although more general models (with extra parameters) can never fit natural patterns worse than either prey- or ratio-dependent models, there are theoretical, practical, and pedagogical reasons for attempting to find simpler models that can capture the essential dynamics of natural systems.

AB We added seasonality to a general predator-prey model to make it a more realistic description of the interaction between microtine rodents (Microtus) and their mustelid predators (Mustela nivalis) in northern Europe. The model parameters were estimated from field data, with the exception of three parameters, for which a range of plausible values was selected. Most parameter combinations generated high-amplitude, chaotic oscillations with a distinct periodic component; the median parameter values predicted dynamics closely resembling the observed 3-5 yr rodent oscillations in northern Fennoscandia. The results were not sensitive to a number of structural changes in the model, suggested by empirical observations: stochastic variation in the prey-carrying capacity, predator refuge at low density, predation on mustelids by large generalist predators in the years when rodents decline, and an alternative assumption about winter breeding in rodents. The model-predicted period and amplitude of oscillations agreed most closely with observations when the model included a low-density refuge for the mustelids. Another predator-prey model with ratio-dependent functional response did not predict dynamics resembling the observed dynamics. The present results provide further support to the hypothesis that the rodent oscillations are maintained by delayed density dependence imposed by specialist predators. Our results also suggest that the dynamics may be chaotic, with a periodic component, rather than a limit cycle with environmental stochasticity.

AB The intermediate disturbance hypothesis predicts that richness will be highest in communities with moderate levels of disturbance and at intermediate rime spans following disturbance. This model was proposed as a nonequilibrium explanation of species richness in tropical forests and coral reefs. A second model of succession, initial floristic composition, states that nearly all species, including late seral species, are present at the start of succession. This leads to the prediction that richness should be highest immediately following disturbance. We tested these predictions using plant species composition data from two long-term field experiments in North American tallgrass prairie vegetation. In contrast to one prediction of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, there was a significant monotonic decline in species richness with increasing disturbance frequency, with no evidence of an optimum, in both field experiments. Species composition on an annually burned site was a subset of that of infrequently burned sites. The average number of species per quadrat and the number of grass, forb, and annual species were lowest on annually burned sites compared to unburned sites and sites burned once every 4 yr. The second prediction of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, however, was supported. Richness reached a maximum at an intermediate time interval since the last disturbance. This contradicts the prediction from the initial floristic composition model of succession. These results also suggest that the two predictions of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis are independent and unrelated. We propose that this may be explained by uncoupling the effects of disturbance as a single, relatively discrete event from system response to disturbance. From this perspective, disturbance becomes an extinction-causing event in these grasslands, whereas recovery following disturbance is a balance between immigration and extinction.

AB Comparative demographic studies of terrestrial vertebrates have included few samples of species from tropical forests. We analyzed 9 yr of mark-recapture data and estimated demographic parameters for 25 species of birds inhabiting lowland forests in. central Panama. These species were all songbirds (Order Passeriformes) ranging in mass from 7 to 57 g. Using Jolly-Seber stochastic models for open populations, we estimated annual survival rate, population size, and recruitment between sampling periods for each species. We then explored relationships between these parameters and attributes such as body size, phylogenetic affiliation, foraging guild, and social behavior. Larger birds had comparatively long life-spans and low recruitment, but body size was not associated with population size. After adjusting for effects of body size, we found no association between phylogenetic affiliation and any demographic trait. Ecological attributes, especially foraging guild, were more clearly associated with interspecific variation in all demographic traits. Ant-followers had comparatively long life-spans, but species that participate in flocks did not live longer than solitary species. The allometric associations we observed were consistent with those demonstrated in other studies of vertebrates; thus, these relationships appear to be robust. Our finding that ecological factors were more influential than phylogenetic affiliation contrasts with comparative studies of temperate-zone birds and suggests that the relative importance of environmental vs. historical factors varies geographically.

AB Elevational tree-limit change of Pinus sylvestris, Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa, and Alnus incana during the Holocene was studied from subfossil wood remains in the Scandes Mountains, Sweden. From 8250 yr BP to the present, the Pinus-limit descended at an average rate of 20 m per millennium (after adjustment for glacioisostatic land upheaval). In contrast, Betula and Alnus ascended until approximate to 3000 yr BP, whereafter an altitudinal decline is apparent. The relative abundance of Pinus in the tree-limit ecotone has decreased, while that of Betula increased throughout much of the Holocene. The present-day subalpine belt of Betula developed after 7000 yr BP in response to long-term cooling interacting with short-term climatic disturbance of pine stands. The inferred tree-limit histories are consistent with climatic model simulations of solar radiation and the atmospheric circulation for the Holocene (the Milankovitch theory). Based on the current climate requirements of the tree-limit species, an early Holocene summer thermal optimum approximate to 1.0 degrees C higher than present is inferred. Subsequently, tree-limit vegetation changed gradually, in dynamic equilibrium with progressive summer cooling and increasing humidity and snow cover, i.e., a decreasingly seasonal climate. Accelerated recession of Finns, indicative of abrupt cooling, is recorded for a short period around 7200 yr BP. A short-term advance of the Pinus tree-limit, presumably a consequence of climatic warming, occurred approximate to 4300 yr BP. Rapid and persistent reductions in the quantitative record of subfossils of all tree species, after 5500-5000 yr BP, may result from fragmentation of the tree-limit ecotone. This response is inferred as the combined effect of long- and short-term cooling passing a threshold, which initiated periglaciation, podzolization, and paludification.

AB In spite of the ubiquity of omnivory in nature, its consequences for population dynamics have received little attention from theoretical and experimental ecologists. Having three direct consumer-resource links, three indirect numerical links, and a potential for indirect effects mediated by size structure and/or behavioral flexibility, a three-species omnivory system may exhibit complex population dynamics. In 2 x 3 m field enclosures in the littoral zone of a lake, I manipulated the dominating native benthivorous fish (greater than or equal to 2yr-old perch, Perca fluviatilis, omnivorous top consumer) and the dominating native benthic invertebrate predators (Sialis lutaria, Megaloptera, and odonates, intermediate consumers) in three gradients: increasing densities of perch in the near absence of Sialis and odonates, and increasing densities of Sialis and odonates in either the presence or absence of perch. The densities of their common prey (mainly chironomids) were left unmanipulated. Macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass, and size structure, as well as gut contents of perch and Sialis were sampled monthly over a 3-mo summer period.
   In the absence of perch, the experimental gradient of Sialis densities remained unchanged over time. In the presence of perch, Sialis decreased by about half at high initial densities, but remained unchanged at low initial densities. Perch also had a negative effect on odonates. In the near absence of Sialis and odonates, perch had a strong, negative effect on chironomids. Compared to enclosures without perch, chironomid abundance was strongly reduced at the lowest perch density, but leveled off with further increases in perch density. Sialis and odonates did not affect chironomid abundance when perch were absent. In contrast, chironomid abundance was positively affected by Sialis and odonates when perch were present. The overall effect of perch on chironomid abundance in the presence of Sialis and odonates was negative.
   The combined predatory and competitive effects of perch on Sialis and odonates raise the issue how Sialis and odonates coexist with perch. The lack of effect of perch on Sialis and chironomids at low densities of these prey suggests that prey refuges contribute significantly to their persistence in natural systems. The indirect positive effect of Sialis and odonates on chironomids indicates density dependence in per capita interaction coefficients and is most likely to be explained by a behavioral response of perch or chironomids to Sialis and odonates. I suggest that the theoretical and empirical investigation of model systems (such as three-component omnivory systems), which are sufficiently simple to be analytically and experimentally tractable, but still display a richness of common indirect effects, will contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of more complex food webs. Their study will benefit from experimental manipulations of more than one population at more than two densities.

AB Heavy shade presents serious challenges for primary producers and food-limited herbivores in forest streams. In this study, we examined the response of periphyton and grazing snails (Elimia clavaeformis) to summer shade in White Oak Creek (WOC), a second-order stream in a Tennessee deciduous forest. Three experiments were performed: (1) in situ manipulation of light and snail density to test the effects of light limitation and grazing; (2) construction of photosynthesis-irradiance (P-I) curves to test for shade adaptation by periphyton; and (3) measurements of snail growth vs. irradiance, to quantify the indirect relationship between grazers and an abiotic constraint on photosynthesis. In the first experiment, light and snail densities were manipulated in a 2 x 2 factorial design: two light treatments were created by removing streamside vegetation from four sites in WOC and by pairing each of these sites with an adjacent, shaded site; two snail density treatments at each site were created by adding snails at normal (970 individuals/m(2)) and low (50 individuals/m(2)) density to the two sides of Plexiglas channels. Snails at normal densities cropped periphyton biomass to low levels regardless of light regime, but periphyton productivity was higher at the open sites where snails grew faster and accumulated more lipid. Snail growth and lipid accumulation were strongly affected by intraspecific competition in both light regimes. In the second experiment, photosynthesis-irradiance curves for periphyton from shaded and open sites illustrated considerable shade adaptation: shaded periphyton was 2 times more efficient at low irradiance than was periphyton from open sites. Despite the greater efficiency of shaded periphyton at low irradiance, integrated primary production estimated with photosynthetic models was 4 times greater in the open because shade adaptation provided only partial compensation for the very low irradiances in the shade. In the third experiment, in situ snail growth again increased with decreasing shade. The growth vs. irradiance response resembled a P-I curve: snail growth increased almost linearly with increased light and then leveled off at a photon flux density of approximate to 7 mol m(-2). d(-1). If this curve primarily reflects rates of food supply, then periphyton production and grazer growth in WOC and similar streams is light-limited at a photon flux density <7 mol m(-2). d(-1). Bottom-up effects of light limitation were propagated very strongly in WOC, where the invertebrate fauna is dominated by a grazer that appears to escape top-down control.

AB A predictive model for bryophyte distribution, water table position, and seasonal mean methane (CH4) emission was developed for two areas of northern peatland: the Clay Belt of Ontario and the Labrador Trough of Quebec. Water table position and CH4 flux were the most important environmental variables in canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) of bryophyte data. Water chemistry constituted a second environmental gradient, independent of hydrology and CH4 flux.
   Weighted averaging regression and calibration were used to develop a model for predicting log CH4 flux from bryophyte distribution. The model showed an increase in log CH4 flux from hummock to carpet and pool species, corresponding with a decrease in height above the mean water table position. The exceptions were rich-fen pool species, which had low CH4 flux optima in spite of their moisture status. Tolerances were greatest for mid-hummock species and least for carpet and pool species. No overlap in tolerances occurred between hummock and pool species, suggesting that species at either end of the height gradient are the best predictors of CH4 flux.
   Error analyses showed that bryophytes are equally as effective as water table position for predicting mean CH4 flux even though bryophytes are only surrogates for the degree of anaerobism/aerobism in the peat profile. Bryophytes are distributed in well-defined zones along microtopographic gradients; they integrate long-term changes in the water table, which fluctuates on a daily and seasonal basis along with CH4 flux, and may be more easily mapped with remote-sensing techniques. Bryophytes, however, are only useful for predicting CH4 flux within a region; similar species values cannot be extrapolated to other northern peatlands where different climatic and biogeochemical factors may result in different ranges of CH4 emission. The model may be used in paleoreconstructions of methane emission and for biological monitoring of climate change.

AB A plant's grazing history can influence the nutritional quality of its leaves and directly affect herbivore performance. In addition, leaf nutritional quality can indirectly affect herbivore performance by influencing food consumption, We examined the direct and indirect influences of prior grazing of Solidago missouriensis upon leaf nutritional quality and the growth and fecundity of Trirhabda canadensis (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). We fed leaves from both previously grazed (during 1988 and 1989) and ungrazed goldenrod plots derived from a single S. missouriensis clone to larvae and adults of T. concessions in laboratory performance trials. We computed standard insect performance indices and used structural equation modeling and path analysis to interpret the results of these trials, Prior grazing of goldenrod had a direct negative impact upon the growth of T, canadensis larvae in spring of 1990, a concomitant reduction in foliage consumption accentuated this effect, Larvae fed leaves from grazed plots accumulated biomass and N more slowly, used them less efficiently, and reached a lower final mass than did larvae fed leaves from plots without prior folivory. Goldenrods produced a new flush of leaves following larval grazing in the spring of 1990. Therefore, adults feeding in plots defoliated by larvae ate younger leaves than those feeding in undefoliated plots. Leaves from defoliated plots had direct positive impacts upon the growth and egg production of adult T. canadensis. Adults converted these young leaves into biomass with greater efficiency and preferred them to older leaves from ungrazed plots in choice tests. However, negative indirect effects of prior grazing upon initial adult mass and total foliage consumption negated any positive influence that these more nutritious leaves had upon growth, and made the overall impact of prior grazing upon egg production negative, These results indicate that impacts of food availability and quality must be considered jointly to understand how prior grazing influences herbivore performance.

AB Larval chorus frogs (Pseudacris triseriata) and spring peepers (P. crucifer) show marked differences in their distribution patterns, with chorus frogs tending to occur in less permanent ponds containing lower predator densities, and spring peepers tending to occur in more permanent ponds with higher predator densities. In order to understand this pattern I performed experiments at two levels. First, at the community level, I evaluated the importance of competition, predation, and pond permanence for patterns of larval performance. Second, at the behavioral level, I asked whether a hypothesized trade-off between gain and risk underlies ecological interactions, and ultimately, patterns of performance and distribution of these species.
   I employed a field manipulation to assess the contributions of competition and predation within different ponds that varied in permanence. In order to examine the effect of interspecific competition, enclosures contained each tadpole species either alone or in the presence of an equal density of the other species; these enclosures were placed in two temporary ponds, two intermediate ponds, and two permanent ponds. Tadpole stocking densities reflected local natural densities. This competition treatment was crossed with a predator treatment manipulating the absence or presence of predators (with ''presence'' representing the naturally occurring density within each pond). Patterns of relative performance were consistent with relative distribution patterns across the pond permanence gradient: chorus frogs performed best relative to spring peepers in temporary ponds while spring peepers performed best relative to chorus frogs in permanent ponds (performance was measured as survivorship and growth). The dominant sources of mortality were pond drying in temporary ponds and predation in more permanent ponds. In contrast to most previous experimental studies of larval anurans, competition had small effects on tadpole performance.
   Results from the held experiment suggest that pond drying and predation may be important determinants of performance, and that the two species are differentially susceptible to these mortality agents. In a set of laboratory experiments I evaluated the hypothesis that a trade-off between foraging gain and predation risk mediated through activity (proportion of time spent moving) might explain patterns of Pseudacris distribution. In both species, individuals facultatively reduced activity in the presence of a caged predator with a corresponding drop in growth rate. In general, larval chorus frogs also tend to be more active and faster growing and developing than spring peepers. These results provide support for the existence of the trade-off and suggest that interspecific differences in activity may contribute to patterns of larval performance and distribution among ponds. The general nature of this trade-off suggests that it may also be important in other systems.
