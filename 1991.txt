AB Earthworms represent the dominant fraction of soil macroinvertebrate biomass in Kansas tallgrass prairie and thus may have a large impact on nutrient budgets. To evaluate this impact I estimated cast production and rates of nutrient processing by the native genus Diplocardia and by exotic Lumbricidae in permanent plots on two soil types at Konza Prairie Research Natural Area. Total cast production was estimated from field population estimates, soil climate data, and cast production-temperature relationships obtained in the laboratory. The organic matter and mineral N and P contents of surface casts by month were used to estimate total processing of these substances in the field. Earthworms present in the study sites were Diplocardia longiseta, D. kansensis, D. rugosa, D. singularis, D. smithii, D. verrucosa, and the European species Aporrectodea caliginosa and Octolasion cyaneum. Estimated total cast production and nutrient processing by Diplocardia spp. exceeded that of exotics in both soil types, in spite of higher populations of Lumbricidae in one soil. Total annual soil consumption by all earthworms was 4-10% of the A-horizon, depending on soil type. Organic matter equivalent to 10% of total soil organic matter in the top 15 cm or to 100-300% of plant annual belowground production appears to pass through the earthworms each year. Mineral N processed was almost-equal-to 10-12% of annual plant N uptake, comparable to half of the input from precipitation, while the P processed was equivalent to 50% of annual uptake. In contrast to other grassland systems studied, the introduction of Lumbricidae had a negative effect on soil turnover and nutrient mineralization due to the lower throughput of Lumbricidae and their relative intolerance of summer soil temperatures.

AB The aspen blotch miner, Phyllonorycter salicifoliella, has occurred at extremely high, "epidemic" densities on its quaking aspen host trees for at least 10 yr in Itasca State Park, Minnesota, USA. During the 1986 through 1988 growing seasons, I censused density, survival, and sources of mortality for eggs, larvae, and pupae on branches at two heights on four host trees. I constructed cohort life tables to determine: (1) dominant sources of mortality, and (2) which sources of mortality were spatially density dependent. The impact of parasitism on leaf miner success was also measured by excluding parasitoids with cages from four trees in 1986.
   Most mortality occurred during larval development and was caused by interference, parasitism, and unknown causes. Interference means that one larva kills another when mines coalesce during the first three instars. Egg mortality, predation, and death from premature leaf abscission were generally low, except in 1988 when a severe drought caused significant early leaf fall.
   I tested if dominant sources of mortality were density dependent at four spatial scales: per leaf, twig, branch, and tree. Larval interference was the only consistently density-dependent cause of death. No between-trophic-level interactions imposed density-dependent mortality.
   Although interference was spatially density dependent, it appears incapable of regulating P. salicifoliella population size. Instead, P. salicifoliella densities approached population "ceilings" delimited each year by availability of young leaves during oviposition. Cessation of the outbreak is unlikely until stochastic meteorological events increase overwintering mortality and/or severely disrupt synchrony between oviposition flights and availability of young foliage.

AB Populations of the lizard Anolis limifrons were censused for 19 yr at the Lutz site on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) and for 4 yr at 20 additional sites in central Panama. Census data provided estimates of population density at the end of the wet season (December) and indices of per-capita food intake and annual recruitment. Year-to-year changes in density of as much as 5- to 8-fold were observed at Lutz over 19 yr and of 2- to 3-fold were observed over 4 yr at other sites. Changes in population density at 11 BCI sites were synchronous over 1983-1986, while population density fluctuated independently at non-BCI sites. Populations of A. limifrons exhibited significantly greater generation-to-generation variability than populations of West Indian Anolis and of lizards in temperate-zone habitats (mostly arid lands in North America). An index of per-capita food intake was negatively related to density both for temporal comparisons at Lutz and for spatial comparisons among sites. The relative number of young individuals at the end of the wet season was negatively related to population density and positively related to an estimate of food intake. Partial correlations indicated that the positive association between the relative number of young individuals in the population and food intake was independent of the negative association between food intake and population density. Recruitment was thus depressed when density was high and enhanced when food was relatively abundant. Despite the potential for density-dependent regulation, Anolis limifrons populations are highly unstable, presumably because of random perturbations of the environment. Rainfall is implicated causally although population density was only weakly associated with rainfall - density at BCI was positively associated with rainfall during the dry season and negatively associated with rainfall during the wet season and with total annual rainfall. Population attributes that contribute to instability are rapid population turnover and a middle-level trophic position in a complex food web.

AB Foraging decisions by large herbivores in a heterogenous environment with several available plant species are a scale problem. If, for example, the foraging decisions primarily occur at the stand level, then stands of trees might be regarded as patches within a habitat of several stands over which intake rate is to be maximized. The food consumption within a stand should be in proportion to the availability of different food types. If, on the other hand, food selection occurs at the tree level within a stand, then the individual trees are regarded as "patches"; total stand exploitation should then be the result of foraging decisions made within the stand. We tested these two hypotheses in field experiments in winter with free-ranging moose (Alces alces) having access to artificial stands of trees. In these stands Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) was mixed with either aspen (Populus tremula) or alder (Alnus incana). In experiment A, where the total available pine biomass per stand was much greater than any of the additional species, total stand consumption did not differ between stand types. In experiment B, where pine biomass did not dominate to the same extent, pine + aspen stands were more heavily used than pine + pine and pine + alder stands. The within-stand consumption of different species appeared to be nonrandom, i.e., the tree biomass was not consumed in proportion to availability. The mean pine biomass consumption per tree did not differ between stand types in either experiment. We conclude that the food selection appears to occur primarily at the tree level within stands. The level of decision might also be important for the performance of the plant species exploited. The results from this study question the general validity of recent hypotheses regarding "associational protection" in plant communities. We suggest that the optimal patch use approach taken in this study might give better insight in these kinds of plant-animal interaction problems.

AB We used a hierarchical approach to investigate the relationships among within- and between-year variation in precipitation and temperature in the northern Great Basin and components of reproductive success in two species of common shrubsteppe sparrows. During a 5-yr period we monitored clutch sizes, brood sizes, and fledging success in Sage (Amphispiza belli) and Brewer's (Spizella breweri) Sparrows in shrubsteppe habitat in central Oregon.
   During the 5 yr of our study, the Pacific Northwest experienced precipitation extremes, with the driest bioyear (October-April) in 65 yr of records (1976-1977) followed by one of the wettest. Within each breeding season daily temperature and precipitation fluctuated widely and in most cases unpredictably over a scale of a few days.
   Both species achieved significantly greater final reproductive success (as measured by number of fledglings produced) in wetter, presumably more biologically productive years. In Brewer's Sparrows this was achieved through higher clutch sizes in wetter years, whereas Sage Sparrows had higher hatching rates. For Sage Sparrows, within-year weather variables accounted for a significant amount of variation in reproductive parameters beyond that statistically explained by bioyear precipitation alone. However, in Brewer's Sparrows addition of within-year weather variables was not significant, and thus this species appeared buffered from the effects of short-term variation in abiotic conditions.
   The observed patterns suggested that clutch-size variation in Brewer's Sparrows may represent adaptive flexibility, the ability to assess potentially favorable environmental conditions and adjust reproductive investment accordingly. In contrast, in Sage Sparrows the association between bioyear precipitation and final reproductive success seemed most likely to be a proximate consequence of resource availability at the time of oogenesis, and to be further modified by the effects of weather that each nest experienced.

AB This paper presents a life table for the common mud turtle, Kinosternon subrubrum, in a fluctuating aquatic habitat on the Upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina, USA, using data gathered in a 20-yr mark-recapture study. Data on survivorship and fecundity (clutch size, per capita clutch frequency) were assessed and compared to previously published life table statistics for the slider turtle, Trachemys scripta, in the same body of water and for the yellow mud turtle, K. flavescens, in Nebraska.
   The annual survival rate for adult female Kinosternon (87.6%) is significantly higher than that of adult female Trachemys (77.4%). Similarly, male Kinosternon exhibit an annual survival rate (89.0%) significantly higher than that of male Trachemys (83.4%). The mean annual proportion of female Kinosternon that are reproductively active (50.7%) also is significantly higher than that of Trachemys (37.2%). In addition, survival rate from the time eggs are laid by Kinosternon until the hatchlings enter the aquatic environment (26.1 %) is significantly higher than that for Trachemys (10.5%).
   Comparisons of our findings with those for K. flavescens indicate that these geographically separate populations of congeneric species also differ substantially in age at maturity, mean generation time, and the mean proportion of females that are reproductively active in any given year. Differences were also apparent in mean clutch frequencies and adult survival rates. The differences in life history traits between the two geographically separated populations of congeners seem to be as great as those between the two syntopic populations representing different families (Kinosternidae: K. subrubrum and Emydidae: Trachemys scripta). The comparison of life tables for two species from different families having different ecological and evolutionary histories, but living in the same habitat, and of congeneric species in different habitats, is instructive regarding the biological flexibility of species under natural conditions. However, the study suggests that environmental variability has a greater effect on life table statistics than do phylogenetic relationships.

AB This is the first study reporting patterns of island occupancy in a guild of mammals with detailed information on the processes affecting these patterns: dispersal, colonization, and extinction. We surveyed the presence of three species of shrews, Sorex araneus, S. caecutiens, and S. minutus, on 108 islands in three lakes in Finland. A significant compensatory effect between island area and isolation was detected in one species, but most islands were so little isolated (< 1 km) that isolation played no great role in this study. The position and the slope of the incidence function varied greatly among the species. Fitting the model J = 1/(1 + y/A(x)) to the observed incidence functions, and assuming that the annual extinction probability is 1 on islands of A = 0.5 ha, yielded quantitative predictions of the rates of colonization and extinction in the three species. Observed rates agreed remarkably well with the predicted ones (median difference 200/o). Overwater dispersal rate and/or ability was lowest in the smallest species (S. minutus), probably because of its short starvation time and slow swimming rate. Unexpectedly, this species had the highest colonization ability (rate of successful colonization conditional on arriving at an island). There were no significant differences between the species in colonization rate, but interspecific differences in extinction rate were highly significant and negatively correlated with body size. We suggest that these differences are due to increasing importance of environmental stochasticity with decreasing body size in shrews. This hypothesis is supported by larger coefficients of variation of abundance in small than in large species on the mainland.

AB Sympatric, conspecific animals may use resources in different ways: a population of foragers with a generalist diet may be composed of polyphagous individuals or of different types of oligophagous individuals. The sea slug Placida dendritica (Opisthobranchia: Ascoglossa) exhibited the latter pattern. Individual slugs from different green algal host species exhibited different rank preferences of and performances on host species. Feeding preferences did not change through time and were independent of Placida size. In addition, the slug's highly rigid feeding specificity was not modified through hunger level, algal condition, or social interactions with experienced conspecifics. Thus, Placida frequently died when maintained on "unfamiliar" host species that sympatric conspecifics consumed. The extreme trophic specialization of Placida suggests that the costs of switching host species may be extremely high in short-lived foragers.

AB Diet selection and optimization may be affected by nonadditive interactions (or associative effects) among ingested diet items. Associative effects occur when one diet item affects the digestion (either positively or negatively) of another diet item. Feeding trials were conducted with an opportunistic omnivore, the yellow-bellied slider turtle (Trachemys scripta scripta), on three diets: duckweed, insect larvae, and duckweed/larvae mix. Diet had a significant effect on digestibilities and intake, but not on transit time.
   There was a significant associative effect in the duckweed/larvae diet. For all diet components except lipids, the digestive efficiencies measured in the duckweed/larvae diet were significantly greater than those predicted from the digestive efficiencies for duckweed and larvae diets when fed alone. The presence of larvae in the digesta significantly improved the digestive processing of duckweed, probably by supporting greater numbers or diversity of cellulolytic microbes. A given mass of duckweed provided almost-equal-to 70% more energy and 20% more nitrogen to the turtle when ingested with insect larvae than when ingested alone.
   Associative effects should be incorporated in optimal foraging models and studies of diet selection because the value of a diet item can vary with the foods with which it is ingested. The assigned value must include not only the direct nutritional gain from the item, but also the indirect nutritional gain (or loss) through positive (or negative) effects on digestion of food items with which it is ingested.

AB Males of many iguanid lizard species defend territories against conspecific males. We investigated whether territoriality in male sagebrush lizards (Sceloporus graciosus) was associated with defense of mates. Studies on the sagebrush lizard in western Colorado, USA, included mark-recapture census and removal of adult females from the territories of resident males. Adults and juveniles were clearly distinguished by body size. Resident males did not abandon their territories following the removal of adult females. Resident males did not expand the size of their territories following the loss of adult females. Males were not defending juvenile females because most male territories did not include juvenile females. Sagebrush lizards are long lived, and territory defense probably ensures several mating opportunities. We postulate that loss of a mate in one season may be less important than the long-term benefits of territory maintenance and repeated reproduction.

AB We used multivariate ordination techniques to establish relationships among the abundances of the most frequently occurring littoral zone fishes (fishes that occurred in > 60% of the lakes) in 25 central Ontario lakes. Previously, most large-scale comparative studies of freshwater fish communities only measured species presence/absence. Abundance estimates provide an alternative, and perhaps more sensitive, means of assessing the relative importance of biotic processes, geological/chemical factors, and historical determinants of present-day community structure.
   Seventy percent of the variation in abundances was described by the first two axes from a correspondence analysis. Abundances of white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) and rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris), and abundances of brown bullhead (Ictalurus nebulosus) and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieui) were negatively related. However, abundances of these species pairs were not related where the species occurred in sympatry, suggesting that species presence/absence strongly influenced these patterns of abundance.
   Most of the variation in species abundance and distribution was attributed to physical factors associated with species colonization processes (i.e., differences in postglacial colonization rates may have caused negative associations between white sucker and rock bass). An independent 45-lake data set was used to confirm these zoogeographic patterns. Predation by northern pike (Esox lucius) may be partly responsible for variation in abundance and distribution of white sucker. Where pike and sucker co-exist, sucker abundance is lower than where sucker exist without pike. Habitat differences between lakes provided the best explanation for the variation in abundance of smallmouth bass and brown bullhead. Biogeographic processes, physical environmental factors, and predatory processes have been very influential in shaping abundances and distributions of ubiquitous littoral zone fishes in Ontario.

AB We used a series of fenced exclosures to examine whether herbivory by mammals affected the structure and dynamics of an old-field plant community in Virginia. Early in the 3rd yr of the study purple clover, Trifolium pratense, a dominant member of the plant community, occurred at higher densities where herbivores were excluded relative to control plots. Following a 1-mo time lag, Trifolium became infected by the rust-forming fungal pathogen Uromyces trifolii; the incidence of infection was higher in exclosures relative to control plots where herbivores were present. Early-to-late season changes in the abundance of Trifolium were related to the degree of fungal infection and not herbivore presence/ absence. Data from the following year (when the fungus and Trifolium were rare) showed clover abundance to be higher in control plots than in exclosures. These results suggest that the negative influence of the fungus not only persisted through time, but more strongly affected host plant abundance in a 2-mo period than did herbivory that occurred in both years. While the direct effect of herbivory on food plants is negative, by keeping plant abundance below that at which fungal infections become epidemic, the net effect of herbivores on some forage plants may be positive. The existence of strong indirect interactions is further evidence that the emphasis in community ecology (and in plant succession) should be on interactive networks rather than on species pairs.

AB Fish assemblage patterns were examined in 40 dry-season pools in a hydrologically variable river drainage in northeast Texas, to test the hypothesis that fish assemblage structure is correlated with environmental gradients of habitat characteristics.  The study focused on two questions:  1. Do discrete, identifiable fish assemblage patterns exist?  2. If so, how are they related to environmental conditions?
   The null hypothesis that fishes were randomly distributed among pools was rejected, indicating that assemblage patterns existed.  Cluster anlayses of the relative abundance of fish species detected three fish assemblages dominated by:  mosquitofish; bullhead; and sunfish-shiner-mosquitofish.  Factor analysis reduced environmental variables to six factors representing pool depth, pool persistence, channel size, canopy cover, pool substrate, and pH, by which assemblages could be discriminated.  These results demonstrated a relation between fish assemblages structure and environmental conditions in the pools.  The discriminating variables varied along a gradient, and fish assemblages varied similarly.  The study supported model predictions for gradient trends in species richness, species composition, fish size, and fish density, but not for species density.

AB The purpose of this study was to partition the components of a mixed fire frequency, and empirically relate these components to temporal and spatial differences in fire frequency.  The method of reconstructing the fire frequency was to build a stand-origin map, from this estimate the mixed time-since-fire distribution, and then use a graphic technique to partition the mixed distribution into two homogeneous fire-frequency distributions.
   The fire frequency for the last 380 yr in the 495-km2 Kananaskis Watershed showed a temporal change in fire frequency at almost-equal-to 1730.  This change in fire frequency is related to a change from a warmer and drier climate before 1730 to a cooler and moister climate since then.  When the fire-frequency data were partitioned by a graphic technique, the two resulting fire frequencies fit negative exponential distributions.  For the period 1730-1980 the fire cycle (the time required to burn an area equal to the area of study, or one divided by the scale parameter of the exponential distribution) was 90 yr.  For the period before 1730 the fire cycle was 50 yr.  The Watershed could not be subdivided into smaller, spatially homogeneous fire-frequency units.  The negative exponential distribution of fire frequencies suggests a constant hazard function (mortality force).  This constant hazard was corroborated by a spatial correlation (Moran's I) test which found no spatial pattern other than ones expected by chance between forest ages on either side of all fire boundaries.  Thus, there was no tendency for young stands to be associated either with only younger- or only older-aged stands.  Other studies on fire behavior in the Watershed corroborate the short fire cycle, constant hazard, and lack of spatial fire-frequency differences, and suggest that the regional climate control of the temporal fire frequency is related to a characteristic synoptic weather pattern and the resulting high intensity and high rate-of-spread of fires.

AB Removal of 25 or 75% of leaf or root tissue, and 25% of both, was used to simulate above- and belowground herbivory on Tragopogon dubius.  Plants with 25% of their leaf tissue removed did not differ significantly from controls in total biomass; those with any root tissue trimmed produced significantly less biomass while the 75% leaf removal treatment was intermediate.  A similar pattern was exhibited for plant mortality and flower production.  Plants that had one or more flowers removed by herbivores grew significantly larger and produced significantly more flowers than plants that lost no flowers, regardless of treatment.
   The greatest differences between treatments in nutrient allocation patterns occurred 1 d after manipulations were applied.  Subsequently, differences between treatments moderated, and values tended to converge by 98 d postmanipulation, when the plants were harvested.  Seeds had significantly higher nitrogen concentration levels than leaf or root tissue.

AB Current ecological theory hypothesizes that boundaries between adjacent ecosystem units are important in determining ecosystem structure and function across heterogeneous landscapes, and that such boundaries are potentially important sites for early detection of global climate change effects. Hence, there is an increasing research effort to elucidate the structure and function of ecological boundaries. Yet traditional data analysis methods focus primarily on homogeneous units rather than on the boundaries between them; thus, new methods are being developed for detecting, characterizing and classifying boundaries, e.g., split moving-window boundary analysis (SMW). SMW is a simple yet sensitive method for locating discontinuities that may exist within multivariate, serial data (ordered in one dimension) at various scales relative to the length of the data series. However, SMW is subjective and relative, and therefore locates apparent discontinuities even within random, serial data. In this paper we present two nonparametric methods for determining the statistical significance of discontinuities detected by SMW. First, we describe a Monte Carlo method for determining the statistical significance of scale-dependent discontinuities (i.e., discontinuities that are significant relative to only one scale). Second, we propose a nonparametric, scale-independent method (it also is dependent upon scale size, but to a much lesser degree than the Monte Carlo method) that is more appropriate for locating statistically significant discontinuities that separate different, relatively homogeneous groups of varying size along a series. We examine the robustness of these two methods using computer-generated data having varying intensities of imposed discontinuities, and illustrate their application to locating boundaries between vegetation samples collected at systematic intervals across a desert landscape in southern New Mexico, USA.

AB I applied an observational approach, using strip transects, to document the abundance and the spatial distributions of members of an assemblage of subtidal fishes (Scorpaeniformes: Cottidae) in the San Juan Islands, Washington, USA. I then assessed the extent to which species-specific distributions were correlated with habitat availability and the potential for interspecific competition to modify patterns of abundance and resource use. The six common cottid species were Artedius fenestralis, A. harringtoni, Asemichthys taylori, Chitonotus pugetensis, Icelinus borealis, and Jordania zonope. A comparison of their observed distributions with the distributions of microhabitats along the transects revealed that all species demonstrated significant affinities for or avoidance of many of the predominant substrates: clean rock, silt rock, shell sand, gravel, mud, and algae. Using a stepwise regression technique, I found that the densities of individual cottid species were significantly correlated with the percentage cover of these substrate types along the transects and with transect depth.
   Several lines of evidence suggest that interspecific competition does not play a strong role in this assemblage. Species pairs that co-occurred on at least some transects did not show disjunct distributions. Microhabitat overlap of these species pairs was higher in sympatry (comparison of transects with both species present) than in allopatry (comparisons of transects with only one species present), counter to the expectation of niche divergence. Correlations of species densities after correcting for habitat heterogeneity with the Schoener-Crowell-Pimm technique revealed only one significant negative density correlation out of thirty potential correlations. Cottid diversity was not correlated with structural diversity along transects in spite of strong associations of each species with habitat structure. This suggests that the transect areas were undersaturated in the number of individuals and/or species of cottid fishes. The apparent lack of competition among subtidal cottids contrasts with studies on intertidal fish communities dominated by cottids for which there is observational evidence of interspecific competition.

AB We examined the effect of predators, competitors, and conspecifics on the choice of calling sites by male gray treefrogs, Hyla chrysoscelis, and the correlations between choice of calling sites by males and choice of oviposition sites by females.  The experiment was conducted in an array of wading pools and utilized a replicated block design for variance analysis.  Pools were open to natural colonization by male and female treefrogs.  The treatments consisted of controls containing no predators or competitors, four treatments containing one species of predator (either Ambystoma maculatum larvae, Enneacanthus chaetodon adults, Notophthalmus viridescens adults, or Tramea carolina larvae), and two treatments containing one species of competitor (either Rana catesbeiana or Hyla chrysoscelis).  Male and female treefrogs avoided pools containing conspecific tadpoles and pools containing adult black-banded sunfish, Enneacanthus chaetodon.  Females also avoided pools containing larval spotted salamanders, Ambystoma maculatum.  Correspondence between calling sites and oviposition sites was examined in response to treatment, block (consisting of a location and a time), and location.  Correspondence between male choices and female choices was weak.  Number and location of calling males showed no significant correlation with the number and location of eggs along any of the axes of choice.
   Both males and females chose sites based on the species present, and both showed preferences in regard to location and time.  The differences between male and female choices indicate that the potential choices have different values of each sex, or that different criteria are used to rank potential choices.  Anuran reproductive behavior is not a simple consequence of the direct interactions between males and females, but is a result of complex interactions between the behavior of the two sexes and the environment in which their behavior is embedded.

AB This paper analyzes the correlation between leaf orientation and the environmental conditions that prevail within the biogeographic range of each of the four South American Larrea species (L. ameghinoi, L. cuneifolia, L. divaricata, and L. nitida; Zygophyllaceae).
   Data on the distribution of Larrea species were gathered from herbarium specimens.  Measurements of leaf orientation were made throughout the Monte Desert, and in more detail in northern Patagonia, where the four species coexist.  The direct solar radiation intercepted by the unshaded leaves of each species was estimated through a computer model and plotted as a function of the hourly time for the summer and winter solstices.
   L. ameghinoi presents horizontal leaves and prostrate growth, characters which allow its development on sites that are exposed to the Patagonian westerlies.  The species, however, is an inefficient light interceptor in winter and early spring, when moisture conditions are adequate in Patagonia.  Its architecture is the result of selection for cushion-type, wind-resistant forms, at the expense of light interception.  It is restricted to windy, open areas of the Patagonian steppe.
   L. cuneifolia shows erect, east-facing leaves and branches, which maximize interception in the early morning and late afternoon, keeping noon interception at a minimum.  It can tolerate very hot environments by physically evading the midday sun and intercepting more early morning and late afternoon light.  It colonizes the hotter and drier parts of the Monte Desert.
   L. divaricata has divaricate leaves with folioles uniformly distributed in all azimuthal directions, and showing an inclination of around 70-degrees.  Although it never shows maximum light interception efficiencies, it performs relatively well in all seasons and at all hours of the day.  Its distribution is wide, not only in the arid Monte, but reaching also the Chaco woodlands and the Pacific coastal deserts.
   L. nitida shows erect, north-facing leaves and branches.  Its leaf orientation distribution allows the gradual warming of the leaf surfaces during the morning, with a maximum light interception near winter noons.  The species grows in the Patagonian Monte and on the slopes of the Andes.  Its general affinity with the colder west side of the Patagonian and Monte Deserts links its distribution with winter-type rains of Pacific origin.
   The results suggest that the contrasting leaf orientations of the four South American Larrea species reflect, the prevalent selective conditions endured under long periods in isolation, and that leaf orientation is an adaptive character that influences the habitat specificity of the different species.

AB The herbivorous sea slug Placida dendritica (Gastropoda: Opisthobranchia: Ascoglossa) formed feeding groups on the coenocytic green algae Codium setchellii and C fragile, but not on the related green alga Bryopsis corticulans. The trophic implications of Placida congregation were examined in a series of laboratory experiments. The effect of group membership on Placida growth depended on the number and relative sizes of individuals in the group. Members of Placida congregations composed of similar-sized individuals grew significantly faster than single individuals. In mixed-sized congregations, however, trophic benefits were not shared equally among all members. Small slugs always benefited from the presence of conspecifics, small or large; large slugs, however, benefited only if conspecifics were comparable in size. Small Placida tended to reduce the growth rate of large conspecifics. Although the mechanisms of intraspecific facilitation and competition among group members were only partially elucidated, a slug's feeding not only stimulated other group members to feed but also modified algal condition, enhancing feeding and growth of conspecifics.

AB Many vertebrate populations exhibit large variation in natal dispersal distances. Murray (1967) showed by simulation that this variation need not have a genetic basis, but could result from two factors, chance variation in proximity to suitable sites, and competition with sibs and neighbors for those sites. Waser (1985) developed an analytic model of the first of these effects, which predicts the probability that an individual will locate an available site within any given distance, under two limiting search strategies. We extend the model to consider the distances traveled by multiple dispersers from a site, under both search strategies, and show that competitive exclusion by early dispersers can further increase the variation in dispersal distances. This incorporates the effects of competition with siblings, but not with dispersers from other natal sites, and brings us part way toward an analytic solution to Murray's original model. In addition, we discuss both the difficulties inherent in testing models of dispersal, and the importance of doing so for the understanding of various behavioral, population, and evolutionary processes.

AB The relationship between movement and population dynamics in heterogeneous environments has been approached from two directions: theoretical analyses using diffusion models and empirical studies that often employ computer simulations. In this paper I am proposing a unified framework for studying individual movements that brings both of these approaches together. The proposed framework is based on the "diffusion-approximation" procedure developed by Patlak (1953a, b), which translates a probabilistic description of the pattern of individual movements (such as provided by simulation models) into a partial differential model describing the population redistribution in a patchy habitat.
   My first goal in this paper was to make Patlak's work accessible to ecologists interested in realistic movement models. Secondly, making some simplifying assumptions I solved Patlak's model to obtain the equilibrium distribution of organisms among patches in a heterogeneous environment. This led me to a definition of "residence index." The residence index of a patch is estimated by observing and recording movement trajectories of organisms within the patch. The pattern of variation in the residence index among different kinds of patches specifies the predicted equilibrium densities of organisms in each patch.
   I assessed the utility of the above approach by using data on movement tracks of Euphydryas anicia females to calculate butterfly residence indices in host-plant patches vs. nonhost environment. The predicted distribution of butterflies among host and nonhost areas differed by only 16% from the actual distribution, as documented by an independent data set. I also applied the model to data from three studies on insect movement and spatial distribution. The accuracy of model predictions varied from adequate to excellent.
   Finally, I argue that Patlak's model and its residence-index extension provides a general, and at the same time realistic, framework for quantifying individual movements, and for relating movement patterns to spatial population dynamics. Although this approach, as developed here, is explicitly concerned only with population redistribution within an area, birth/death or immigration/emigration terms can be added in a straightforward manner. Thus, this framework can be very useful in studies of consumer-resource (e.g., predator-prey or herbivore-host) spatial dynamics, since movement behaviors of consumers searching for prey, and prey attempting to avoid consumers, are known to be important in affecting the outcome of such population interactions.

AB We report on the interaction between reproduction and subsequent reproductive and vegetative growth in female plants of a dioecious, early successional, tall shrub, the feltleaf willow (Salix alaxensis).  We measured natural variation among individuals in flowering, and its correlation with subsequent shoot growth and flowering.  We also experimentally curtailed reproductive allocation in two ways:  (1) by removing inflorescence buds in April when plants were dormant, and (2) by covering inflorescences to prevent pollination and fruit development.  We hypothesized that these treatments would cause manipulated plants to retain more resources and to deploy them subsequently in shoot growth or reproduction.  However, treatment had no significant effect upon shoot elongation, which decreased slightly after floral buds were removed.  Treatments did significantly increase the fraction of buds differentiating as inflorescences instead of shoots.  We compared the experimental outcome with the natural, phenotypic variation among plants.  Among plants of either the treated or the unmanipulated groups, there was a significant negative correlation between current reproduction and subsequent growth; the corresponding regressions did not differ between the two groups.  Thus, natural phenotypic variation suggested a trade-off between reproduction and growth, but a direct test by experiment revealed only a trade-off between current and future reproduction.  Furthermore, the negative correlation seen in unmanipulated plants was unaffected by treatments curtailing reproductive investment.  We conclude that this correlation is not directly related to allocation constraints, and does not provide reliable evidence about costs of reproduction.  The increased commitment to flowering that occurred after experimental reduction of current reproductive investment may be evidence for a cost of reproduction, although the response need not have been caused directly by resource allocation constraints.

AB Nine years of demographic data for two unmanipulated populations of banner-tailed kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spectabilis) in Arizona provide measures of survival, fecundity, age structure, and density.  We use these data to search for costs of reproduction in two important components of fitness:  survival and future fecundity.  We also examine the interaction effects among reproductive effort, age, sex, and density on survival and future fecundity.  None of the analyses reveals a significant negative effect of reproductive effort on survival or future fecundity.  This result may be seen as evidence that reproduction has no measureable costs in fitness for bannertails.  However, another explanation is that bannertails adjust their reproductive effort to individual circumstances so as to minimize costs.

AB Trophic bottleneck, which is a common phenomenon in the pelagic food chains of large tropical lakes, was studied in Lake Valencia, a large and eutrophic lake located in Venezuela. Mechanisms of trophic bottleneck in lake Valencia were demonstrated through two years of population studies of Xenomelaniris venezuelae, a small planktivorous fish that accounts for most of the zooplankton consumption in open water. Major components of variation in abundance of Xenomelaniris included small-scale spatial (0.1-1.0 km, 70%), large-scale spatial (1-10 km, 23%), and temporal (months, seasons, 7%).
   The population showed a repeated annual cycle based primarily on a dominant cohort recruited during January and February. Spawning in the littoral zone continued throughout the year, but larvae survived only when rotifer densities exceeded 100 individuals/L, which occurred predictably during late seasonal mixing, but only irregularly thereafter. Steady mortality (15%/mo) of spawning fish occurred through predation. Catastrophic, predictable mortality of all fish occurred through anoxia during early seasonal mixing (57%/mo for two months).
   Xenomelaniris showed a strong ontogenetic shift in diet from rotifers during early development to copepods and Chaoborus during later development. Daily rations ranged from 28% of dry body mass in the smallest fish to 10% in the largest. Although Xenomelaniris was the only planktivore and was capable of consuming all major zooplankton taxa, it consumed only 3.6% of zooplankton production because it was never sufficiently abundant to exploit its food resource fully.
   Total growth of adult Xenomelaniris (somatic plus reproductive) conformed to the same equation as somatic growth of juveniles; growth potential was diverted increasingly to reproduction as the fish aged. Young adult fish showed 66% assimilation efficiency and 11% growth efficiency. Respiration losses decreased during development as the 0.73 power of body mass. The annual ratio of production to biomass was high (4.0), reflecting food sufficiency, a long growing season, and continuous loss of older fish to spawning mortality.
   Annual fresh-mass production of Xenomelaniris (31 kg/ha) is a small proportion of primary production (< 0.03%) and of zooplankton production (3.6%); energy budgets show that actual Xenomelaniris production is only one third of potential production given the observed zooplankton production and the measured growth efficiency of Xenomelaniris. The explanation of this trophic bottleneck is mortality, which prevents the population from reaching carrying capacity and thus blocks energy flow between zooplankton and pelagic fish. Although there were three significant kinds of mortality, larval mortality - apparently through starvation - was the explanation of the trophic bottleneck because it restricted the reproductive output of Xenomelaniris, which could otherwise have brought the population to carrying capacity. The trophic bottleneck may be of significance beyond Lake Valencia, in view of the low diversity and abundance of pelagic planktivores in tropical lakes.

AB We evaluated the importance of dissolved organic matter as a vehicle for the movement of N and P from the canopy and the forest floor into the mineral soil of a deciduous forest.  We also examined the origin and nature of dissolved organic matter from the forest floor to see whether it was simply soluble plant material or highly humified matter.  The average annual output from the forest floor in the form of dissolved organic matter was 18, 28, and 14% of the input in solid litterfall for C, N, and P, respectively.  In throughfall, about half of the dissolved N and P was organic.  But, in solution percolating from the forest floor, 94% of the N and 64% of the P was organic.  Leaching from the forest floor was not a source of inorganic N and P for the mineral soil.  Instead, the forest floor was a sink for the removal of these inorganic nutrients delivered in throughfall.  Microbial immobilization was the most likely explanation for much of the inorganic nutrient removal.  In contrast, the forest floor was an abundant contributor of N and P to the mineral soil in the form of dissolved, and possibly particulate, organic matter.  Much of the dissolved organic matter entering the A horizon originated from the upper (Oa and Oe horizon) forest floor, but it was modified in several respects compared to the original soluble material.  The solution percolating from the forest floor over most of the year was much richer in nitrogen, contained a much larger proportion of hydrophilic acids, and contained a much smaller proportion of carbohydrate-rich hydrophilic neutrals, than did the original water-extractable material in autumn litter.  However, the fresh autumn litter did contain a similar proportion of soluble hydrophobic acids that resembled dissolved humic substances in several respects.  Most of the flux of nitrogen from the forest floor to the A horizon was carried by humic substances and highly colored hydrophilic acids.

AB Despite widespread interest in the impact of herbivores on plants, very few studies have addressed the morphological mechanisms by which plants compensate for losses due to herbivore attack, and fewer still have examined compensation in long-lived, herbaceous species. I conducted a 3-yr experimental study of dwarf fireweed's (Epilobium latifolium) responses to real and simulated attack by a momphid caterpillar. I found that the type and extent of plant responses change with morphological and temporal scale. For instance, damaged shoots showed effective compensation, producing between 89 and 583% more branch tissue than undamaged shoots. However, clumps of shoots are joined by perennial rhizomes; a single year of herbivore damage to a clump's shoots reduced net growth by > 75% over a 3-yr period. Clump form also changed following attack; in the year after damage shoot number was reduced by 51%, while mean shoot size either increased or was unaffected. Further complicating the caterpillar's impact on its host was its inhibition of mammalian herbivory:  simulated caterpillar damage reduced the probability of mammalian attack from 20 to 6%. These complicated and very different changes following herbivory illustrate the need to study compensation mechanistically and in the context of a plant's biotic environment in order to understand its importance and consequences.

AB The hypothesis that species and communities occupying vegetationally similar environments on different continents should be similar in ecology has become widely accepted, although quantitative support for this hypothesis is meagre. As an indirect assessment of the likelihood of ecological and evolutionary convergence, I quantified features of community structure and of breeding biology, behavior, and life history of bird species occupying several sites in semi-arid shrub deserts in the Great Basin of North America and the interior of Australia. Study sites on both continents were statistically indistinguishable in most quantitative measures of vegetation structure. Breeding-bird assemblages contained the same number of species per unit area, but densities of individuals in Australia averaged half those in North America. A cluster analysis based on a multivariate similarity matrix derived from 14 ecological and life-history characteristics of the species revealed little close matching of Australian species with a North American counterpart, although two such pairings suggest possible ecological convergence. The frequencies of most ecological/life-history traits among species breeding on local plots differed substantially between continents. The Australian species were characterized by longer breeding periods with more breeding attempts, greater social aggregation during breeding and feeding activities, greater use of domed nests, and sedentariness or nomadism rather than seasonal migration. The avifaunas did not differ in mean clutch sizes, the incidence of polygyny, nesting height, territory size, or general dietary patterns.
   Despite the close matching of vegetation structure on the two continents, differences between the species and communities are more striking than the similarities. These differences may be related to climatic differences between the areas. Although long-term mean precipitation in the Australian and North American shrub-desert regions does not differ, the monthly and yearly variance in Australia is substantially greater. Droughts may be prolonged and widespread, and this factor, together with soil-nutrient limitations, may result in generally lower and more erratic primary and secondary production in the Australian deserts. Close convergence may be lacking because, despite the similarities in habitat structure, the climates and resource levels of Australian and North American shrub deserts differ in fundamental ways, and the avifaunas are of differing phylogenetic derivation.
   These comparisons emphasize that (1) bird communities are frequently open, so understanding the composition and dynamics of local assemblages requires a broad-scale perspective, and (2) generalizations or explanations developed for one region of the world may not apply in other regions, even if the habitats are similar.

AB In this study laboratory experiments were conducted to test predictions of capture performance based on an understanding of the hydrodynamics of contrasting feeding modes (ram and suction feeding) and on an observed ecomorphological pattern among marine members of the temperate fish family Cottidae. Small-mouthed species that feed predominately on grasping prey (e.g., crabs, isopods, gastropods) were predicted to have low capture success on an elusive prey (shrimp) and to use kinematics more consistent with suction-feeding mechanisms; large-mouthed species that feed predominately on elusive prey (e.g., fishes, shrimp) were predicted to have high capture success in attacks on shrimp and to use ram-feeding kinematics. Laboratory experiments in which predators were videotaped in attacks on either hippolytid shrimp or cancrid crabs tested both the attack success and kinematic predictions.
   Small-mouthed cottid species had significantly lower attack success on shrimp (20-41% vs. 45-56%) than did large-mouthed cottids. Both groups had similar high success rates in attacks on crabs on a sand surface: 93-100% for small-mouthed species and 85-95% for large-mouthed species. Most small-mouthed cottids used attack kinematics more typical of suction feeding (e.g., shorter predator-prey distances and slower attack velocities) than did ram feeders. One small-mouthed species, Jordania zonope, used attack kinematics similar to those used by large-mouthed cottids in attacks on shrimp, and had higher capture success than other small-mouthed species, but had significantly lower capture success than large-mouthed species. All predators showed some ability to modify their attack kinematics when attacking prey with different escape tactics, but cottids showed little intraspecific variation in attack kinematics, in contrast to several recent studies of the strike mechanics of lower vertebrates.
   These results emphasize the importance of both mouth morphology and attack kinematics in determining interspecific differences in capture success and, perhaps, diet. The success of the simple predictions presented here provides hope that general predictions of foraging ecology may be derived from morphological patterns when the prey are treated not by their taxonomic affinities but by the functional demands they make on their predators.

AB A sagebrush steppe community in northwestern Colorado was disturbed in 1984 and subjected to annual applications of nitrogen and phosphorus, and successional responses were studied over a 5-yr period. Phosphorus was not found to be significant but nitrogen did significantly affect succession for all years except the first. Three seral groups developed on the non-fertilized plots, the first two dominated by annuals and lasting 3 yr, the third transitional and dominated by perennials. The addition of N altered this successional pattern by allowing annuals to remain as site dominants through the 5th yr. Results of this study suggest that dominance of a site by annuals in early stages of secondary succession is related to high nutrient availability.

AB We determined sex ratio, initial egg complement, and size of adult Aphytis melinus, an ectoparasitoid of California red scale, Aonidiella aurantii. Host scales were reared on leaves of four citrus cultivars previously shown to differ in suitability for scale growth and survival. Wasps from scales reared on leaves of lemon (Citrus limon) produced nearly twice the proportion of female progeny as did wasps from scales reared on leaves of grapefruit (Citrus paradisi), orange (Citrus sinensis), or mandarin (Citrus unshiu). Moreover, female wasps from lemon-reared scales had highest initial egg complement, followed by wasps reared from grapefruit, mandarin, and orange. The quality of scales for the production of fecund, female wasp progeny also varied seasonally over all cultivars pooled. Scales reached largest size when reared in the cooler autumn temperatures and were more than twice as suitable for the production of fecund, female A. melinus as scales reared in early summer or midsummer. Results suggest that the mechanisms allowing persistence of the interaction between California red scale and A. melinus may vary among different citrus cultivars.

AB Risk-sensitive foraging decisions (i.e., those based on both reward mean and variance) have often been observed in laboratory contexts, but there are few observations of risk-sensitive foraging in the wild.  Indeed, wild foragers need not show risk sensitivity, since they can adopt alternative tactics for minimizing their probabilities of energy shortfall.  I tested for risk-sensitive foraging in a natural context in coastal southwest British Columbia, Canada.  Seablush (Plectritis congesta) and dwarf huckleberry (Vaccinium caespitosum) are co-occurring plants that offer foraging bumble bees equivalent expected rates of net energy intake, but that differ in variability.  This equalization of mean profitabilities of floral rewards results from the actions of nectar-collecting foragers.  Risk-sensitive diet choice can therefore be based solely on the variances of the foraging alternatives.  I manipulated the energy requirements of bumble bee colonies (Bombus melanopygus, B. mixtus, B. sitkensis) by draining or enhancing their honey pots.  I then censused foragers from these colonies on the two flower species.  If bees were risk sensitive in their diet choice, they should have increased their relative use of the more variable flower type (dwarf huckleberry) when their colonies were nectar depleted compared to when their colonies were nectar enhanced.  This was indeed the case.  Wild-foraging bumble bees thus appear to be sensitive to both the mean and the variance of the energy rewards offered by alternative flower species, and this sensitivity is affected by colony energy requirements.  These results suggest that wild foragers may change their risk sensitivity.

AB Because hummingbirds are extremely sensitive to energy stress, yet often face conditions when energy intake is reduced or energy expenditures must be increased, they should have flexible energy budgets.  I experimentally measured the ability of two syntopic tropical hummingbird species to manage daytime energy budgets under conditions simulating natural foraging constraint, defined here as low nectar secretion rate, low flower density, or both.  I tested a territorial species, Amazilia saucerottei, and a traplining species, Chlorostibon canivetii, individually in a large flight cage at two rates of food delivery (HIGH = ad libitum, LOW = 64% of ad libitum) and two perch-to-feeder distances (NEAR = 4 m, FAR = 20 m).  Both species increased flight time when distance was increased (FAR > NEAR by 44%) and when rate of food delivery was reduced (LOW > HIGH by 23%).  However, birds on the HIGH food delivery rate did not increase food intake to compensate for increased flight expenditures to the FAR feeder.  Birds on LOW food maintained total rates of energy expenditure that were less than birds on HIGH food, and LOW food birds experienced no effect of feeder distance on expenditure.  These results appear to be due primarily to short-term reductions in perching metabolic rates (PMRs) by birds on LOW food or with the FAR feeder.  Reduced daytime PMRs helped to mitigate the potentially negative impacts of foraging constraint:  rates of mass loss of the LOW food birds were an estimated 48% less than if birds had maintained normal PMRs.  Reduced PMRs also enabled birds visiting the HIGH FAR feeder to maintain rates of mass gain equal to unconstrained birds (HIGH NEAR feeder).  Relative differences between species in energy management reflected their foraging modes.  The low-reward trapliner paid the greatest energy costs at LOW food, regardless of distance, due to its overall tendency for high flight time.  In contrast, the territorialist did poorly in the HIGH FAR treatment, due to flight expenditures associated with defending a rich but dispersed resource.  Although individual birds exhibited considerable flexibility in energy management, the foraging mode represented by each species appeared to be energetically specialized for particular levels of food availability and dispersion.

AB In a tropical cloud forest at Monteverde, Costa Rica, three understory shrub species overlap greatly in flowering seasons and share hummingbird pollinators (Lampornis calolaema). We conducted two field experiments to determine if a plant's pollination and subsequent reproductive output reflect local densities of conspecific and heterospecific flowers. We controlled floral composition in the neighborhoods surrounding 12 focal plants of self-compatible Besleria triflora (Gesneriaceae) and of self-incompatible Palicourea lasiorrachis (Rubiaceae), producing prescribed mixtures of flowers of the focal plants' conspecifics and of Cephaelis elata (Rubiaceae). Each experiment subjected each focal plant to four different treatments: a floral neighborhood of 10 conspecific flowers and 10 of Cephaelis within a radius of 20 m (Treatment A); 90:10 (B); 10:90 (C); and 50:50 (D). Focal plants themselves always had 10 open flowers. We assigned the sequence of treatments to each focal plant in a Latin square crossover design using three balanced blocks of four plants each. Dependent variables were: frequency of hummingbird probes per flower; pollen tubes in styles; and seed output per flower. From standard models of competition for pollination, we predicted that pollination levels and seed production would be ranked among treatments: B(90:10) > D(50:50) > A(10:10) > C(10:90).
   These overall predictions were supported for both Palicourea and Besleria, based on tests for directionality showing that the rank order among adjusted treatment means did not differ from the order predicted. Separate a priori treatment contrasts indicated that in both species increasing flower density above base levels (Treatment A, 10:10) by adding conspecific flowers alone (B, 90:10) or along with Cephaelis (D, 50:50) increased the rate at which hummingbirds visited focal plants' flowers. In Palicourea, both the number of pollen tubes in styles and seed output per flower increased in the same fashion. In Besleria, the only effect was increased pollination (but not seed output) from A (10:10) to B (90:10). In contrast, enriching the basic neighborhood (A, 10:10) with Cephaelis flowers (C, 10:90) did not alter frequencies of hummingbird probes to either species of focal plant. Heterospecific enrichment did, however, decrease both pollination levels and seed output in Palicourea, and seed output in Besleria. In general, altering the floral neighborhood affected Palicourea more strongly than Besleria. Apparently the intensity of density dependence, at least in terms of female reproductive success, varies among plant species sharing pollinators. Seed outputs in self-incompatible plants such as Palicourea may closely reflect flower densities of neighbors, but interspecific effects on fertilization in self-compatible plants such as Besleria may be density vague.

AB We examined environmental effects on the correlation between age and size at metamorphosis in spadefoot toad tadpoles (Scaphiopus multiplicatus). These tadpoles occur in ponds of variable duration as two environmentally induced, trophic morphs: a large, rapidly developing carnivore morph and a smaller, more slowly developing omnivore morph. Drawing on data from both natural ponds and artificial pools we examined for both morphs the environmental determinants of, and the intercorrelations among, three life history parameters: age at metamorphosis, size at metamorphosis, and survivorship (both pre- and postmetamorphic). Censuses of four natural ponds revealed that age and size at metamorphosis for both morphs were inversely related, in contrast to many other amphibians and insects with complex life cycles. In artificial pools in which we simultaneously varied two diet components and pond duration, age and size at metamorphosis were negatively correlated in high food treatments and positively correlated in low food, long pond duration treatments. Ephemeral larval habitats should favor rapid differentiation; achieving large body size depends upon the quality and quantity of available food and the time available to develop. A negative relationship between age and size at metamorphosis may occur often in S. multiplicatus since this species is exposed to a rapidly diminishing food resource (anostracans). We predict that other organisms with complex life cycles faced with these conditions would possess an inverse relationship between size and age at metamorphosis.

AB The influence of predaceous fish in affecting components of fitness of immature and adult macroinvertebrates was examined using a predator enclosure/exclosure experiment in a southern Ontario stream. The stonefly Paragnetina media is a semivoltine species with a midsummer emergence period. After exposure of P. media to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) between May and August (repeated twice, 1987 and 1989), we observed significant reductions in nymphal density, size (head width), and condition (mass/head width). Reductions in density were attributable to nymphal emigration and predation. Selective predation on larger stoneflies (direct effects), together with changes in nymphal feeding rate, activity, and distribution (indirect effects), reduced size and condition of stoneflies exposed to trout. After August-to-October (I 986 and 1989) and January-to-April (1988) exposures, we observed no effect of trout on these parameters.
   Adult stoneflies (P. media and Alloperla mediana) cannot feed, and consequently any energy that they channel into reproductive efforts must be derived from the aquatic stage. Thus, we postulated that the impact of trout on immature P. media and A. mediana might manifest itself negatively on stonefly adults. Although size and emergence pattern of adult P. media and A. mediana did not differ between enclosure/exclosure sections of stream, in the presence of trout both species suffered significant reductions in condition, fecundity, and total number to emerge. These findings demonstrate that direct and indirect effects of a predator can cascade from immature to adult prey and from aquatic to terrestrial eco-systems.

AB We document variation in the degree of arboreality among four populations of the western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis), and investigate how this variation relates to locomotor performance capability in an arboreal context (e.g., artificial branches). We raced lizards on four different rod diameters, measured maximum sprint speed, and also scored agility on the rods. Lizards from more terrestrial populations ran faster on thick rods, but slower on thin rods than did lizards from more arboreal populations. The terrestrial lizards experienced a greater difference in sprint speed than did the more arboreal lizards over the range of rod sizes we used. Arboreal lizards were more adept at running on all surfaces in that they stumbled and fell less often, particularly from the thinnest rods. Thus, specialization for maximizing sprinting performance on arboreal surfaces of a particular diameter entails a performance trade-off that is reflected in both speed and "sure-footedness." We investigated whether the population differences in arboreal sprinting are correlated with the significant differences in hind-limb span found among populations. We found that lizards with relatively longer limbs sprinted faster. By using juveniles reared in a common laboratory environment, we demonstrated that these among-population differences in arboreal sprint performance are probably genetically based.

AB The spatial pattern of and the transition rates between forest ecological states were inferred for almost-equal-to 260000 pixel-sized (3600 m2) landscape units using satellite remote sensing.  Transition rates were estimated from 1973 to 1983 Landsat images of the study area, classified into ecological states associated with forest succession.  The effects of classification error on transition rate estimates were modeled and error adjustments made.
   Classification of the 1973 and 1983 Landsat images of the 900 km2 study region required a relatively small set of ground-observed and photo-interpreted plots in 1983, with a total area of just 1.62 km2.  An innovative technique for correcting multiyear Landsat images for between-image differences in atmospheric effects and sensor calibration, permitted classification of the 1973 Landsat image using 1983 ground observations.  Given current Landsat data, and ground observations in one year, this technique would permit monitoring of forest succession and dynamics for nearly a 20-yr period.
   Results of applying these techniques to a forest ecosystem showed that during the 10-yr observation period it was patchy and dynamic.  For both a wilderness and a nonwilderness area in the study region, sizeable values of transition rates were observed and over half of the landscape units were observed to change state; however, a Markov analysis, using the observed transition probabilities, suggests that at the regional level neither the wilderness nor the nonwilderness areal proportions of ecological states are undergoing rapid change.

AB The spatial distribution of diaspores in seed banks can be significantly affected by physical processes that act on diaspores after they reach the soil surface. We examined how diaspore morphology and soil particle size affect diaspore incorporation into soil in a disturbed alpine ecosystem on the Beartooth Plateau, Montana, USA. Diaspores of alpine species with varying morphology were sown over soils of five different particle sizes and later collected from three depths. Regardless of diaspore morphology, the total number of diaspores trapped increased with increasing particle size until a threshold soil particle size was reached above which no more diaspores were trapped. At small particle sizes (0.5-1.0 and 1.0-2.0 mm) small diaspores and diaspores with adhesive seed coats were trapped, but most large diaspores moved horizontally across the surface and were not trapped. The majority of those diaspores trapped were at the 0-1 cm depth at small particle sizes. At large particle sizes (2.0-4.0, 4.0-8.0, and 8.0-16.0 mm) high numbers of large diaspores were trapped, and more diaspores moved vertically through the soil column. In small particle size soils small diaspores reached greater depths than large diaspores. Diaspores with adhesive seed coats responded more like large diaspores in terms of vertical movement. Diaspore length and eccentricity (length/width) were highly correlated with entrapment at small particle sizes and appeared to have the greatest effect on horizontal movement. Mass and width were significantly correlated with numbers of diaspores trapped in large particle sizes and were influencing vertical movement.
   Models based on the Weibull probability distribution were used to describe diaspore "survival" on the soil surface and to describe vertical movement in the soil column.
   This study indicates that on exposed soils in windy environments diaspore morphology and soil particle size greatly affect the spatial distribution of diaspores in seed banks. For diaspores of a given species, the optimal soil type traps a high number of diaspores but precludes significant downward movement.

AB Methods are available in the literature for the measurement of instantaneous growth rates in field samples of photosynthetic microbes and procaryotic saprotrophic microbes, but there has been no such method for eucaryotic saprotrophic microbes (members of the kingdom Fungi). We have devised a technique for estimating instantaneous growth rates for ergosterol-containing fungi in field material, and preliminarily applied the technique to estimation of fungal productivities and throughputs in two types of standing-dead grass (one saltwater, one freshwater), obtaining plausible values (e.g., conversion efficiencies, total fungal production divided-by leaf mass loss, were calculated to be 36-64%). This method is based on measuring rates of radiolabeled acetate incorporation into ergosterol. We examined several potential problem areas for use of radiolabeled precursors in measurement of microbial molecular syntheses, and its extrapolation to microbial productivity. Key findings were: (a) 5 mmol/L added acetate (required for maximization of detection of rates) had positive or neutral impact on 48-h fungal growth, and no shift-up (sudden upward change in rate) or lag in incorporation of acetate into ergosterol occurred between 0.25 and 1.25 h of incubation of naturally decaying leaf (Spartina alterniflora) samples with 5 mmol/L acetate; (b) bacterial assemblages on leaves did not contribute radioactivity to the ergosterol fraction after incubation with radioacetate (as opposed to > 30 Bq per centimetre length of leaf containing fungal mycelium); (c) the average empirical factor for conversion from nanomoles C-14-acetate incorporated to micrograms organic fungal mass produced was 8.2-mu-g/nmol (coefficient of variation, 27%). We tentatively conclude that the acetate-to-ergosterol method is tenable for measurement of natural fungal productivity.

AB Water-filled treeholes provide an experimental setting for examining processes within an ecosystem, and influences of external factors on those processes. Using a limnological, experimental approach involving both natural tree holes and laboratory microcosms of the tree hole ecosystem, we identified and studied interacting, biotic processes, including dynamics of bacterial populations and variation in concentration of inorganic nutrients in tree hole water, and density-dependent competition for food among larvae of the mosquito Aedes triseriatus. We characterized the influence of external factors (inputs of leaf detritus and stemflow) on those processes. Analyses of water samples over time showed that tree hole water was rich and dynamic in nutrients (nitrite, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, and sulfate); ammonium was the dominant form of inorganic nitrogen. Variation in nutrient concentrations in microcosms depended upon exogenous inputs (leaf detritus and stemflow water), dilution of nutrients by stemflow, nutrient cycling processes (nitrification, denitrification, and sulfate reduction), and ammonium excretion by mosquito larvae. The densities of bacteria in tree hole water, obtained using direct counts of DAPI-fluorochrome stained samples and epifluorescence microscopy, ranged from 2.0 x 10(6) to 6.0 x 10(7) cells/mL, and in microcosms from 4.6 x 10(5) to 2.6 x 10(8) cells/mL. Experimentation mentation involving microcosms revealed that bacterial abundance was reduced by mosquito feeding and stemflow flushing. Further experiments showed that stemflow flushing increased mosquito productivity from microcosms several-fold and released mosquitoes from density-dependent competition. This effect was likely related to nutrient input and the simultaneous removal of toxic metabolites owing to inputs of stemflow water. We conclude that disturbance by a physical factor, stemflow, has a major influence on the interactions of nutrient dynamics, bacterial populations, and mosquito productivity in temperate tree-hole ecosystems.

AB Suspended sediments (clay and silt particles) differentially inhibit cladoceran populations, but not rotifer populations, and can change the outcome of competition between rotifers and cladocerans in favor of rotifers (Kirk and Gilbert 1990). This paper provides a mechanistic explanation for the population and community effects of suspended clay. Feeding experiments with radioactively labeled phytoplankton cells (Cryptomonas) showed that the presence of suspended clay (< 2-mu-m particle size) significantly decreased the phytoplankton ingestion rates of five cladoceran species (Ceriodaphnia dubia, Daphnia ambigua, D. galeata mendotae, D. magna, and D. pulex) by 13-83% but not those of three rotifer species (Keratella cochlearis, K. crassa, and Synchaeta pectinata). When radioactively labeled phytoplankton cells and clay particles were offered simultaneously, cladocerans were less selective for phytoplankton over clay than were rotifers. Thus, cladocerans ingested more suspended clay particles than did rotifers, and this caused the reductions in phytoplankton ingestion rates. Smaller cladocerans were less selective for phytoplankton over clay than were larger cladocerans, and their phytoplankton ingestion rates were thus reduced more by clay. Rotifers fed more selectively than either large or small cladocerans, were able to avoid ingesting clay particles, and therefore were not inhibited by suspended clay. Thus, differences in the feeding modes and selectivities of rotifers and cladocerans form the mechanistic basis for the change in competitive outcome in favor of rotifers observed in the presence of suspended clay. This mechanism may form the basis for changes in the relative abundance of rotifers and cladocerans in turbid lakes and reservoirs.

AB In order to quantify the response of birds to experimental manipulations of seed availability and densities of granivorous rodents and ants, we counted granivorous birds and measured diurnal and nocturnal seed removal on 24 plots during months in the Chihuahuan Desert.  Removal of single, widely spaced millet seeds provided a reliable measure of bird and rodent foraging activity.
   Avian foraging activity increased in response to supplemental seeds, but decreased in response to long-term removal of all rodents and all ants.  Although birds potentially compete for seeds with rodents and ants, these results suggest that, in the long term, indirect facilitation dominates the interactions among all three taxa.  The positive effect of the other granivores on birds may be mediated through changes in habitat structure (e.g., reduction in the density of annual plants).  The increase of avian foraging in response to seed addition and the high spatial and temporal variance in the patterns of seed removal by birds indicate that in desert habitats granivorous birds use their mobility to find and exploit high concentrations of seeds.  Thus, birds may reduce the spatial variation in seed abundance and reduce the densities of seeds available to other granivores.  The foraging behaviour of birds and rodents revealed by these experiments clarifies the response of granivores to experimental manipulations reported earlier, such as the lack of biomass compensation by rodents in response to seed addition.

AB Data on survival in and emergence from soil seed banks are scarce for natural plant populations.  In this paper I present a new experimental method for quantifying soil seed bank dynamics in the field and data derived from this method describing the age structure of the seed bank for the winter annual Collinsia verna.  The roles of spatial and temporal variation in seed bank formation were investigated using a replicated design arrayed along three transects in the study site.  Emergence from and persistence in the seed bank were monitored for 3 yr using experimental seed banks containing seeds of the same age arrayed along each of the three transects.  In addition, replicate estimates of survivorship and fecundity of naturally emerging plants were monitored in quadrats arrayed along each of the three transects.  The conditional probability of persisting in the seed bank for 1 yr ranged from 14 to 45% and differed significantly among the transects.  Significant differences in the probabilities of emerging (or persisting) produced seed banks of varying age structure among the transects and years.  A life table analysis of the vegetative plants indicated significant differences between years in their survivorship curves.  In addition, seedlings derived from seeds 1 yr old or older germinated significantly later than the general seed population.  Age-structured seed banks are expected to alter the population dynamics and demographic projections of plant populations.

AB This study illustrates the physiological and biochemical responses to temperature of maternal phenotypes of plants of Echinochloa crus-galli that result in different progeny phenotypes. Our results provide a physiological scenario that accounts for strong, nongenetic, maternal effects. At low temperature, the photosynthetic rates of flag,leaves were reduced, while concentrations of sugars and starch were increased. These physiological modifications suggest reduced phloem translocation to the reproductive structures in plants grown under cold conditions. At high temperature, high respiration rates of inflorescences were observed during seed development. To offset the effect of ear (fruit) respiration, mother-plants grown under warm conditions would have to translocate some 30% more carbohydrates than at low temperature. Our study therefore suggests that environmentally induced modifications in simple physiological traits can account for an important reduction in resources available to reproduction. Changes in leaf starch, reducing sugars, and protein contents induced by temperature persist through the life of a second generation of plants. Biochemical modifications due to maternal effects may influence overall plant performance. For example, the higher protein concentration of seedlings grown from cold-matured seeds may enhance their cold tolerance.

AB Few experimental studies of mating behavior have examined mating behavior shifts in response to ecological factors (e.g., predators, starvation). We conducted experiments designed to: (1) examine multiple trade-offs between predator avoidance, feeding behavior, and copulation duration in a semiaquatic insect (Microvelia austrina); and (2) address the influence of altered copulation duration on male reproductive success. To examine multiple trade-offs, we used a 2 x 2 factorial design where we measured the amount of time that mating microveliids remained in tandem, for starved and fed microveliids in the presence and absence of predaceous water striders (Gerris remigis). We also looked at the effects of presence vs. absence of green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) on microveliid tandem duration. To address the impact of premature pair separation on male mating success, we separated paired microveliids in field populations and measured the time required for each sex to find new mates. To examine the effects of local sex ratio on remating times of males and females, we quantified the sex ratio of field populations via periodic censuses and correlated local sex ratio with remating times. Finally, to address oviposition rates while pairs are in tandem, we measured female oviposition patterns relative to tandem duration for poorly fed and well-fed females.
   Both starvation and gerrid presence significantly reduced tandem duration. As a result of male-biased sex ratios, males that prematurely separated from females often faced long search times before securing a new mate. Females oviposited at a constant rate while in tandem. A simple computer simulation incorporating the above observations suggests that reductions in tandem duration can decrease fertilization rates.

AB We experimentally studied the effects of avian predation on grasshopper abundance in western North Dakota during the summers of 1988 and 1989. Grasshopper densities in 15 x 15 m plots from which birds were excluded (NO BIRDS) were compared with similar-sized plots where birds were allowed to forage (BIRDS). Plots were established in early June at 16 sites (8 per year), and grasshopper densities were estimated from hoop counts in NO BIRDS and BIRDS plots at 2-wk intervals until the end of July. There were significantly more grasshoppers in NO BIRDS plots than in BIRDS plots in 1989 (P < .0001), but not in 1988 (P = .137). The difference between treatments in 1989 was first detected 6 wk after the exclosures were erected. Between years there were no differences in initial grasshopper abundance in all treatments (P > .388). After the final hoop count each year, sweep-net sampling was also used to estimate grasshopper densities. By this method, average grasshopper density in late July was 26% and 37% lower in BIRDS plots than in NO BIRDS plots in 1988 and 1989, respectively. Average length, total biomass of grasshoppers, species richness, and species diversity, however, did not differ between the treatments. In 1988, 2 of 15 grasshopper species were significantly more abundant in the NO BIRDS plots. There was no difference between the treatments among 16 species identified in the 1989 samples, but the power of our tests to detect differences for individual species was low. Our results support the hypothesis that avian predation reduces insect populations at low and moderate densities.

AB We conducted a series of single-factor and factorial experiments in two north-temperate lakes (Peter and Paul lakes, Gogebic County, Michigan, USA) to study regulation of heterotrophic microbial communities.  In single-factor experiments large Daphnia were added to enclosures, and these were compared to enclosures without Daphnia.  These treatments contrast the major food-web configurations that occur in these lakes as a consequence of cascading trophic interactions.  Bacterial abundance and the incorporation of methyl [H-3]-thymidine into DNA by bacteria were similar in treatments with and without Daphnia.  Ciliates were significantly reduced while heterotrophic flagellates were only marginally reduced by Daphnia additions in the Peter Lake experiments.  Protozoans were not affected by Daphnia additions in the Paul Lake experiment.  Factorial experiments compared the relative significance of large daphnids and nutrients as regulators of bacteria and protozoa.  Treatments included controls, Daphnia additions, nutrient (N plus P) additions, and a combined Daphnia-nutrient treatment.  Bacteria responded to nutrient additions but not to Daphnia.  Protozoa, on the other hand, were strongly affected by Daphnia and to a lesser extent by nutrients.  These experiments suggest that the trophic cascade is truncated at the level of protozoans.  Protozoa appear to be partially regulated by predators, whereas bacteria show no response to changes in either Daphnia or protozoa.

AB A model community, which consists of multiple trophic levels (several species of prey, and several predator species including omnivores) is considered from the viewpoint of coevolutionary stability. Some properties of community digraphs are studied and resource utilization patterns of predators are given as necessary conditions for a coevolutionarily stable community (CSC). If a member of a predator species can simultaneously search for multiple prey species, a set of the prey species is interpreted as a single "prey trophic species." (1) For any subgraph of a CSC food web, the number of links between predator and prey trophic species is less than the sum of the number of predator species and the number of true prey species. (2) If any predator member searches for only one prey species, then for any CSC food web, the number of links connecting that predator and its prey is less than the sum of the number of predator species and that of prey species, where a species at an intermediate trophic level is doubly counted as prey and also as predator. (3) The maximum number of links in a CSC digraph is proportional to the number of species in the community. With our model we attempt to explain intervality of a niche overlap graph and lack of a hole in a common enemy graph. Finally, we examined two examples of real communities to confirm validity of our results.

AB Variation in the contribution of different-sized individuals to female and male function was examined for the extremes of a size-structured population of hermaphroditic Sabatia angularis (Gentianaceae).  Local populations of S. angularis at Miller Dunes, Indiana consisted of 10-15% large plants (> 25 flowers) and approximately 50% small plants (< 7 flowers).  Components of female function studied were (1) pollen grain deposition on stigmas, (2) probability of fruit set, (3) seed production per fruit, (4) average seed mass per fruit, and (5) seed dispersal distributions.  Components of male function examined were (1) pollen production on a per flower basis, (2) pollen removal rates, and (3) pollinator observations and fluorescent dye experiments to infer pollen movement.
   Large plants contributed disproportionately through female and male function to the production of offspring compared to small plants.  In one of the two years examined, the proportion of flowers developing into fruits was significantly greater in large plants than small plants.  Seed production per fruit was overall twofold greater for fruits of large plants than small plants.  Plant size had no effect on mean seed mass per fruit or the distance of primary and secondary seed dispersal.  Flowers of large plants produced significantly more pollen per flower and had significantly more pollen grains deposited on their stigmas than flowers of small plants.  However, there was no difference in the proportion of pollen removed from flowers of small and large plants, although the absolute number of pollen grains removed was greater for large plants.  Large plants appeared to have the potential for more geitonogamous pollinations than small plants.

AB The large 1950s fires that burned > 5500 km2 of land across a south-to-north climatic gradient in northern Quebec provide an opportunity to evaluate the role of fire in forest-tundra development on a demographic basis.  The tree population density before and almost-equal-to 30 yr after fire was estimated by censusing trees in plots of 400 m2 located in upland and lowland within four representative ecoregions of northern Quebec.  The analysis of tree recruitment before and after fire, in 410 randomly selected sites along a transect crossing the upper boreal forest and forest-tundra zones, indicated that wildfires induced substantial depletion of tree populations.  Taken as a whole, fires have significantly reduced the density of black spruce populations in forest-tundra uplands, but not in the lowlands.  A reduction in tree population density of greater-than-or-equal-to 75% was observed in 22% of upper boreal forest sites, and 45% and 93% of sites located in the forest and shrub subzones, respectively, of the forest-tundra zone.  Complete exclusion of tree populations by fire was observed in 43% of upland sites in the northern part of the transect, while complete removal was a rare event in the southern part.  Sustained reduction of tree population density after several destructive fires appears as one of the main deforestation processes in the subarctic zone.  This leads to the patchy distribution of forest stands and scattered tree populations typical of the forest-tundra biome.  Comparisons with paleoecological data suggest that the impact of the 1950s fires contributed to the expansion of the forest tundra into the upper boreal forest.  The ecological impact of these fires was probably similar to those fires responsible for development of the forest tundra during the Holocene.  It is suggested that the fire-climate interaction should be considered in order to predict the ecological impact of warming climate on high-latitude forest ecosystems.

AB Transport of resources among connected ramets can increase the growth of clonal plants when ramets are located in microsites with contrasting light, water, or total soil nutrient availability.  To test whether this is also true for soil nitrogen availability alone, two greenhouse experiments were conducted using the stoloniferous herb Fragaria chiloensis (beach strawberry).  First, pairs of ramets were prepared in which the two ramets were connected by a stolon but rooted in separate pots.  Ramets in a pair were:  (1) severed from each other and given contrasting levels of soil nitrogen (high vs. low); (2) left connected and given contrasting levels of soil nitrogen; or (3) left connected and given a uniform level of soil nitrogen (both high or both low).  Second, single ramets were given the high, the low, or one of three intermediate levels of soil nitrogen.  Maintaining the vascular connection between ramets given contrasting levels of soil nitrogen resulted in a greater production of new stolons and new ramets by the ramet given the low nitrogen level, and in slightly greater leaf growth of the ramet given the low nitrogen level if it was also younger than the connected ramet.  However, a ramet given high soil nitrogen grew much more than a ramet given low soil nitrogen, even when connected.  Maintaining the vascular connection between ramets given a uniform level of soil nitrogen had no significant effect on growth.  Single ramets given a higher soil nitrogen level had greater total and component masses, more stolons and new ramets, higher nitrogen concentrations, higher specific leaf area, and a higher proportional mass of leaves and of stolons and new ramets.  Experiments suggested that:  (1) transport of nitrogen among ramets can increase growth in F. chiloensis, but to a limited extent; (2) transport of nitrogen through a stolon may be either acropetal or basipetal but tends to promote the growth of younger ramets; (3) higher soil nitrogen availability alters plant architecture by increasing allocation to leaves and to new stolons and ramets; and (4) physiological integration among ramets modifies clonal architecture because nitrogen acquired by roots promotes growth of both a rooted ramet and its new ramets, whereas nitrogen acquired from another ramet promotes the growth of new ramets almost exclusively.

AB During summer 1986, we assessed the effect of individual variation in per flower nectar production rate on one component of plant reproductive success (percent fruit set) mediated through differential pollinator attractiveness.  Thirty-two individual mountain laurels, Kalmia latifolia, were monitored for average 24-h nectar production in individual flowers, average per flower pollinator visitation rate, average floral density, and percent fruit set.  Significant positive correlations occurred between (1) average 24-h nectar production by individual flowers and average visitation rate per flower, and (2) average visitation rate per flower and percent fruit set.  Pollinators appeared to be differentially attracted to individual shrubs that produce larger quantities of nectar per flower, and the increased visitation rate promoted a higher percentage fruit set because K. latifolia is pollination limited.  However, there was no correlation between an individual shrub's 24-h nectar production in 1986 and that same individual's 24-h nectar production in 1985.  Thus, while pollinator behavior appears to influence this component of plant reproductive success in Kalmia, any selective advantage to individuals may vary between flowering seasons.

AB Plants of Plantago major were grown for two generations in different environments. Seed germination of the second generation was examined for the effects of maternal environments, as well as subsequent plant growth and reproduction in the presence of inter- and intraspecific competitors. Maternal treatments were (1) plants that had received nutrient pulses in both the first and second generations (PP plants), (2) plants that had received a nutrient pulse only in the first generation (PC plants), (3) plants that had received a nutrient pulse only in the second generation (CP plants), and (4) plants that did not receive a nutrient pulse in either generation (CC plants). Under favorable conditions (without interaction with a leaf canopy and root system of grasses), seeds of CC plants generally germinated earlier and had a higher final germination percentage. In contrast, under a Poa canopy, seeds of PP plants germinated earlier and had a higher final germination percentage. For adult plants, there were significant interactions between maternal environment and neighbor density. The effects of maternal environments on leaf area generally were evident before flowering but disappeared after flowering. The greatest difference in leaf area occurred between CC and PP plants, and these were often different from CP and PC plants. There was a significant three-way interaction among the type of competition, maternal treatment, and neighbor density for biomass characters. In intraspecific competition with one neighbor, the spike biomass was highest in PP plants followed by CP plants, PC plants, and CC plants, with the last significantly lower than the first two. In general, the juvenile maternal effect did not necessarily result in an adult reproductive advantage. The influence of the maternal environment differed among plant characters.
   These results demonstrate that maternal environmental factors can affect plant phenotypic characters for at least three generations. The expression and the extent of these maternal effects varied with the resource condition experienced by the progeny, the intensity of competitive interactions, and life history stage.

AB Predicting the species density (number of species per unit area) of communities is a major goal of ecology. We present a regression model of species density on a local (0.25 m2) scale for the vegetation of freshwater shorelines in southwestern Quebec, Canada. Two attributes of the vegetation, the amount of aboveground biomass (in grams) and the proportion of the vegetation composed of obligate perennial species, predicted 76% of the variation in species density. The success of the predictor variables suggests that competitive intensity, as reflected in biomass levels, and the time elapsed since the last disturbance event, as reflected in the proportion of the vegetation composed of obligate perennials, are important determinants of local variation in species density. The model was then tested against independent data from shoreline vegetation in southeastern Ontario, Canada. There were no significant differences in the two data sets in their response to the two independent variables in the full model. However, only 42% of the variance in species density was explained in the combined data set.

AB Small herbivorous mammals living in successional patchy environments may be affected by both patch size variations and successional changes. If patch size affects densities of residents then larger patches should have higher densities compared to smaller patches because larger patches often have greater habitat diversity and lesser chances of stochastic events destroying the population. If patch size affects length of time animals spend on patches (persistence rates) then smaller patches should have lower persistence rates compared to larger patches because smaller patches contain fewer resources. Larger animals may be constrained by body size, as well as population size, to reside only on the larger patches because smaller patches do not contain enough resources. If successional changes affect resident animals that are host specific on colonizing plant species, then the effects may be noticeable immediately following field abandonment because plant species replacement rates are most rapid then.
   Four small mammal species were included:  Sigmodon hispidus, Reithrodontomys megalotis, Microtus ochrogaster, and Peromyscus maniculatus. The field was divided into patches that varied in area by two orders of magnitude with patches of each size treatment placed in each section of the field. Patch size effects on densities and persistence rates of the four mammal species were tested with analyses of variance. Plant species were grouped according to seven life history traits so as to include relative percent cover of most plant species. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to identify which variables (patch size, field sections, and percent relative cover) significantly explained variations in small mammal densities.
   Effects of patch size on animal densities and persistence rates varied among animal species. The largest species, Sigmodon hispidus, was never found on the smallest patches, but densities of Reithrodontomys megalotis, Microtus ochrogaster, and Peromyscus maniculatus were often highest on the smallest patches. Animal density variations were often significantly explained by patch size using multiple regression analyses (P less-than-or-equal-to .001). However, lack of consistent trends with respect to the other independent variables included in the equations and variable R2 values suggested that other, unmeasured, variables may have influenced the results. Persistence rates of the three species were often highest on the largest patches. Results suggested that animals visited small patches more often than large patches without staying, and used large patches to create territories. Small and medium patches may have been used as archipelagos of preferred habitat interspersed with less desirable habitat.
   The first stage of old-field succession was completed by the end of the 3rd yr:  perennials replaced annuals as the dominant plant species. Neither patch size nor field sections significantly affected percent cover.

AB Seasonal pools undergo marked diurnal changes in pH, free carbon dioxide, and oxygen levels.  Previous studies showed that Isoetes howellii utilized crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis as a means of assimilating carbon at night when ambient carbon dioxide levels are high.  However, much of the pool flora is not CAM.  We hypothesized that coexistence under extreme carbon-limiting conditions would select for other photosynthetic characteristics in these non-CAM species.  Quantitative carbon uptake measurements were made in the field on the CAM Isoetes howellii and the non-CAM Eleocharis acicularis, Downingia bella, and Plagiobothrys undulatus.  Despite wide phylogenetic separation, these species are structurally convergent in that they all produce an aquatic stage with an isoetid growth form.  They are functionally similar in that none appear to utilize bicarbonate, and all are carbon limited through much of the day, as indicated by a marked midday depression in carbon uptake that lasts through the afternoon.
   All four species were capable of carbon fixation at night, although only in Isoetes howellii was this accompanied by an overnight accumulation of acid.  It was estimated that dark fixation in I. howellii contributed up to 40% of its total carbon gain under submerged conditions, but was < 1% under aerial conditions.  The role of dark fixation in the other three, non-CAM, species is unknown.  Short-term (1 s) steady-state C-14 tracer studies in the laboratory revealed that, under submerged conditions in the light, all species assimilated carbon into the C3 photosynthetic product phosphoglycerate (PGA) and the C4 photosynthetic products of malate, citrate, and aspartate.  The proportion of label fixed into C4 organic acids was greatest in E. acicularis.  The ratio of RuBP carboxylase/PEP carboxylase was broadly similar in all species, ranging from 8.8 to 11.5.
   When the pools dried down and the plants became aerial, photosynthetic rates increased and a midday depression such as occurred under submergence was not observed.  Carbon fixation in the dark became negligible, and the RuBP carboxylase/PEP carboxylase ratio increased.  Seasonal changes in biomass showed I. howellii and E. acicularis dominated the pools early in the season, and the biomass of the other two species increased later when the pools dried.  The latter species, D. bella and P. undulatus, also had higher rates of photosynthesis under aerial conditions.

AB The effects of three herbivores on growth, survivorship, and fruit production of smooth sumac (Rhus glabra) were measured over the 1984-1986 growing seasons.  The herbivores, a specialist chrysomelid beetle (Blepharida rhois), a specialist cerambycid beetle (Oberea ocellata), and whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus), feed on different plant parts and are active during different times of the year.  My goals were to determine (1) the effects on ramets of each herbivore separately and in combination over several years, (2) whether herbivore effects were consistent from year to year, (3) whether the history of attack affects subsequent herbivory, both within and between seasons, (4) whether herbivores interact directly, and/or indirectly, through changes in the host plant, and (5) whether any herbivore(s) emerge as particularly prominent selective agents on the plant, considering both their direct and indirect effects.
   Selective exclosures were used to manipulate herbivory histories of ramets.  All manipulations were done in the field under natural densities of all herbivores.  Herbivory treatments were cumulative over 3 yr, so that by 1986, each treatment comprised a history of 3 yr of absence/presence of browsing and beetle attack.  Differing combinations of attack allowed me to detect how herbivory in one year affected ramet growth in following years.
   The effects of deer, chrysomelids, and cerambycids on sumac differed not only in their magnitude and direction, but also in their effects in combination.  Chrysomelid herbivory (randomly assigned, using natural densities of beetles) over 3 yr was always injurious to sumac ramets.  Damage in 1984 was especially injurious, and was still detectable 2-3 yr later in ramet growth, despite the absence of any subsequent herbivory.  Cumulative effects of chrysomelid damage were also found, i.e., the more years a ramet was exposed to chrysomelid herbivory, the more likely it was to die.
   In contrast to chrysomelid damage, deer browsing was generally associated with increased ramet growth and/or reproduction.  These effects were weaker and had no detectable long-term effects.  The positive effects associated with browsing may reflect selectivity on the part of deer rather than positive effects of browsing, since browsing was not randomly assigned (Strauss 1988a).
   I found nonadditive effects of damage by different herbivores on ramet growth or mortality.  For example, there was no effect of browsing on the magnitude of chrysomelid effects on ramet growth; however, browse effects on ramet growth disappeared on chrysomelid-attacked ramets, but were still apparent on ramets protected from chrysomelid herbivory.
   Many interactions between herbivores were found.  Every pair of herbivore species, despite very different feeding habits, exhibited at least one interaction.  Most interactions resulted from temporally separated herbivory events and were thus mediated by the host plant.  In no cases were interactions symmetrical.
   From 3 yr of observations, chrysomelids were always the most injurious herbivore, deer were never injurious (and were potentially beneficial), and cerambycids, although injurious alone, were even more so in conjunction with the chrysomelid.  Although the strengths of selection exerted by each herbivore varied from year to year, their relative effects on the plant did not change.  From this result, I argue that selective effects of herbivores on sumac at Cedar Creek are not diffuse, but are consistent from year to year.

AB To understand how populations of salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis) persist in common forest stand types, we studied the above- and belowground structure of salmonberry clones and populations in upland alder and conifer stands, in riparian stands, and in 2-yr-old and 13-to 18-yr-old clearcuts in the central Oregon Coast Range.  On undisturbed sites individual clones and populations replace aerial stems by rhizome extension, by production of new genets, and by sprouts from buds on old aerial stems.  It appears that frequent initiation of aerial stems from these three sources enables salmonberry populations to persist and maintain a dense cover.  The size distribution of aerial stems on these sites resembled that of an uneven-aged stand of trees, with stem numbers decreasing from small to large size classes.  Within the first two growing seasons after disturbance to overstory trees and the understory, salmonberry populations maintained themselves by a rapid initiation of new rhizomes (1.0-2.5 m/m2 annually) and aerial stems (25-50 stems/m2).  These populations apparently continue to grow well, since the greatest rhizome and aerial stem biomass occurred in 13- to 18-yr-old clearcuts with no overstory trees.
   Rhizome density of salmonberry populations, as well as rhizome and aerial stem biomass, was significantly and negatively related (r2 = 0.71-0.83) to the basal area of overstory trees.  It appears that population structure, rhizome length and aerial stem, rhizome, and total biomass, can be predicted from measures of preharvest overstory trees, and also from salmonberry stem number and basal area.
   Clonal architecture varied with stand type.  Salmonberry clones in alder stands were larger (18 m total rhizome) than those in conifer stands and on riparian sites (5-6 m rhizome).  Clones in alder stands also produced more ramets and more aerial stems than those in conifer and riparian stands.

AB Movement behaviors are of central importance to the biology of many organisms, and there are many studies that examine the effects of experimental treatments on such movement parameters as the average direction and distance moved. However, there are few studies that address explicitly the long-term consequences of treatment differences in movement parameters. Instead, it is often assumed that treatment differences in movement parameters will extend, over long periods of time, into treatment differences in long-term, net displacements from a point of origin. I use diffusion models to show that this assumption is not necessarily correct, thus indicating that treatment differences in movement behaviors should be interpreted with caution. In addition, for organisms whose long-term movements can be represented by simple diffusion, I provide formulae that allow calculation of whether treatment effects on movement parameters would be likely to produce treatment differences in long-term displacements. I illustrate these analyses with computer simulations and with data concerning the spread of clonal plants, and I use published values of the diffusion coefficient to help place my results in an ecological context.

AB Coexisting heteromyid rodent species of North American deserts differ in habitat use and in locomotory morphology. Quadrupedal species forage primarily in structurally complex microhabitats, such as under bush canopies, while bipedal species forage in open spaces. A common explanation for this morphology-microhabitat association is that species differing in morphology also differ in vulnerability to predators, that microhabitat structure affects predation risk, and that animals preferentially forage in the safest microhabitats. We tested this for two bipedal and two quadrupedal heteromyid species (matched by body size), and one cricetid species, by quantifying effects of habitat and illumination on activity and on risk of predation by Great Homed Owls.
   Capture frequencies were lower for all heteromyid species than for the cricetid species, Peromyscus maniculatus. Heteromyid activity was lower in open habitat and under bright illumination. Illumination had no significant effect on risk, perhaps because rodents changed activity patterns under full moon to compensate for a potential increment in risk. Habitat, however, did affect fisk: all species were attacked and captured more frequently in the open. Bipedal species were attacked relatively more in the open than were quadrupeds. If these results apply to all predators, they indicate that predation alone cannot account for the divergent microhabitat associations of bipedal and quadrupedal species. Bipedal heteromyids, however, escaped owl attacks more frequently than did quadrupeds of equivalent size. It is therefore conceivable that they experience lower overall risk in nature, where owls may preferentially attack more easily captured prey species when given a choice. Under these circumstances, owl predation could reinforce divergent microhabitat specializations based on some other factor, such as foraging economics, by restricting quadrupeds more strongly than bipeds to the safety of bushes.

AB We studied the effect of age and previous breeding experience on the probability of successful reproduction in female northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris). Reproductive data, collected over a 12-yr period, were analyzed by multiple logistic regression to describe the functional relationships among the variables. We also examined the relationships among age, experience, date of breeding, and reproductive success to determine if differences in timing explain age-specific productivity. Finally, we investigated the relationship among age, experience, and maternal behavior to determine if correlates of reproductive effort could be related to age- and experience-specific patterns of reproductive success.
   Reproductive success increased between the maternal ages of 3 and 7 yr and then levelled off, demonstrating an asymptotic relationship. However, the relationship between reproductive success and age, after statistically controlling for previous experience, showed instead that success increased linearly throughout an animal's lifetime. In contrast, after statistically controlling for age, reproductive success was related to experience in a parabolic fashion; success increased with experience for the first few breeding attempts, but declined later in an animal's reproductive lifetime. The effects of experience depended on age: among young animals experience was apparently beneficial, but among old animals greater experience was deleterious. These results suggest experience-related senescence. Timing of breeding was related to experience, rather than age, in a curvilinear fashion; arrival and parturition dates were later for inexperienced and very experienced females, and were earliest for moderately experienced animals. Young animals that gave birth later in the season experienced reduced reproductive success; we observed no such decline in older animals. Thus, among young females, arriving and giving birth earlier each year was adaptive. Aggressiveness and dominance increased with age and experience, but we were unable to separate the effects of age and experience.
   We contend that the experience-related drop in reproductive success reflects the cost of reproduction. Breeding at a young age and/or continuously appears to result in lower reproductive success later in life. Furthermore, curvature in age-specific reproductive success can be explained by experience-related senescence. This result has general applicability, suggesting that age-related senescence instead may be due to reproductive ''burn-out.'' These results indicate that previous breeding experience and differences in individual quality do not explain the pattern of increasing reproductive success with age in northern elephant seals, and provide indirect support for the hypothesis that animals increase reproductive effort as they age to offset a concomitant decrease in residual reproductive value.

AB The most isolated northern stand of Colorado pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) at Owl Canyon, Colorado, USA has a broad and flat size class distribution common to population expansions, with the largest and oldest trees near the center of the grove. Analyses of fossil packrat (Neotoma sp.) middens within the grove indicate that the stand originated by long-distance dispersal rather than by vicariance, a distinction seldom possible because of the unknown or incomplete histories of such isolated populations. Our 5000-yr pollen and macrofossil record suggests that pinyon pine colonized the site sometime between 1290 and 420 yr BP, the latter age corresponding to the oldest tree in the stand. Electrophoretic data from living trees show that this colonization was not attended by typical founder effects predicted by theory or observed for other known founder events. Despite its isolation, recent founding, and probable long-distance origin, the Owl Canyon stand has not suffered significant losses in genetic variation relative to likely source populations. Large initial population size, multiple founding events, rapid population growth, or selection favoring heterozygous genotypes could all explain the high heterozygosity and only slightly reduced polymorphism and number of alleles per locus found in the Owl Canyon stand. These results demonstrate the genetic complexity of founder events and the utility of blending complementary approaches such as paleoecology and genetics to better understand the population biology of peripheral isolates.

AB In this paper I examine occurrence patterns and habitat use of a New World tropical tadpole species assemblage from primary tropical terra firme forest. First, I describe phenology of reproduction. I then undertake a population approach to examine abiotic characteristics associated with sites used for reproduction by each species. Finally, analysis at a more general level tests to see if some correlative structure exists at the community level, i.e., do sites with similar tadpole species also have similar abiotic characteristics? A significant correlation would indicate, for example, that sites with similar abiotic characteristics also share species assemblages.
   Fifty-three independent aquatic sites were sampled across two consecutive rainy seasons (two 9-mo periods). Twenty-five tadpole species were encountered during the entire study. Significant differences existed among four types of habitats (terra firme pools, peccary wallows, streamside pools, and streams), all located within primary undisturbed forest, with respect to abiotic characteristics such as site permanency and mean depth of water. Most of the rainfall was concentrated between December and May, and phenology of reproduction was strongly affected by the rainfall pattern. For each of the 11 most common species, discriminant analyses revealed the major abiotic characteristics that differed between sites used and not used by those species. On a broader scale of analysis, Mantel tests showed no significant correlations among sites in the similarity of their abiotic characteristics and indices of similarity in their tadpole assemblages. There was also no concordance among sites between either type of similarity and actual proximity of locations. These results indicate that although individual species are responding to habitat characteristics and breed in sites having specific attributes, there are no large-scale species assemblages that covary in habitat use.

AB I conducted a field test of the hypothesis that the dynamics of a predator-prey interaction should be affected by the number of interacting subpopulations within an assemblage. I used a "successful" biological control system, the phytophagous European red mite (Panonychus ulmi) and its predator, the phytoseiid mite Typhlodromus pyri. An orchard was established where apple trees were arranged in groups of 1, 4, or 16 and the dynamics of the mite populations on the trees followed over a season. The pests reached highest densities and were most persistent on trees in the largest groups. These results are explained in terms of an interaction between prey immigration/emigration and predation.

AB Two methods for estimating climatic response functions by measuring realized climatic niche spaces are compared. The first, direct gradient analysis, utilizes measures of abundance of the species at sites spanning the climatic range of the species' occurrence. The second, geographic distribution analysis, quantifies the proportion of the species' total areal occurrence that is found within each climatic zone. A geographic information system is used to digitize species distribution maps and climatic isoline maps, and to compute areas of coincidence. The methods are compared, using independent data sets, on eight species of Californian coastal sage scrub. The position of species maxima along climatic gradients coincided for 75% of the 24 cases in which climatic response from the two methods was compared. This result suggests that the quicker and less expensive geographic distribution analysis method may have value in generating first approximations to climatic response functions. The geographic distribution analysis method is also used to characterize the realized climatic niche space for an additional eight species of Californian hard chaparral. Most species' response surfaces from data throughout the species' range were approximately bell shaped along climatic axes, providing some confirmation of theoretical expectation. The smoothness of such curve shapes will, however, be somewhat sensitive to the scale of sample resolution.

Habitat patches of 0.07-3.61 ha consisted primarily of elm Ulmus glabra and various other deciduous trees, a thick undergrowth of bushes, primarily elder Sambucus nigra, and herbs. Clutch size of all species was independent of habitat patch size even after controlling for time of breeding and age of breeding birds, but brood size at fledging increased with increasing patch size for the Great Tit, European Blackbird, Yellowhammer, Chaffinch, and Black-billed Magpie, but not for the Barn Swallow and House Sparrow. The frequency of nest predation decreased with increasing size of habitat patches in the open-nesting European Blackbird, Yellow-hammer, Chaffinch, and Black-billed Magpie, but not in the hole- or the semi-hole nesters. Brood size of Great Tit, European Blackbird, Yellowhammer, Chaffinch, and Black-billed Magpie increased with increasing patch size even after excluding nests suffering from nest predation. The most productive clutch size measured as the second-order polynomial regression of brood size at fledging on clutch size differed in relation to habitat patch size for the Great Tit, European Blackbird, Yellowhammer, Chaffinch, and Black-billed Magpie, but not for the Barn Swallow and House Sparrow, suggesting that there is no unique optimal clutch size in the first five species. A decreasing fraction of yearling breeding birds was found with increasing patch size in the Great Tit, European Blackbird, Yellowhammer, and Chaffinch, but not in the Barn Swallow and House Sparrow. Habitat patches differed in quality with respect to absolute food abundance and nest predation risks, and territorial species relying nearly exclusively on food resources found within patches or suffering from intense nest predation followed an ideal despotic distribution, while colonial species relying on food resources outside patches followed an ideal free distribution for unequal competitors.

AB Between 1882 and 1886 the water level of Lake Hjalmaren, Sweden was lowered almost-equal-to 130 cm. As a consequence, a large number of new islands arose. From 30 such islands we have complete lists of vascular plant species with notes on their abundance from 1886, 1892, 1903-1904, 1927-1928, and 1984-1985.
   The 112 most important species were grouped as pioneers, early-, mid-, or late-successional, depending on when in the sere they were most abundant or frequent. Several species (referred to as stayers) remained common once they had entered the succession.
   For the 112 species we collected literature data on height, life form, fecundity, mating system, pollination, seed size, dispersal, and relation to nitrogen and light, and the successional groups were compared with regard to these attributes.
   The characteristics of the pioneers were distinct from other groups. Eight of the 13 pioneers were annuals (therophytes), all of which were predominantly autogamous, indicating a strong coupling between these life history traits. After the pioneer stage there was no continuous change in these attributes.
   The seeds in pioneers were not smaller than in early- or midsuccessional species, and seed size did not differ between annuals and perennials. Water dispersal was very important, and therefore dispersal success put no constraint on seed size. Species with the heaviest seeds arrived late; notably they were bird dispersed. Only among wind-dispersed trees and shrubs was there a gradual increase in seed mass over succession.
   The Ellenberg light indicator value showed a slight decrease over time, as did a variable measuring preference for open habitats. We propose that physiology may be more important than life history for species replacements after the pioneer stage.

AB We tested for variation in the intensity of above- and belowground competition along a 5-yr-old experimental gradient of nitrogen availability in a Minnesota old field. Standing crop increased, species richness decreased, and species composition varied significantly as nitrogen availability increased. Transplants of the three greasses that were dominants at the three levels of the nitrogen gradient (low: Schizachyrium scoparium, intermediate: Poa pratensis, high: Agropyron repens) were grown along the gradient with no neighbors present, with only the roots of neighbors present, or with both the roots and shoots of neighbors present. Resource measurements indicated that the treatment with only neighbor roots present provided a light regime similar to that in which all neighbors had been removed but a nitrogen regime similar to that in which all neighbors were present. At low nitrogen availability, transplants grown with only neighbor roots generally did not differ signficantly in biomass or growth rate from those grown with both neighbor roots and shoots, suggesting that the bulk of neighbor effects at low nitrogen were belowground. At high nitrogen availabilty, plants grown with only neighbor roots generally grew significantly larger than those grown with both roots and shoots of neighbors, but not as large as plants grown with no neighbors, suggesting that both above- and belowground competition occurred.
   At low nitrogen availability, plants grown with neighbors weighed 3-12% as much as those grown without; at the highest rate of nitrogen addition, plants grown with neighbors weighed 12-58% as much as those grown without, indicating that competition occurred on both poor and rich soils. The intensity of competition, measured as the suppression of transplants by neighbors, did not vary significantly with nitrogen availability. Further, the per-gram effect of neighbors, measured as the slope of the relationship between transplant performance and neighbor biomass, did not vary significantly with nitrogen supply rate. In total, competition was an important force at all points along the experimental productivity gradient, but competition shifted from being mainly belowground in the least productive vegetation to both above- and belowground in fertilized plots.

AB I used time-invariant and time-varying matrix models to analyze the demography of Leptogorgia virgulata, a shallow-water gorgonian. For a local population in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, I estimated monthly rates of recruitment, colony growth, and mortality in a mapped 24-m2 plot for 2 yr. In a time-invariant model, average mortality and recruitment rates were nearly balanced, so the population growth rate, 1n(lambda), was close to 0.0. An elasticity analysis showed recruitment contributed < 5% to the measured rate of population growth. The most important component of population growth rate was survivorship, particularly of the large size classes. Results were similar for a patch model that incorporated spatial variation in recruitment and colony growth rates. Several published transition matrices of forest trees, which have a similar life history, were also characterized by low elasticities for recruitment.
   Fluctuations in population size of L. virgulata were analyzed with a time-varying matrix model. I randomized certain elements in the 23 monthly projection matrices and simulated the population track. For models with random temporal variation in survivorship, standard deviations (and coefficients of variation) of population size were consistently larger than observed. This result suggests that temporal variation in mortality rates tended to damp population fluctuations. The damping occurred at low population sizes: models with random variation in survivorship generated significantly smaller minimum population sizes than observed. In contrast, population tracks with random temporal variation in recruitment were not consistently different from observed. Although recruitment is widely regarded as an important factor structuring marine communities, its contribution to the temporal (but not spatial) dynamics of L. virgulata was minimal. This finding may be typical of long-lived organisms with delayed reproduction and indeterminate growth, such as forest trees and many sessile marine invertebrates.

AB A food-chain model based on trophic cascade theory predicts substantial variance in ecosystem function at time scales near the lifespan of the dominant predator.  We tested this prediction using time series (1889-1982) of algal pigment concentrations in annually laminated sediments from a lake dominated by planktivorous fishes with lifespans of 3-5 yr.  For pigments that are deposited in sediments mainly by herbivory and are known to be direct indicators of the trophic cascade (alloxanthin, pheophorbide a), variance was pronounced at scales similar to the fish lifespan, consistent with predictions of the model.  Several other sedimentary pigments that have mainly pelagic sources (native chlorophylls, alpha-carotene) also had variance peaks consistent with predictions of the model.  Pigments with multiple sources (fucoxanthin, lutein-zeazanthin, beta-carotene, pheophytin c) had only weakly significant or nonsignificant variance peaks.  Pigments with mainly terrestrial sources (pheophytins a and b) had no variance peaks.  These results indicate that some of the variance in this paleolimnological record is due to the trophic cascade.  Since the scale of this variance component is almost-equal-to 3-5 yr, a 5-yr moving average filters out variance due to the trophic cascade.  Residuals from the 5-yr moving average accentuate variance due to the trophic cascade.  Filtering of the pheophytin time series revealed longer-term cycles (almost-equal-to 15 yr), which may arise from terrestrial or climatic processes.

AB Fine litter deposition and decomposition within the upper tree canopy was measured in a neotropical cloud forest to determine the potential nutrient input to epiphyte communities from intercepted tree litterfall. A comparable amount of fine litter passed through the canopy (752 g.m-2.yr-1) as arrived on the forest floor (820 g.m-2.yr-1), but < 1% of the biomass and nutrients of this ''gross litterfall'' was retained within the upper tree canopy. The standing crop of litter in the canopy (almost-equal-to 170 g/m2 of branch surface area, 8.8 g/m2 of ground area) is equivalent to only 1% of the standing crop of litter on the forest floor. Measurements of leaf litter attrition (whole leaf loss from branches due to wind and other disturbances) with marked leaves documented that 70% of leaves deposited on branches are lost in the first 2 wk and nearly all are gone in 16 wk. Certain branch characteristics (branch angle, number of epiphyte stems and clumps) appear to affect the amount of litter retained at particular microsites. Decomposition of tethered, dead leaves within the canopy over a 12-mo period was half that of leaves on the forest floor (canopy litter turnover time = 2.8 yr). Assuming that litter accumulation within the canopy is at steady state, the biomass of fine litter retained and decomposed within the canopy was calculated as only 2.0 g.m-2.yr-1 and < 0.02 g.m-2.yr-1 for all nutrients. Nutrient replenishment of epiphyte communities appears to be decoupled from the litter-fall pathway, as input from litterfall retained within the canopy is small relative to epiphyte productivity and nutrient requirements reported in other studies.

AB A natural landscape gradient of P-deficient pocosin (evergreen shrub bog) and bay forest ecosystems was used to test three hypotheses concerning P availability and P reabsorption efficiency: (1) that variations in vegetation height and aboveground biomass among even-aged pocosin stands are related to variations in soil P availability; (2) that microbial processes control P availability in these soils; and (3) that the proportion of P reabsorbed from senescing foliage in native plants is inversely related to soil P availability.
   The natural gradient from short pocosin to bay forest was found to represent a gradient of increasing P availability, as indicated by increases in: (1) total P in surface (0-15 cm) soils, from 19.6 to 118.3 kg/ha; (2) seasonal and annual PO43- supply to in situ anion-exchange resins; and (3) P concentrations in native plant foliage. Increases in P availability were accompanied by a significant decline in the N:P ratios of both plant leaves and surface soils.
   Microbial processes strongly influenced the supply of available P. Soil microorganisms immobilized up to 90% of added (PO43-)-P-32 during laboratory incubations, but when microbial uptake was inhibited, as much as 90% of added (PO43-)-P-32 remained in the available pool. A decline in the ratio of microbial: total P in surface soils, from 56.3 to 37.4%, and an increase in the ratio of net: gross P mineralization (estimated by isotope dilution), suggested that as P availability increased, microbial control decreased.
   Native plants reabsorbed both P and N efficiently from senescing foliage, reaching maxima of 86.6 and 80.5%, respectively; natural variations in soil P availability did not affect the proportion of either nutrient reabsorbed. In general, however, plants tended to reabsorb greater proportions of foliar P than N.
   Natural variations in P availability, the factors controlling P availability in these soils, and the potential for differential nutrient reabsorption by native plants have important implications for the cycling and accumulation of P and N in pocosin and bay forest soils. Landscape-level processes may have contributed to the observed variations in vegetation and P availability along this natural gradient.

AB David Lack's "brood reduction hypothesis" to explain asynchronous hatching has recently been tested experimentally on several altricial species of birds. However, for most studies it is not known whether a food shortage occurred not. We induced food shortage by removing the male parent shortly after hatching, in Pied Flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) broods with experimentally reduced and increased asynchrony. The broods were adjusted to an initial size of five. Broods with reduced and increased asynchrony showed a similar degree of partial mortality, fledging on average 3.3 and 3.5 young, respectively. In broods with both parents present and a normal level of asynchrony, all the young fledged. Mean fledgling body masses in reduced (12.6 g) and increased asynchronous (13.1 g) uniparental broods were also similar, and significantly lower than that of biparental broods (14.6 g). Pronounced nestling size hierarchies developed in both types of experimental broods, and female body mass losses during the nestling period were similar. The results demonstrate that, in the Pied Flycatcher, asynchronous hatching is not necessary for the achievement of brood reduction. The differences between broods with reduced and increased asynchrony in numbers and body masses of fledged young were not statistically significant, but were in the direction predicted by the brood reduction hypothesis. The results are inconsistent with Lack's original formulation of the hypothesis, but not with a recent life history modification, which states that asynchrony increases parental efficiency rather than within-season nestling survival.

AB We used data from a 12-yr study of dispersal and breeding success to investigate how female Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) make decisions about movements between nests, both within and between years.  Females were studied on eight separate marshes that were sufficiently close to permit inter-marsh movement.  Our analyses showed that (1) a female's previous success affects her subsequent nesting decision, especially between years; (2) females exhibit strong marsh fidelity; and (3) the presence of familiar male neighbors affects female movement decisions.  Little support was found for the ideas that females move in response to different types of nest predators, familiarity with current mates, or nesting success of other females on their marshes.  Our results suggest that (1) there is more social constraint on changing territories and marshes, especially within breeding years, than previously suspected, and (2) although mate fidelity is relatively weak and unimportant, male "neighborhoods" or "breeding groups" affect female nesting success and, hence, influence movements.

AB We studied the effects of litter of the annual grass Setaria faberii, the perennial herb Solidago spp. (mostly S. canadensis), and leaves of the hardwood tree Quercus alba on a successional plant community.  We also assessed light interception by these litter types in the laboratory.  Light extinction followed the Beer-Lambert exponential law.  Solidago litter had the highest transmittance constant and Quercus litter the lowest.  The three types of litter produced different light mosaics at the microsite (0.8 cm diameter) scale.  In the field, all three litter types affected community structure, but the effect of Quercus was the strongest.  Litter reduced the density of the two dominant grasses, Setaria faberii and Panicum dichotomiflorum.  Quercus and Setaria litter resulted in biomass compensation (i.e., fewer but larger individuals) by S. faberii but not by P. dichotomiflorum, which probably was always outcompeted by S. faberii.  Solanum carolinense, the main dicot in the community, was unaffected by litter addition.  Setaria and Solidago litter enhanced the establishment of Erigeron annuus, but Quercus litter reduced it.  Litter reduced the number of flowering individuals of S. faberii and the number of seeds per plot; Quercus litter increased the production of seeds per individual.  We conclude that species-dependent effects of litter on plant populations may significantly alter interspecific interactions and change plant community structure through direct and indirect effects.

AB The efficiency of nitrogen recovery before leaf fall in different woody species was studied with respect to the phenology of leaf abscission and to different estimates of nitrogen availability.  Among the factors considered, the duration of the abscission period shows the strongest effect on the retranslocation efficiency.  The species with gradual leaf fall exhibit lower percentages of nitrogen recovery, probably due to greater unpredictability of the exact time of abscission.  Gradual leaf fall seems to be an adaptation to water stress in regions with an arid or semiarid climate.  The species that occupy the more xeric sites thus show lower retranslocation rates.  By contrast, the factors related to nitrogen availability show no clear effect on the reabsorption efficiency.

AB Patterns of sex expression were studied in a natural population of the epiphytic orchid Catasetum viridiflavum on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Data on gender and flowering frequency were collected for 2 yr from 186 orchids occurring in both young (70-100 yr old) and mature forests. The distribution of phenotypic gender ratio was strongly bimodal in the population, and sex ratios were significantly affected by forest age. In the young forest the sex ratio was significantly female biased, while the sex ratio in the mature forest was statistically indistinguishable from 1:1. Gender in C. viridiflavum is largely determined by light intensity. Females occurred most frequently in open canopies, and males predominated in closed canopies. Experimental shading of developing inflorescences of well-illuminated plants duplicated this pattern, suggesting sex expression is controlled by cues received by the developing inflorescence. Small, but significant effects of plant size on gender were also detected. Forty-two percent of plants occurred on dead, decaying wood (mostly standing dead trees), while the remainder occurred on live trees. Substrate type and canopy openness are correlated because dead trees present no canopy to shade epiphytes on them. Differences in sex ratio due to forest type resulted from a more frequent occurrence of plants on standing dead trees in the young vs. the mature forest.
   Theory for the evolution of environmental sex determination (ESD) assumes that environment affects reproductive success (RS), but that the relationship between RS and environment is different for males and females. Light availability and substrate were investigated for their effects on two components of RS, flowering frequency and vegetative growth. C. viridiflavum on dead, decaying wood flowered more often than those on live trees, but no significant effect due to canopy openness was detected. The influence of substrate and light availability on estimated rates of vegetative growth varied from year to year, but increased rates were associated with either dead, decaying wood or high light intensities in at least 1 yr. Thus, explanations for the evolution of ESD in C. viridiflavum must include potential effects of both substrate type and light environment on male and female RS. Plants growing on dead, decaying wood in an open habitat that produced fruit exhibited reduced vegetative growth compared to nonfruiting plants, indicating there is long-term cost to fruit production in C. viridiflavum. In forest habitats, females setting fruit on live trees did not flower in the following year. Most nonfruiting females on this substrate type, as well as fruiting and nonfruiting plants on dead trees, flowered in the following year. Although samples sizes supporting this pattern were small, it is consistent with the hypothesis that sex differences in costs of reproduction in response to changes in substrate (and correlated changes in light availability) may explain the evolution of ESD in C. viridiflavum.

AB We studied temporal fluctuations in fruit production by plants and in populations of understory fruit-eating birds at three elevations (50, 500, and 1000 m) in Costa Rican wet forests over a 12-16 mo period to investigate effects of resource variation on bird movements and community structure.  We used mist nets to monitor changes in frugivore abundance, migration patterns, and breeding and molting cycles.  We sampled understory fruits of each forest concurrent with studies of frugivores.  Both frugivores and fruit exhibited considerable seasonal variation in abundance.  Peak frugivore capture rates occurred during peak periods of ripe fruit abundance.  Altitudinal migrants left lower montane (1000 m) forest during periods of fruit scarcity and were present in lowland (50 m) and foothill (500 m) forest when ripe fruit was abundant.  Migrants, both altitudinal and temperate, accumulated fat before migration, and perhaps (for altitudinal migrants) in anticipation of breeding.  Some residents also put on fat before breeding.  Breeding was seasonal at all forests and occurred when ripe fruit abundance was low.  Results of this study indicate that birds may track changes in resource abundance.  Thus, variation in resource abundance influences dynamics of bird communities, both in terms of species composition and abundance.  Further, results illustrate the importance of viewing communities from different scales; dynamics at a local scale (e.g., one elevation) can be influenced by changes in conditions (e.g., fruit abundance) elsewhere.  That some species regularly move along elevational gradients implies that preservation of many species and of the biotic integrity of entire systems may require conservation of large, connected blocks of suitable habitat.

AB Pines growing in unproductive habitats experience more damage by moose than those growing in more productive habitats. This suggests that trees in unproductive habitats are qualitatively different, e.g., more palatable to moose, and/or less able to recover from browsing. Moose browsing was compared on four phenotypes of Scots pine taken from a gradient of forest productivity. The trees were exposed, side by side, at test stations during winter.
   Consumption of twig biomass was highest on pines from the most productive habitat and lowest on those from the moderately productive habitat with an overstory of mature pines. Consumption was intermediate on pines from the least productive habitat and from the moderately productive habitat without an overstory. Pines from the highly productive habitat had greater nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus content and more readily degradable dry matter (when incubated in the rumen of a cow) than did pines from the less productive habitats. Even though they provided a lower quality food for moose, pines in the less productive habitats generally suffered most from moose browsing. The slender twigs and the slow growth rate of these pines allow the moose to browse the main part of the needle-bearing twigs, in contrast to pines from more productive habitats. We also recorded the mortality response to simulated winter browsing in living pines on this same forest productivity gradient. Pine mortality was greater in the less productive habitats than in the more productive ones. These findings largely explain why pines growing in habitats of low and medium productivity suffer more than pines in highly productive habitats, where the possibility for growth is better. Severe damage to stands growing on poor soils most probably arises where moose density is high and where moose have already harvested most of the available twigs from pines growing in the more productive habitats. The moose are then forced to utilize the suboptimal food resources available in less productive habitats.

AB We tested the commonly made assumption that reduction in leaf quality reduces the survivorship of herbivores indirectly by increasing their exposure to natural enemies. Caterpillars of the butterfly Pieris rapae were placed on collard plants that had been experimentally manipulated to have leaves either rich or poor in nitrogen. On low-nitrogen plants caterpillars both developed more slowly and devoted more of their time to feeding than on high-nitrogen plants. When exposed to large (> 2 mm) predators and parasites in a natural setting, the survivorship of caterpillars on low-nitrogen collards was reduced greatly compared to caterpillars protected from predators and parasites. Survivorship of caterpillars on high-nitrogen plants was reduced significantly less dramatically when exposed to predators and parasites. Small (< 1-2 mm) pupal parasites that were able to reach the caterpillars through the mesh of the predator exclusion cages emerged more frequently from individuals reared on high-nitrogen plants.

AB In order to evaluate the relative importance of asexual and sexual reproduction to the fitness of a clonal organism, matrix projection models were used to quantify the contributions of each of these reproductive modes to population growth of the soft coral, Alcyonium sp., a species that undergoes frequent colony fission. The demographic and fitness consequences of eliminating either asexual or sexual reproduction from the life cycle of this species were examined by sensitivity analysis and by altering selected entries in the transition matrices to simulate changes in reproductive allocation.
   Four populations of Alcyonium sp. were monitored photographically for two years to record colony growth, mortality, fission, sexual reproduction, and larval recruitment. Despite high turnover, population densities remained reasonably constant. The 24-52% mortality was matched approximately by recruitment of daughter colonies produced by fission. Sexual reproduction was infrequent, and no larval recruitment was observed. The frequency of both fission and sexual reproduction increased with increasing colony size, while mortality decreased with increasing size.
   Size-class transition matrices constructed from the demographic data were analyzed by the methods of Caswell (1986, 1989). In both years of the study the size distributions of colonies observed in the field did not differ from the stable size distributions predicted from the projection models. Eliminating sexual reproduction from the life cycle did not alter the predicted stable size distributions; eliminating fission shifted the size distributions of all four populations towards the larger size classes. Reproductive value increased with increasing colony size. Damping ratio, rho, a measure of the rate of convergence to the stable size distribution, increased with increases in both fission and sexual reproduction, suggesting that rapidly growing populations are more stable than slowly growing populations.
   Projected growth rates (= relative fitness, lambda) of the four populations ranged from 0.66 to 1.15. Sensitivity analyses indicated that sexual reproduction contributes < 1% of the value of lambda, while > 40% of lambda is accounted for by transitions between the upper size classes in the population, either by fission or growth. Eliminating sexual reproduction from the life cycle had a negligible effect on fitness (lambda); eliminating fission greatly reduced-lambda and suggested rapid extinction for all populations. This result held even when sexual reproductive output was increased by an order of magnitude. The results of these simulations suggest that selection for increased-lambda will increase fission at the expense of sexual reproduction in this species.

AB The abundance and distribution of settlers, recruits, and adults of the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides were monitored in the high, mid, and low intertidal zones at two adjacent, but physically and biologically different sites (A and B) on a rocky intertidal shore in Nova Scotia following a rare occurrence of ice scouring. Availability of planktonic cyprid larvae also was measured at site A. There was a strong concordance between cyprid availability and settler density over the main settlement period among intertidal heights, where each was inversely related to intertidal height. Differences in cyprid availability with intertidal height were related to immersion time as the larvae, in general, were uniformly distributed at the water-substratum interface. Settlement rate was strongly correlated with cyprid availability in the low intertidal zone al site A, where most settlement occurred. In all zones at both sites, recruit density at the end of the main settlement period was a positive function of settler density over this period: on average, 79% of the variation in recruit density was explained by settler density over the main settlement period. Adult density and total settler density also tended to be strongly related: 86% (mid zone at site A) and 73% (high zone at site B) of the variation in adult density was explained by total settler density, except where postrecruitment mortality (i.e., predation) was high (e.g., only 1% of the variation in adult density was explained by total settler density in the low zone at site A). Local hydrodynamics, which influences supply and distribution of planktonic larvae, may dictate the distribution of settlers and, ultimately, adults on this shore.

AB I examine the nonlethal effects of a predator, an odonate larva (Anax junius), on competitive interactions between two species of anuran larvae (bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, and green frog, R. clamitans). The anurans coexist in permanent ponds, which sometimes contain high densities of A. junius. Laboratory experiments indicated that in the absence of the predator, the two species were similar in competitive abilities and grew at virtually identical rates. In the presence of caged A. junius, however, the bullfrog grew to be larger and the green frog much smaller than when the predator was absent. Both species reacted to the presence of A. junius by reducing activity and altering space use. I argue that the reductions in activity in the presence of the predator affected the two species differently, which in turn changed competitive interactions. I discuss the relation between activity level and competitive ability, and the potential for predators to alter competitive relations by affecting activity levels of syntopic species (a higher order interaction). Vulnerability to predators also increases with activity, and I discuss the implications of an activity-mediated trade-off between growth rate and predation risk to interactions among anuran larvae. Finally, I present a method for quantitatively evaluating the net balance of (negative) direct mortality effects and (sometimes positive) indirect effects that alter competitive ability.

AB I examined seed learning and memory in the desert seed-harvester ants Messor pergandei and Pogonomyrmex rugosus to determine (1) which aspects of handling and search efficiency are learned, (2) how fast this information is learned and then forgotten, and (3) how learning and memory affect foraging efficiency. Individuals of both species learned a suite of behaviors that enhanced foraging efficiency on a novel seed species under natural conditions. Handling time per seed and return time (travel time to and from the nest and time inside the nest) decreased for both species. Each species also used specific harvest techniques that enhanced foraging efficiency. Individuals of the larger P. rugosus increased efficiency by increasing the number of seeds harvested per trip. As a result, the percentage of individuals that carried > 1 seed per trip increased over time. The smaller M. pergandei decreased the number of seeds handled before harvesting one, and still harvested heavier than average seeds because they handled but did not harvest lightweight seeds. Messor pergandei also varied the number of seeds handled before harvesting one, such that the fewest number of seeds was handled at low natural seed densities.
   Overall, foraging efficiency of M. pergandei and P. rugosus individuals, measured as seed mass harvested per unit time, increased 1.9- and 3.85-fold, respectively, within one observation period, even excluding the effect of harvesting heavier than average seeds. The difference between species arose because individuals of P. rugosus could carry twice as many of the test seeds as M. pergandei. Memory was clearly an important component of foraging efficiency for both species, as all foraging efficiency indices fell much more slowly than they rose. Tactile-associated behaviors, such as handling time per seed and number of seeds handled, were lost quickly compared to olfactory-associated behaviors such as seed recognition and acceptance.

AB In this study we examined the role of nutrient cycling and herbivory in regulating stream periphyton communities.  Population, community, and ecosystem-level properties were studied in laboratory stream channels that had nutrient inputs reduced compared to channels where ambient nutrient levels were maintained.  We reduced nutrient inputs in four of eight channels by recirculating 90% of the flow, whereas the other four channels received once-through flow of spring water.  We examined the interaction between herbivory and nutrients by varying the number of snails (Elimia clavaeformis) among streams with different nutrient input (circulation) regimes.
   Reduction in nutrient input via recirculation resulted in lower concentrations of nutrients in the water but did not result in significant differences in biomass, carbon fixation, or algal taxonomic composition.  However, herbivory had large effects on these characteristics by reducing biomass and areal rates of carbon fixation and simplifying periphyton taxonomy and physiognomy.  Lower rates of nutrient input significantly affected characteristics associated with nutrient cycling.  Streams with reduced nutrient inputs had lower periphyton nutrient contents, higher ratios of total:  net uptake of P from water, and higher rates of phosphatase activity than streams with ambient nutrient inputs.  However, the effects of reduced nutrient input on cycling characteristics were reduced or eliminated by intense herbivory.
   Our results indicate that nutrient cycling can increase in response to reductions in nutrient input once sufficient biomass or detritus accumulates to facilitate cycling, thereby allowing biomass accrual and carbon fixation rates to be maintained at levels achieved at higher nutrient inputs.  In streams with low nutrient input, cycling can meet a large fraction of the nutrient demand of the periphyton.  Because our experimental design involved a reduction from ambient nutrient levels rather than the usual enrichment tecnhiques (e.g., additions to water, nutrient-diffusing substrates) in aquatic ecosystems, we have been able to observe how biological structure and processes are influenced by external nutrient inputs at the low natural levels of most undisturbed streams.

AB In clonal plants, genetically identical ramets arise from a common stolon or rhizome.  Anatomical connection often allows physiological integration, the translocation of resources from a larger "mother" ramet to a developing "daughter" ramet.  Translocation of a limiting resource can reduce the mother's growth while increasing the daughter's growth.  Our models predict patterns in resource translocation; the models assume that fitness increases with the expected biomass a genet attains over a season of vegetative growth in a stochastic environment.
   In each model a ramet's growth depends nonlinearly on its level of a limiting resource.  If resource availability varies both spatially and temporally, and a ramet's growth does not depend on its size, an analytical approximation for total genet growth leads to several new predictions.  If a ramet's growth increases as a concave function (i.e., a function with decreasing positive slope) of resource level, physiological integration should increase when spatial variance increases and spatial convariance is negative.  If a ramet's growth increases as a convex function (increasing positive slope) of resource level (the less likely case), spatial variance-convariance in resource availability has the opposite effect on translocation.  Independently of the concavity or convexity of the growth function, increasing temporal variance in the mother ramet's resource availability reduces translocation, and increasing temporal variance in the daughter ramet's resource availability increases translocation.
   When a ramet's growth increases with both its resource level and its size, translocation and growth in one time interval influence the value of future physiological integration.  For this case a stochastic dynamic programming model demonstrates how translocation can depend on time and the sizes of the mother and daughter ramets, as well as on spatiotemporal resource variability.  The predictions qualitatively match those deduced from the model of size-independent growth, although translocation often declines late in the season of vegetative growth.  The dynamic model also indicates that a large mother ramet should always share resource with a daughter ramet.  But a smaller mother ramet should often abandon a daughter and allocate all its available resource to its own growth.

AB We examined the ability of eigenvalue tests to distinguish field-collected from random, assemblage structure data sets.  Eight published time series of species abundances were used in the analysis, including data sets for:  fishes, birds, mammals, stream benthos, and crabs.  To test the efficacy of eigenvalue tests, we constructed 1000 randomly generated data sets for each real data set, whose means and variances were identical to the means and variances of the original data matrices.  The data sets were then subjected to a principal components analysis (PCA) and eigenvalue tests used to identify significant eigenvalues for both correlation and covariance matrix solutions.  We also examined the effects of:  (1) number of species (= number of variables), (2) number of samples (= replication), and (3) variance structure, on the performance of the test.
   Using PCA's based on the correlation matrix and with sample sizes typically encountered in the field, the eigenvalue tests generally performed at the .05 level when alpha = .01.  Slightly poorer results were obtained with the covariance matrix.  Increasing the number of samples to at least three times the number of species generally gave alpha level coverage for an alpha level test (i.e., alpha = .05, .01).  Increasing variance in the data set only affected test outcomes at levels of replication less than twice the number of species.
   We conclude that the eigenvalue tests can be used to detect patterns in PCA's of assemblage structure data, if the number of samples is at least three times the number of species and either a covariance or correlation matrix solution is used.  It is assumed that these patterns represent ecologically meaningful patterns of variation.

AB In order to characterize the fire regime of the southern boreal forest and to understand the way in which landscape and fire regime interact, a detailed study of fire history was undertaken in two adjacent contrasting landscapes in northwestern Quebec. The fire history for the islands of Lake Duparquet was reconstructed and compared to that of the surrounding lakeshore. Fire occurrence was determined by archival search and by collection of information from fire scars. Dendroecological techniques were used to determine years of stand initiation on the lakeshore and for a subsample of the islands. Stand initiation data were used to estimate fire frequency, fire cycle, and fire intensity (lethal and non-lethal fires). Tree composition and surficial deposits were sampled in order to assess the possible effect of topography and forest cover on fire frequency.
   Dated fire scars (n = 273) revealed 82 fire years, with the earliest dated to 1593. Islands experienced more fire years (56) than the lakeshore (37), and fire years were uncorrelated. Most (72%) of the lakeshore stands were initiated by a few large fires (eight), whereas the fire size on islands was variable, ranging from < 10% to 100% of the total surface of the island. Despite these differences in fire regime, fire occurrence and fire frequency decreased concurrently on the islands and the lakeshore starting almost-equal-to 120 yr ago. The lakeshore fire cycle was 63 yr before 1870 and 99 yr since 1870, whereas the fire cycle on the islands was slightly longer (74 yr and 112 yr) during the same intervals. The long-term decrease in fire frequency of both the lakeshore and the islands was possibly driven by climatic change.
   Fire frequency was generally similar for all surficial deposits and fuel types on the lakeshore, whereas fires were more abundant in pine woodland growing on bedrock on the islands. Lakeshore fires were generally of lethal intensity, whereas both a long cycle of lethal fires and a shorter cycle of non-lethal fires were observed on 50% of the islands. The morphology and location of islands with both types of fires suggest that a higher frequency of lightning strikes resulted in a regime characterized by more frequent fires and fires of variable intensity. The specific fire regime observed in the island landscape may be the cause of the abundance of pines, whose presence may contribute, in turn, to the continuation of this regime of less intense and more frequent fires.
   We suggest that fire regime in the boreal forest is controlled by long-term climate change at the regional scale, and by a strong interaction with landscape at the local scale, both components having a great impact on the distribution and the dynamics of boreal vegetation.

AB We used 3 x 2 x 2 factorial experiments in a temporary pond to assess the relative importance of predator density (0, 2, or 4 salamander larvae), prey density (20 or 40 tadpoles), and time of prey introduction (early or late) on interactions between predaceous larval salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) and their anuran prey (Pseudacris triseriata). We examined how these factors and their interactions affected mass at metamorphosis, length of larval period, growth rate, and survival. These experiments demonstrated the effect of body size on predator-prey interactions by manipulating time of introduction of size-structured prey in a system with a gape-limited predator.
   Microhabitat differences in primary productivity, sources of predation other than salamanders, and abiotic factors were important determinants of community structure. High levels of salamander predation negatively affected tadpole survival, but affected no other response variable. We detected no density-dependent effects in either taxon. Tadpoles in the early treatment had longer larval periods and lower survival rates than those in the late treatment. Interactions of factors, including time of introduction, were common. Biotic and abiotic factors differentially affecting growth of predator or prey appear to be responsible for these differences.
   Priority effects in arrival to breeding sites, or climatic events affecting the growth rate of predator, prey, or both, play a role in determining community structure. Interactions of factors complicate the predator-prey relationship. In our experiment, the effects of time of introduction are highly correlated with body size in the two temporal treatments. Our results indicate that more realistic models of predator-prey systems, or population dynamics, should incorporate size structure of predator and prey.

AB Geographic differences in host plant availability are thought to result in regional adaptation of herbivores to their sympatric host species. Larvae of Papilio troilus, the spicebush swallowtail butterfly, feed only on plants of the Lauraceae. Although this insect occurs throughout the eastern United States, each host species has a distribution smaller than the range of P. troilus. In peninsular Florida, the major host is Persea borbonia; Sassafras albidum and Lindera benzoin are the predominant hosts elsewhere.
   The hypothesis that P. troilus are better adapted to their sympatric host plants was tested using a split-brood design comparing the larval performance of Florida, Midwest, and hybrid Florida x Midwest full-sib families on Persea, Sassafras, and Lindera. Florida larvae had higher first-instar growth rates and survival on Persea compared to Midwest larvae. In contrast, Midwest larvae had higher total larval growth rates on Sassafras and Lindera relative to Florida larvae. A significant host x geographic strain interaction was also found for pupal mass. Performance of hybrid larvae was intermediate to the parental strains, or equalled the best performing parental strain, depending on the host and performance measure. Regional differentiation in genetically based traits for host use indicates the existence of geographic races in P. troilus.

AB Is the ability to function as a keystone predator a property of a species or an emergent property of the community?  We addressed this question in a temporary-pond community where the broken-striped newt Notophthalmus viridescens doralis is known to act as a keystone predator on larval anurans.
   We independently manipulated the initial density of adult Notophthalmus (two or four) and the presence or absence of one adult Siren intermedia in a set of 20 artificial ponds to determine if this additional predator affected the ability of Notophthalmus to function as a keystone predator.  Each pond received a diverse assemblage of larval anuran prey:  a spring-breeding assemblage of 275 Rana utricularia, 100 Pseudacris crucifer and 25 Bufo americanus tadpoles, and a summer assemblage of 200 Hyla chrysoscelis and 150 Gastrophryne carolinensis tadpoles.  Two additional ponds received neither predator, to assay the outcome of competition among the tadpoles.
   The effect of the salamander Siren on Notophthalmus survival and fecundity depended on the density of Notophthalmus.  At low newt density Siren had no effect on survival, but at high newt density competition reduced the survival and growth rates of Notophthalmus.  The density of Notophthalmus and the presence of Siren interacted to determine the fecundity of Notophthalmus.  At low newt density Siren reduced Notophthalmus reproductive success by preying on larvae.  At high newt density Siren indirectly enhanced reproductive success by reducing survival of adults, thus releasing larvae from intraspecific competition and cannibalism.  Notophthalmus density had no effect on adult Siren survival or growth rate in this experiment, but other evidence indicates that competition with Notophthalmus reduces the growth rates of Siren.
   Notophthalmus acted as a keystone predator on the assemblage of spring-breeding anurans; it increased the number of metamorphs of the weak competitor Pseudacris crucifer by releasing them from interspecific competition.  Siren preyed on tadpoles in a nonselective manner.  An additive model was sufficient to describe the effects of Siren and initial density of Notophthalmus on the structure of the tadpole assemblage.
   In our system of experimental ponds, the strong interaction between Siren and Notophthalmus density did not extend its effects to lower trophic levels, and the direct and indirect effects of Siren did not alter the role of Notophthalmus as a keystone predator.

AB Although the importance of insect viruses in the population dynamics of their hosts is widely acknowledged, ecologists are still relatively ignorant of the factors determining the rate of transmission of insect viruses in the field.  I performed a series of field experiments in which I investigated the transmission dynamics of the nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) of Douglas-fir tussock moth, Orgyia pseudotsugata (Lepidoptera:  Lymantriidae), in northern Idaho, USA.  In these experiments, I reared healthy and infected larvae together on seedling Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and used the number of healthy larvae that became infected as a measure of transmission.  I explored the influences of density, stage structure, and spatial structure on transmission by manipulating the density and stage distribution of healthy and infected hosts, and the spatial distribution of infected hosts.  The experiments indicate that transmission is strongly affected by the densities of both healthy and infected hosts, but the effect depends on the instar of each.  Late instars are both more infectious and more likely to become infected than are early instars, so that the NPV is more likely to spread in populations of late-instar tussock moth larvae.  I also found that transmission is affected by the spatial distribution of infected hosts, and this effect also depends on the instar of healthy hosts.  That is, transmission to healthy early instars decreases with increasing patchiness of infected hosts, but transmission to healthy late instars is essentially unaffected by patchiness.  I discuss how these results can be interpreted in terms of behavioral differences among instars, and relate the results to the mathematical theory of disease and the use of viruses in biological pest control.

AB Two common macroalgae, Cladophora glomerata (a filamentous chlorophyte) and Nostoc parmeloides (a colonial cyanobacterium), are strongly associated with rough substrates in Rattlesnake Creek, a second-order stream in coastal Santa Barbara County, California.  To test the hypothesis that rough texture reduces algal mortality from invertebrate grazers and from winter storms, we conducted a series of experiments on two substrate types (tiles) that varied only in surface heterogeneity.  The dominant grazer, the caddisfly Agapetus celatus, was excluded from tiles using petroleum jelly barriers, and algal establishment was compared with that on control tiles; grazing experments were repeated during spring and autumn.  In a separate experiment, storm scouring was simulated by manually scrubbing naturally colonized rough and smooth tiles at different intervals (7 wk, 3 wk, and once, with an undisturbed control) from December to June, during which algal establishment and survival were monitored.
   In the absence of Agapetus, Cladophora was found nearly equally on rough and smooth surfaces.  Grazers strongly reduced Cladophora establishment on all surfaces (often by > 80%); texture did not generally influence grazing effects in autumn, but refuges (pits) greatly increased algal survival in spring when recruitment was greater.  Two other grazing insects (Baetis spp. and Micrasema) increased on exclusion tiles, apparently due to competitive release, but did not eliminate effects of Agapetus.  Manual disturbance at 3- and 7-wk intervals kept Cladophora densities much lower than on control and once-scoured tiles.  Densities were higher on rough tiles, but the interaction between disturbance and texture was not significant for macroalgae; however, microscopic examination showed that basal filaments, and new sporelings, were protected within depressions.
   Nostoc attained densities in autumn of almost-equal-to 50-100 colonies/100 cm2 on rough tiles and was virtually absent from smooth tiles.  Unlike Cladophora, Nostoc was little affected by grazing, but was greatly reduced by disturbance.  Rough texture provided minor protection, but mature Nostoc formed basal crusts that resisted disturbance, thereby maintaining space in the absence of severe scour.
   Substrate heterogeneity provides refuges from herbivory and disturbance for establishing macroalgae.  While it increasingly appears that herbivory plays a profound role in determining algal dynamics in streams, herbivores and substrate texture may also interact to modify the rate and direction of benthic succession.  By inhibiting the establishment of intermediate taxa (e.g., Cladophora), grazers may restrict succession on smooth substrates to an early, diatom-dominated assemblage, or accelerate dominance by later taxa (e.g., Nostoc) on rugose substrates.

AB We present a simple random model for food web connectance. We model observed webs as random samples drawn from the universe of all possible randomly connected sets of n objects, with no biological interactions assumed. We then drop out links based on observed link-magnitude data and sampling effects. The resulting connectance curves nicely bracket real data, suggesting (1) that food webs may in fact be randomly connected, and (2) the mere fact that previously proposed models can generate the observed connectance values does not guarantee the correctness of the models. This study also suggests that studies of food web topological properties may bear reexamination.

AB Although seasonal patterns of algal succession have received considerable attention, few studies have attempted to elucidate the processes that contribute to short-term algal succession following disturbance. We framed the present study around four general mechanisms of succession in order to investigate the contribution of species-specific autecologies and interspecific interactions to observed short-term patterns of algal succession in a productive third-order stream in Kentucky, USA.
   Observations in different current environments in the stream during two consecutive winters were used to classify dominant species as early or late successional based on changes in relative abundance through time on newly exposed substrates. Assemblages of the same age but differing in the relative abundance of early- and late-successional species were developed in streamside channels recreating both current environments to measure growth parameters (e.g., reproduction) of dominant species and to test for interspecific interactions.
   Of the five dominant species of algae in the winter assemblage, three species were consistently classified as early successional (i.e., decreased in relative abundance with increasing assemblage age) and two species as late successional. Early-successional species differed in their growth form and strategy for initially dominating the substrate, having high densities in the water column, high probabilities of attaching, or fast early reproductive rates. Late-successional species exhibited a more extended growth form and had the highest per capita reproductive rates during later growth. Late-successional species reduced the reproductive rate of early species as succession proceeded in both current environments but were not themselves inhibited by biovolume increases. While differences in growth strategies between early- and late-successional species indicated the importance of passive tolerance mechanisms of succession, density-dependent interactions during community development were consistent with active tolerance mechanisms. As in terrestrial plant communities, successional patterns in benthic algal assemblages appear to result from several processes that defy explanation by a single mechanistic model.

AB Simple theoretical models are used to explore the effect of changed food density on optimal foraging effort when a forager faces a trade-off between energy (nutrient) gain and risk of mortality. Models of simple iteroparous and semelparous life histories show that the optimal effort or amount of risk may increase or decrease with increasing food density. Increases are more likely for iteroparous than for semelparous life histories, and are more likely when the increase in food availability is of short duration. The possibility of starvation makes it more likely that foraging effort will decrease with increasing food density. Organisms whose foraging goal is to minimize mortality are especially unlikely to increase effort in response to increased food availability. If there is a cost associated with the amount of food ingested, effort is more likely to decrease with increasing food. Some limitations of previous theoretical treatments of the foraging effort question are discussed. Previous experimental results illustrate the full range of responses to food density predicted here.

AB Plants utilizing the C4 photosynthetic pathway show higher potential efficiencies in the use of intercepted radiation, water, and nitrogen for the production of dry matter than do other photosynthetic types. C4 Species are most numerous in tropical and warm, temperate semi-arid zones, where their greater water-use efficiency appears to be a key selective advantage. This fails to explain the dominance of a few C4 grasses in floodplain communities of the wet tropics. One such species, Echinochloa polystachya, occurs along the fertile white waters of the Amazon region. In this habitat, where neither water nor nitrogen supply are likely to be limiting to production or survival, a C4 Species may realize its high productivity potential. This possibility was examined by monthly measurements of stand demography, biomass, and radiation interception at a site in the central Amazon. The maximum standing crop of 80 Mg/ha and annual net primary production of 99 Mg/ha of dry matter are among the highest values recorded for natural vegetation. The mean rate of dry-matter production per unit of solar radiation intercepted by the stand was 2.3 g/MJ, an efficiency close to the considered maximum for C4 Species. The significance of this high productivity to the carbon budget of the region is discussed. Despite the investment of most of its high productivity into stem material, growth of E. polystachya was only just sufficient to keep pace with the 8 m rise in water level that occurs as part of the annual cycle in river discharge. In this unusual environment, the high productivity potential conferred by C4 photosynthesis may be essential, in allowing this rooted macrophyte to produce a stem which is of sufficient rigidity and length to hold the canopy above the rising flood waters.

AB Mechanisms influencing the relative establishment success of early successional tree species in North Carolina Piedmont old fields were investigated in multi-factor field experiments.  Six tree species (Acer rubrum, Fraxinus americana, Liquidambar styraciflua, Liriodendron tulipifera, Pinus taeda, and Ulmus alata) were sown into old fields at equivalent densities.  In this paper I evaluate relative seedling performance (survival and growth) with respect to two principal factors:  (1) competition from old-field vegetation (weeded vs. vegetated plots) and (2) browsing by vertebrate herbivores (exclosures vs. open plots).  Manipulation of the first factor tests Connell and Slatyer's (1977) alternative "models" of succession.
   Seedlings were monitored over a 3-yr period in each of two experiments, one initiated in a wet spring (1984) and the other in a dry spring (1985).  Most seedling mortality occurred in the first growing season.  In the 1984 experiment, old-field vegetation reduced survival of all species; however, competitive reductions were not large except in Liriodendron, which appeared unable to survive in herbaceous cover, and in Acer, which survived poorly in the absence of competition as well.  In the other four species, survival in old-field vegetation was similar; after high mortality in the first year, seedlings exhibited continued slow mortality with time.  The dry spring of 1985 resulted in greater overall mortality in all species and greater variation in species responses to vegetation cover.  In contrast to survival, height growth was strongly reduced by herbaceous vegetation in all hardwood species, but not in Pinus, which grew fairly well in competition with the herbaceous community.  Characterization of these responses as tolerance vs. inhibition is complex and requires consideration of long-term demographic behavior.  Three species (Fraxinus, Liquidambar, and Ulmus) were damaged by vertebrate browsers, but browsing intensity varied according to site and was most severe in Ulmus, with the result that its survival and growth were selectively reduced.
   The expected relative prevalence of these hardwood species, based on their emergence success and seedling performance in the experiments, does not fully correspond to their apparent relative occurrence in young Piedmont hardwood communities.  A significant factor that may account for the discrepancies is differential seed rain, which can numerically offset low rates of seedling survival.  Patterns of seed production by the hardwood species appear consistent with this hypothesis.

AB Three Asian honey bee species (Apis florea, A. cerana, and A. dorsata) were studied in Thailand, and compared with the European honey bee A. mellifera, to explore the energy implications of interspecific differences in worker body size and nesting behavior. From previous work on these four species, we know that several measures of the energy-related performance of foragers (body temperature, flight speed, wing loading, and mass-specific metabolic rate) deviate from predicted size-dependent patterns. Instead, workers in the two species intermediate in body size, A. cerana and A. mellifera, appear to be high-powered relative to those of the largest species (A. dorsata) and the smallest species (A. florea). Among the Asian species, A. cerana's colonies also show a disproportionately high mass-specific metabolic rate, and their foragers make many more trips per day in the same habitat than do foragers of the other species. These various traits seem to be functionally related, and to represent evolved differences among species in worker "tempo," i.e., in the rate of performance of colony tasks.
   Correlated with the dichotomy in worker tempo is a dichotomy in nest architecture and intracolony demography. The low-tempo species (Apis florea and A. dorsata) nest in the open, protecting the comb and its contents with a thick curtain of young worker bees. The high-tempo species build their nests in enclosed cavities, which allows the workers to protect and provision a relatively larger area of comb. Worker life-span is longer in the open-nesting species; this allows colonies to maintain the work force needed for the curtain, even though the rate of worker production (per capita) is lower than that of cavity nesters because of the relatively small number of brood cells available. With the assumption that there is a fundamental relationship across species among tempo, foraging performance, and the rate of mortality, we propose that the relatively high tempo of cavity-nesting workers has been favored for two reasons. First, a benefit of higher tempo (enhanced ability to provision brood) is better realized owing to the greater brood-rearing capacity of their nests. Second, a cost of higher tempo (shorter life-span, resulting in fewer workers available for nest protection) is less important for the cavity nesters because the cavity walls reduce the need for protection by workers.

AB We experimented on how illumination, habitat structure, and three different species of owls affected the foraging behavior of Gerbillus allenbyi and G. pyramidum, two gerbil species that coexist on sand dune habitats in the Negev Desert, Israel. We also tested how illumination and habitat structure affected rates of predation by owls on the two gerbil species. In a large aviary, we manipulated presence and absence of owls, owl species, presence and absence of illumination, and shrub cover. In response to the presence of owls or to increased illumination, gerbils foraged less, shifted foraging activity to the bush microhabitat, and quit patches at a higher giving-up density of resources. In accord with moonlight avoidance, both gerbil species suffered higher predation rates under illumination than in the absence of illumination. In addition, G. pyramidum distinguished among owl species, as indicated by changes in patch use and habitat selection. Habitat structure also affected foraging behavior and rates of predation. Gerbils foraged less in the open than in the bush microhabitat, foraged less when there was no cover present, and foraged less in the bush microhabitat when patches were encumbered by entangling branches. In accord with avoidance of open areas, both gerbil species suffered higher rates of predation when shrub cover was 0% than when shrub cover was 10%. With 0% cover, G. allenbyi suffered higher predation rates than G. pyramidum, but with 10% cover, rates of owl predation did not differ between gerbil species. Rates of owl predation on the two species corresponded to their natural patterns of macro- and microhabitat partitioning; relative to G. allenbyi, G. pyramidum predominates on open sand dunes and biases its behavior toward the open microhabitat. The results suggest that predation interacts with resource competition to determine the distribution and habitat separation of G. allenbyi and G. pyramidum.

AB Carex exilis occurs in bogs and fens along the Atlantic coast, but only in fens in the midcontinent. I experimentally tested five hypotheses explaining this pattern. Reciprocal transplants were made, and no differences were found among populations, implying that there are no bog-adapted ecotypes. Instead, C. exilis growth and reproduction depended most on conditions under which plants were grown. Plants from all populations studied could complete their life cycle in coastal bogs, coastal fens, and midcontinental fens, but not in midcontinental bogs. Greenhouse experiments showed that salinity and acidity had no significant effect on germination and growth; increased nutrient supply and water table level did. Seedlings of C. exilis grew vigorously on peat from a midcontinental bog when the water table was kept artificially near the moss surface, but most died when the water table was at its natural level, 20 cm or more below the moss surface. The water table of coastal bogs is normally high. Water level affected competition for light between Sphagnum moss and C. exilis seedlings. Under the drier conditions of midcontinental bogs, Sphagnum overgrew the seedlings; under wetter conditions typical of coastal bogs, seedlings grew faster than Sphagnum, and coexisted with the moss.

AB Field observations on the effect of brook trout on an assemblage (sometimes described as a guild) of predatory salamanders suggest that the interactions among predators in small, headwater streams may be important in determining the structure of this assemblage of predators and thereby, the predation pressure felt by species at lower trophic levels. The interactions among predators and the potential role of those interactions in headwater stream communities was examined in 16 replicated experimental streams. I examined the ecological interactions among four species of co-occurring predators, adult Salvelinus fontinalis (98-122 mm standard length [SL]), larval Gyrinophilus porphyriticus (36-58 mm snout-vent length [SVL]), larval Eurycea bislineata (13-21 mm SVL), and Cambarus bartonii (6-17 mm carapace length [CL]), in an experiment that began in mid-June and ran for 3 mo. Brook trout affected both survival and growth of the larger salamander species, Gyrinophilus, and Salvelinus and Gyrinophilus affected the growth of the smaller salamander Eurycea and the crayfish Cambarus. The presence of Gyrinophilus had no effect on relative condition or fecundity of Salvelinus. Larger predators caused Cambarus and Eurycea to alter their activity levels and habitat, but Gyrinophilus made no adjustments to the presence of Salvelinus. Results demonstrate that Gyrinophilus is vulnerable to predation/aggression from brook trout, but that Eurycea and Cambarus are able to behaviorally avoid predation by both large predators at a significant cost to growth. The effect of brook trout on the two species of salamander in the experimental streams parallels the observed differences between salamanders in trout and trout-free waters in the field. Thus, interactions among predators in headwater streams directly and indirectly influence population dynamics of the interacting species by affecting survival, growth, behavior, and habitat use. The interactions among these predators can determine, in part, the predation environment experienced by individuals at lower trophic levels.

AB Gap-edge trees were significantly more likely to fall into pre-existing gaps than in other directions in a moist tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Trees not at pp edges were more likely to fall away from near neighbors than toward them. We show that gross asymmetries of tree crowns were the rule rather than the exception for all trees. The crowns of most gap-edge trees were strongly asymmetrical into their adjoining gaps, and trees not at gap edges were strongly asymmetrical away from near neighbors. Trees had a strong and significant tendency to fall on these heavy sides. Such treefalls, and related limbfalls, can result in redisturbance of gaps and a retardation of gap regeneration. An analysis of 5 yr of canopy height data from a mapped 50-ha plot on BCI revealed that sites within larger gaps were significantly more likely to be redisturbed by secondary treefalls than were sites in the smallest gaps or nongap quadrats. These results suggest that treefall gaps in tropical forests may be more persistent disturbances than previously thought.

AB Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) is the initial successful woody invader of abandoned old fields in the Piedmont region of North Carolina, but hardwood tree species also invade old fields and develop an understory community beneath young pine stands.  The composition of this early hardwood community will be regulated by factors affecting the relative establishment success of these species in old-field habitats.  Mechanisms influencing differential seedling emergence of such early successional tree species were studied in multifactor field experiments.  Seeds of six wind-dispersed species (Acer rubrum, Fraxinus americana, Liquidambar styraciflua, Liriodendron tulipifera, Ulmus alata, and Pinus taeda) were sown into old fields at equal densities, and their relative germination (emergence) in two successive years was evaluated with respect to:  (1) presence of old-field vegetation (tested with a weeding treatment), (2) vertebrate seed predation (tested with exclosures), (3) variation in life history traits (seed size and germination phenology), and (4) variation in physical factors (spring drought).
   Emergence of one species (Liriodendron) was limited by intrinsically low seed viability.  In 1984, a wet spring, emergence of Pinus exceeded that of all hardwood species, and the smaller-seeded Liquidambar and Ulmus had higher emergence than the larger-seeded Acer and Fraxinus.  Seed predators reduced emergence proportionately more in larger-seeded species than in smaller-seeded species.  Herbaceous cover facilitated emergence of larger-seeded species by providing a moister germination microenvironment, and perhaps also by reducing visibility of seeds to predators.  In 1985 an early spring drought reduced emergence of fall-dispersed species (Pinus, Liquidambar, and Fraxinus), whose earlier germination phenology coincided with the drought.  Later-germinating, spring-dispersed species (Ulmus and Acer) avoided this drought period and displayed similar germination responses in both years.  The prominence of drought effects in 1985 reduced the apparent impact of other experimental factors upon emergence rates.  The emergence stage is an important filter on relative establishment success of tree species colonizing old-field habitats, and multiple "mechanisms" interact in complex ways to influence emergence rates.

AB The isoclines of Gerbillus allenbyi competing with G. pyramidum are negatively sloped and at least approximately parallel. They are not linear, however; they are steeper over both low and high G. pyramidum densities and only very slightly negative at intermediate densities. This nonlinearity agrees with the predictions of the theory of optimal density-dependent habitat selection in a two-species, shared-preference system, the system that obtains here.
   The isocline field was measured by a new method based on the single-species habitat selection theory of Fretwell. The species whose isoclines are being measured (the target species) is given a chance to equilibrate its per capita reproductive rate across a fence that separates two densities of its competitors. Equilibration requires that the target species distribute its density unequally on the two sides of the fence. The general features of the method may be useful in other animal studies where densities can be experimentally manipulated.

AB LaMarche et al. (1984) hypothesized that recent trends of increasing ring widths in subalpine conifers may be due to the fertilizing effects of increased atmospheric CO2.  Five tree-ring series from foxtail pine (Pinus balfouriana), lodgepole pine (P. murrayana), and western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) collected in the Sierra Nevada, California, were analyzed to determine if the temporal and spatial patterns of recent growth were consistent with the hypothesized CO2-induced growth enhancement.  Specifically, I address the following questions:  (1) Can growth trends be explained solely in terms of climatic variation?  (2) Are recent growth trends unusual with respect to long-term growth records?
   For three of the five sites, 20th-century growth variation can be adequately modeled as a function of climatic variation.  For the remaining two sites, trends in the residuals from the growth/climate models indicate systematic underestimation of growth during the past decade that could be interpreted as either CO2 fertilization or as a response to extreme climatic events during the mid 1970s.  At all five sites, current growth levels have been equalled or exceeded during some preindustrial periods.  Taken together, these results do not indicate that CO2-induced growth enhancement is occurring among subalpine conifers in the Sierra Nevada.
   While the results presented here offer no support for the hypothesized CO2 fertilization effect, they do provide insights into the response of subalpine conifers to climatic variation.  Response surfaces demonstrate that precipitation during previous winter and temperature during the current summer interact in controlling growth and that the response can be nonlinear.  Although maximum growth rates occur under conditions of high winter precipitation and warm summers for all three species, substantial species-to-species variation occurs in the response to these two variables.

AB We compared the effects of temperature on rates of microbial respiration, N mineralization, nitrification, and P mineralization in soils from six arctic ecosystems located along a toposequence on Alaska's North Slope.  Soils from these ecosystems were incubated aerobically in the laboratory for 13 wk and at temperatures representative of field values during a typical growing season.  Rates of C and N mineralization were insensitive to temperature between 3-degrees and 9-degrees-C but increased by factors of 2 or more between 9-degrees and 15-degrees.  For both C and N, differences in mineralization rates among soils were greater than differences due to incubation temperature within single soils.  This suggests that the quality of soil organic matter varies widely among these ecosystems and is more important than soil temperature differences in controlling rates of these processes in the field.  Nitrification occurred in all soils, even at 3-degrees, but there were large differences among soils in nitrification potentials.  Overall differences in P mineralization between soils were small.  Rates of P mineralization, however, decreased with increasing temperature in soils from some sites and increased with temperature in others.
   Carbon respired during the 13-wk incubations ranged between 1.5 and 8% of total soil organic C across soil types and incubation temperatures.  In contrast to the relatively high C mineralization rates in these soils, net N and P mineralization rates were very low and were likely due to high microbial demands for these nutrients.  High microbial demand for mineral nutrients can severely limit plant N and P availability in arctic soils.

AB At Monteverde, Costa Rica, the plants Besleria triflora (Gesneriaceae), Palicourea lasiorrachis, and Cephaelis elata (both Rubiaceae) share hummingbirds (Lampornis calolaema) as pollinators. To investigate the effect that intervening visits to Cephaelis flowers have on pollen transfer between plants of self-compatible Besleria or of self-incompatible Palicourea, we presented captive Lampornis with series of hand-held flowers: first, 2 or 15 flowers of either Besleria or Palicourea as pollen donors, followed by 0, 2, or 10 Cephaelis flowers, followed by 20 recipient flowers of the first species. In protandrous Besleria, we used male-phase flowers as donors and female-phase flowers as recipients. In distylous Palicourea, we used pin (long-styled) flowers as donors and thrum (short-styled) flowers as recipients. We assessed pollen transfer by counting pollen tubes in recipients' styles and, in Besleria, by counting pollen grains deposited on stigmas.
   Intervention of Cephaelis flowers strongly reduced pollen transfer among Palicourea flowers. Increasing the number of donor Palicourea flowers significantly increased the absolute amount of pollen transferred but did not overcome the negative effect of Cephaelis. Pollen transfer among Besleria flowers also declined with the intervention of Cephaelis flowers; the decline was less strongly significant than for Palicourea, perhaps because pollen loads on stigmas of some female Besleria flowers can contain self pollen left over from their male phase.
   Under controlled conditions, then, strong competition may exist where plants share pollinator individuals, a situation faced by the experimental species and many others at Monteverde. Other studies on these plants reveal that despite its demonstrability in the laboratory, however, competition among individual plants varies in its ability to explain density dependence in pollination among plant populations in the field. Furthermore, community-level patterns of coexistence among plant species at Monteverde feature few ''ghosts of competition past.'' The collective results demonstrate that studying the role of particular interactions in community structure must involve examinations of mechanisms at the level of individuals, processes at the population level, and patterns of coexistence rather than just one level of this hierarchy. Studying mechanisms alone could exaggerate their importance to community structure, whereas studying coexistence patterns alone could misjudge the strength of interactions among individuals.

AB The study reported here investigates the effects of fire intensity and combustion products (ash and char) on shrub and herbaceous seedling emergence in the field in a mixed southern California chaparral, which was dominated by a facultative seeder, Adenostoma fasciculatum, and by an obligate seeder, Ceanothus greggii. Fire effects were studied in two winter bums, one of which was manipulated by adding brush to experimental plots to increase fire intensity.
   Adenostoma was very sensitive to increasing fire intensity, with decreasing seedling production as fire intensity increased. This was detected within the normal range of fire intensities of a winter bum, and to a greater extent when intensities were experimentally modified. Ceanothus germination was either stimulated by, or very resistant to, increasing fire intensity. Increasing fire intensity also promoted earlier germination of Ceanothus. Herb species were also differentially affected by increasing fire intensities. Among the abundant herbs, fire annuals like Phacelia brachyloba were more resistant to increasing fire intensity than opportunistic annuals like Cryptantha muricata. Seedling production of one opportunistic annual, Lotus strigosus, was, however, stimulated by all levels of increased fire intensity. In most cases, ash and char did not affect field germination.
   Fire intensity can profoundly modify seedling production of shrubs and herbs after a fire. By substantially altering post-fire seedling populations, fire intensity may represent a major factor in controlling species composition and diversity in chaparral.

AB Indirect predator-prey interactions have been suggested to be important in a variety of communities. However, we still understand little about the factors determining the relative importance of indirect and direct effects of predation or what forms indirect predator-prey interactions may take. We examined the direct effects of predation by an omnivorous grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio, and the indirect effects for prey species of interactions between this shrimp and other predators in an estuarine benthic community. Direct and indirect effects of predation were examined in the field using a combination of large- and small-scale enclosure/exclosure experiments. Specific interactions and mechanisms of effects were examined in laboratory predation studies, utilizing both two-species and multi-species systems.
   Grass shrimp predation reduced the densities of a variety of benthic fauna, but the effects varied seasonally and with prey size. Interactions between grass shrimp and other predators took two forms: reduction of an infaunal predator by shrimp predation and predation on grass shrimp by fish. Both types of interactions had a mixed effect on lower trophic levels, with enhancement of certain benthic prey and no effect on other species. Interactions between grass shrimp and their fish predators resulted in changes in shrimp distribution independent of changes in shrimp abundance, creating spatial refugia for shrimp prey. The dynamics of indirect interactions in this community are strongly affected by the omnivorous nature of the major predators. Our results emphasize the general importance of omnivory in regulating predator-prey interactions and in predicting the relative importance of indirect predator effects.

AB Fire and grazing occur together in many of the world's grasslands, but their effects on nutrient cycling have usually been studied as if they acted separately. We hypothesized that grazing by large herbivores results in conservation of nitrogen that would otherwise be lost from burned grasslands. We tested this hypothesis in a series of experiments on burned and unburned tallgrass prairie grazed by cattle. We manipulated grazing using exclosures and mowing. Combustion losses of N from ungrazed plots (1.8 g.m-2.yr-1) burned in the spring were double those from similarly burned, grazed plots (0.9 g.m-2.yr-1). These losses represented about half of the preburn, aboveground stocks of N. The magnitude of N loss was proportional to the standing crop biomass available for combustion. Fire temperatures and energy release were reduced by grazing. We used mowing to simulate locally heavy grazing in patches. In the absence of burning, mowing patches increased the likelihood that a patch would be regrazed and caused persistent reductions in the residual biomass remaining in a patch at the end of the growing season. Mowing did not influence patch utilization or residual biomass when pastures were burned. Thus, the effects of fire on grassland N budgets were modified by grazing, and the effects of grazing on the patch structure of grasslands were modified by fire. We conclude that accurately predicting volatile losses of nutrients from grassland ecosystems resulting from biomass burning may depend on understanding effects of grazing.

AB Field sampling and laboratory experiments were performed to investigate the importance of cannibalism in the isopod Saduria entomon from the Gulf of Bothnia. In the experiments the vulnerability to cannibalism was high for small individuals. The vulnerable phase lasted almost-equal-to 9 mo in the deep zone, and 3 mo in the shallow zone. Large S. entomon individuals caught small conspecifics more efficiently than they caught the alternative prey Pontoporeia affinis (Amphipoda), and Neomysis integer (Mysidacea). Both relative and absolute densities affected the number of small conspecifics eaten. The preference for conspecifics increased with decreasing density of P. affinis. In a behavioral experiment a small but significant proportion of the small S. entomon specimens actively sensed and avoided aggregations of large conspecifics.
   In contrast to the findings of the laboratory experiments, only a small amount of S. entomon were found in the guts of large conspecifics from the field samples. Pontoporeia affinis was the dominant prey. Due to differences in the life history of S. entomon, conditions for cannibalism differ between shallow and deep zones, favoring higher rates of cannibalism in the deep zone. In the deep zone there were lower densities of alternative prey per predator, the vulnerable phase was three times as long, and the cannibals reached larger sizes. Calculations using information from laboratory data showed that cannibalism has the potential to cause substantial mortality in S. entomon in the deep zone also when inflated mortality rates were accounted for. In the field, the density of small S. entomon was negatively correlated with the density of large conspecifics, but positively correlated with the density of P. affinis. The size distributions of the field samples indicated a high mortality in deep-living young S. entomon. These patterns were consistent with the results of the laboratory predation experiments, which are consistent with the hypothesis that cannibalism produced these patterns.

AB Plantago major and P. rugelii maternal plants were grown at two background nutrient levels and received nutrient pulses given at different times during their life-span.  The influences of these maternal treatments on the reproduction of progeny were examined in four different progeny environments represented by two treatments:  with and without competition, and with and without a nutrient pulse.  We found that the effects of maternal nutrient pulses on the two species were related to the environments of both parents and progeny.  When grown without competition, progeny from parent P. major plants maintained at the low background nutrient level and given a nutrient pulse had a higher spike biomass and a higher proportional allocation to spikes than did progeny from parents that did not receive a nutrient pulse.  In contrast, the progeny of parents that were maintained at the high nutrient level showed no response to a nutrient pulse.  In P. rugelii the effect of maternal nutrient pulses on the total and leaf biomass of the progeny was related to both maternal background nutrient levels and nutrient pulse treatments to the progeny.  For both species, the timing of maternal nutrient pulses had no significant effect on the characters studied.
   In competition, for P. major, the progeny from parents given a nutrient pulse during fruit maturation consistently produced a greater amount of spike biomass relative to their neighboring plants from parents that did not receive nutrient pulses, regardless of both the maternal background nutrients and progeny pulse treatments.  However, for the progeny from parents given a nutrient pulse during the vegetative and flowering stages, their competitive ability relative to their neighbors depended on both the timing of maternal pulse and the progeny pulse treatment.  For P. rugelii, the performance (leaf biomass) of the two neighboring progeny depended on maternal background nutrient levels.
   These results show that maternal nutrient conditions can influence competitive interactions in the progeny generation.  The effects may have ecological and evolutionary implications particularly for initial colonization of infertile sites and for the ability of natural selection to act on phenotypic variation.  The strength of these maternal effects depends on both the maternal environment and the progeny environment.

AB Spatial variability in availability of resources that limit photosynthesis (water and N) leads to variation in rates of atmosphere-biosphere exchange.  N content and allocation are canopy properties that link ecosystem, physiological, and biophysical processes and that vary in space at scales relevant to atmosphere-biosphere interaction.  We studied landscape-scale variation in these and related canopy properties in Kansas Tallgrass Prairie (USA).  The tallgrass ecosystem was suited to this investigation because primary production in the prairie is constrained by N availability.  This work was designed to aid in interpretation and spatial extrapolation of gas exchange measurements made using aerodynamic techniques as part of FIFE (First ISLSCP Field Experiment), a NASA-supported study.  We collected data on spatial distribution of biomass, leaf area index (LAI), canopy N mass, N concentration ([N]), and gas exchange along topographic and management gradients.  We also measured height distribution of N, light interception, and gas exchange within canopies as a function of position in the landscape.  Substantial variation in biomass, LAI, N accumulation, and N allocation occurred over time, with topography, and as a result of previous burning.  The vertical gradient of [N] and photosynthetic capacity within canopies were correlated, in space and time, with biomass and canopy light interception.  The gradients were steeper in high biomass sites than in low biomass sites.  In addition, proportional N allocation to the upper layer increased with time (12% in June, 32% in August) as biomass increased.  As nutrient uptake increased within the tallgrass landscape, biomass increased and light limitation in the lower canopy was induced.  As this light limitation increased with increasing biomass, or with accumulation of dead vegetation, allocation of N to the upper canopy increased.  Height distribution of photosynthetic capacity paralleled within-canopy N allocation and light interception.  As resource ratios (light, water, and nitrogen) varied in the landscape, so did rates of gas exchange.  This work suggests that interactions between light extinction, N allocation, and photosynthesis that have been proposed for monospecific stands apply to the multispecies, but structurally simple, canopy of the tallgrass prairie.  Models of plant performance based on evolutionary arguments may provide a powerful basis for spatial extrapolation of atmosphere-ecosystem exchange rates from sites to landscapes and larger regions.

AB The effects of soil fauna on the growth and nutrient contents of birch seedlings were studied in laboratory microcosms simulating the complexity of a coniferous forest floor.  In one set of microcosms partially sterilized soil was reinoculated with soil microorganisms only; another set was reinoculated with microorganisms and a diverse soil fauna.  A birch seedling (Betula pendula) was planted in each microcosm, all of which were incubated in a climate chamber with various temperature and illumination regimes.
   During two growing periods birch-leaf, stem, and root biomasses were 70%, 53%, and 38% greater, respectively, in the presence of fauna.  The N and P contents of leaves were almost-equal-to 3- and 1.5-times higher, respectively, in the refaunated microcosms than in the controls with microorganisms only.  The amount of K, Ca, and Mg in leaf tissue were almost the same in both treatments.  Despite the greater leaf biomass, and therefore more effective transpiration, the water content of the soil remained significantly higher in the refaunated microcosms.
   The results clearly indicate that soil fauna, via enhanced nutrient mobilization and favorable changes in the structural soil properties, exert a positive influence on plant growth.

AB Five grass species (Agrostis scabra, Agropyron repens, Poa pratensis, Schizachyrium scoparium and Andropogon gerardi) were grown in monoculture for 3 yr on an experimental nitrogen gradient. The species differed significantly in the levels to which they reduced soil solution (0.01 mol/L KCl extractable) nitrate and ammonium concentrations and light penetration to the soil surface. Soil nitrate concentration was an inverse function of root mass, which explained 73% of the observed variance in nitrate. Other species differences explained an additional 9.2%, and total soil N an additional 5% of this variance. Extractable soil ammonium also depended on these variables, but total soil N explained the most variance. Light penetration to the soil surface in these monocultures was a negative exponential function of aboveground biomass (R2 = 0.79).
   Schizachyrium and Andropogon, the species that reduced soil solution N to the lowest levels on infertile soils, had lower vegetative growth rates, higher root allocation, lower reproductive allocation, and lower tissue N than the other species. Many of these traits are associated with plants of infertile habitats, suggesting a direct link between ecophysiology, resource reduction, and distributional patterns. Because all species survived on even our most nitrogen-poor soil (subsurface sand), differential nutrient reduction, not tolerance, may be the main mechanism favoring these traits in infertile habitats.
   On infertile soils, the three earlier successional species (Agrostis, Agropyron, and Poa) allocated more to reproduction (rhizome or seed) than the later successional species, but did not reduce soil solution nitrate and ammonium to as low levels. This suggests that our early successional species may be superior colonists but inferior nitrogen competitors compared to the prairie bunchgrasses. Our results can be used to make explicit predictions as to the outcome of nitrogen competition among all possible combinations of these five species.

AB Pollen and plant macrofossil analyses of sediments from three sites in the central Yukon that are presently in shrub tundra provide a record of former forest establishment. Shrub tundra with groves and gallery forests of balsam poplar occupied the region between 10 000 and 8000 BP. At 9400 BP white spruce (Picea glauca) populations expanded, and open white spruce woodlands persisted until 6500 BP when black spruce (Picea mariana) and green alder (Alnus viridis) populations increased, resulting in open spruce woodlands with a distribution of species probably similar to that commonly found today in the northern boreal forest: white spruce on drier south-facing slopes and on alluvial sites with balsam poplar, and black spruce on colder, wetter sites on north-facing slopes and valley bottoms. At 5000 BP forest began to revert to shrub tundra, abruptly at first but then more gradually. The modern groves of spruce in the region, which are mostly white spruce, therefore are probably relict populations surviving in favorable microsites. These results support the conclusion from other recent studies that Alaska and northwest Canada experienced warmer summers than today from as early as 10 000 BP to almost-equal-to 6000 BP in response to increased summer insolation arising from changes in the earth's orbital parameters as predicted by the Astronomic Theory of climate change. The decline of forest after 5000 BP is not associated with any significant changes in the abundance of shrub or herb pollen types, suggesting that the ground vegetation has behaved independently of the tree populations.

AB Controversy over the effect of Quercus douglasii on the productivity of California grassland has been fueled by conflicting reports. In some studies, understory grassland productivity was < 25% of open grassland productivity, whereas in other studies understory productivity exceeded 200% of that of surrounding grassland. We examined light, temperature, soil nutrients, soil moisture, and fine tree root distributions under selected Q. douglasii trees (12 that appeared to have suppressive effects on understory productivity, and 12 that appeared to enhance understory productivity) in order to determine how variations in these factors were associated with the differences in understory grassland productivities. We found that grassland productivity is likely to be facilitated by nutrient inputs via litterfall and throughfall under all trees, but that trees with low understory grassland productivities had substantially higher amounts of fine roots in the upper 50 cm of soil and much lower predawn xylem pressure potentials than trees with high understory productivities and presumably deeper root systems. Root exclosures reduced the negative effects of these trees on the dominant understory grass species, and further experiments indicated that the negative effects of the tree roots may partially result from allelopathic oak root exudates. Thus, shallow fine tree roots may inhibit understory productivity, and variations in Q. douglasii root morphology may explain the intertree variations in facilitating/interfering effects on understory species.

AB To determine if the arrangement of secretory canals in leaves affects foraging by folivorous insects, we examined the behaviors of 33 species found on diverse canal-bearing plants. Insect behaviors were categorized into three principal classes: vein cutting, trenching, and neither behavior. Canal architectures were ascertained by damaging leaves with standardized tests and measuring the secretory response.
   Our observations document a precise correspondence between herbivore behavior and canal morphology. Vein-cutting insects occur on plants with arborescent canals (resin canals in Anacardiaceae and nonarticulated laticifers in Apocynaceae, Asclepiadaceae, and Moraceae). By severing the secretory canals in leaf veins, insects prevent the flow of secretion to distal branches of the canals. Trenching insects, in contrast, are found on plants with net-like canal systems (anastomosing articulated laticifers in Asteraceae and Caricaceae, and exuding phloem in Cucurbitaceae). To eliminate secretion outflow from these plants, the insects must transect all strands of the network by cutting a trench. The secretory canals of the Convolvulaceae (nonanastomosing articulated laticifers) differ from the preceding categories in being restricted primarily to the major leaf veins. The behavior of herbivores on this family is also distinct:  all feed between the major veins without prior vein cutting or trenching.
   Thus, insects employ the same behavior on similar canal architectures, even when their host plants otherwise differ in taxonomy, secondary chemistry, and canal type. The occurrence of vein-cutting and trenching behaviors in multiple lineages of insects that include caterpillars, beetles, and katydids indicates that the behaviors have evolved repeatedly, apparently through convergence. Our comparative analysis supports the view that these preingestive behaviors function specifically to deactivate defensive canal systems.

AB Population samples of an African C4 grass, Panicum coloratum L., were collected from two locations in the Serengeti Grasslands varying in grazing intensity, one a high-grazing location (GA = grazing-adapted), the other a low-grazing location (NGA = nongrazing-adapted). Plants were cloned, put in controlled environments mimicking the natural photo-thermoperiod, and subjected to light grazing pressure by a generalist-feeding North American grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes. Carbon assimilation and redistribution were measured in the short term with an infrared gas analyzer and C-11-labelled CO2, coupled with a three-compartment analytical model, and by harvesting whole plants at the end of a 12-wk regrowth experiment.
   Results documented several significant differences between the GA and NGA samples, suggesting the evolution of physiological traits related to C assimilation, translocation, and storage in response to previous grazing history. Pregrazing net C-fixation rates, translocation rates, and C-storage pools were identical for the two ecotypes. After grazing, overall C-fixation rates were 39% higher for the GA plants, and the regrowth data suggest they remained higher than NGA rates throughout the experiment. Removal of < 10% of initial green-leaf biomass by grazing at each grazing period produced major differences in carbon flux between the two samples.
   Throughout the experiment GA plants produced and stored more C in leaves, stored less C in stem sinks, had higher phloem activity, and translocated more of the labile C to roots where it was stored in higher quantities. This suggests that storage of labile C reserves in sinks or pools readily accessible to the plant, which allows rapid mobilization after grazing, is an important element of adaptation to grazing. Major storage of labile reserves in stems, characteristic of the NGA plants, may be advantageous in ungrazed habitats where there is vertical growth due to canopy closure and competition for light, but such storage makes those reserves accessible to grazers.
   GA ecotype plants in the regrowth experiment compensated completely for the eight weekly defoliation events by the time of the 12-wk harvest; yield of the NGA ecotype was reduced 2 1 % by the moderate level of grasshopper grazing. Increased total yield (biomass harvested plus compensation) by the GA ecotype was expressed in both above- and belowground biomass, suggesting that suppression of the latter does not contribute to compensation by the former.

AB We explored the combined effects of seasonal variation in both pollinator assemblage and availability of pollen donors on pollination in a gynodioecious species, Sidalcea oregana ssp. spicata (Malvaceae).  Hermaphrodites produced flowers with significantly larger petals but maintained fewer open flowers per inflorescence than females.  Flowers of hermaphrodites produced 50% more nectar sugar in the 24 h after anthesis than the flowers of females.  Nectar sugar production was also significantly and positively correlated with petal length.  Pollinator visitation rates were influenced more by differences in petal length than by differences in flower number per inflorescence.  Consequently, hermaphrodites experienced higher visitation rates on a per-flower basis.  Female flowers tended to receive pollen at a lower rate than hermaphrodites, but remained in the receptive female-phase longer than hermaphrodites.  On average, length of the period of flower receptivity declined as pollen deposition rate increased.  These opposing processes resulted in the sex morphs receiving equivalent levels of pollination.  Seasonal variation in the rate of pollen reception was more strongly influenced by the efficiency of the available pollinator pool than by rates of visitation.  Dramatic seasonal shifts in the composition of the pollinator assemblage and pollen availability were correlated with increased pollination intensity as the season progressed.  Not only were more pollen grains received, but they arrived in a shorter period of time and the number of potential pollen donors (hermaphrodites) increased.  These findings suggest that pollen competition in both sex morphs may be more intense late in the season.

AB Rotifers and cladocerans are important components of most freshwater plankton communities. Large cladocerans can suppress rotifers through both mechanical interference competition (IC) and exploitative competition (EC) for shared food resources. We assessed the relative extent by which small- and large-bodied cladocerans suppressed the rotifer Keratella cochlearis by these mechanisms, using circulating algal suspensions in dual-chamber laboratory cultures and natural animal densities. The small-bodied cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia suppressed Keratella exclusively through EC, while a slightly larger species (Daphnia ambigua) did it primarily by this mechanism. Adults (Daphnia galeata mendotae and Daphnia pulex) and subadults (Daphnia pulex) of two much larger bodied cladocerans suppressed Keratella primarily through IC. The ratio of initial Keratella to adult Daphnia pulex density had little effect on the relative importance of the mechanisms-IC always greatly exceeded EC. Suppression by EC occurred in all treatments only after food was depleted below the concentration necessary to support maximal rotifer population growth, while suppression by IC occurred at both high and low food concentrations.
   These two mechanisms by which cladocerans interact with rotifers should affect the composition of natural rotifer communities in markedly different ways; IC should favor invulnerable rotifer species, many of which are large bodied, while EC should favor rotifer species withlow food requirements, which tend to be small bodied.

AB Spatial and temporal variability of surface and groundwater nutrient chemistry was contrasted between two tributaries of the Salto River, which drain the terminus of Pleistocene lava flows in the Atlantic slope foothills of Barva Volcano, Costa Rica.  Some riparian zones along the Salto are saturated by subsurface inflows of phosphorus-rich, geothermal groundwater of the sodium-chloride-bicarbonate type.  The heterogeneous pattern of solute-rich groundwater inflows results in dramatic differences in soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration between stream waters of two closely adjacent tributaries.  SRP levels also vary dramatically in the water table and in soils across stream riparian zones on a scale of metres.  The Salto River (SRP 50-200-mu-g/L) receives steady phosphorus-rich groundwater inflows that become diluted with increasing precipitation.  The Pantano lacks these inputs and retains a low background SRP concentration (typically < 10-mu-g/L).  SRP levels in waters of the Salto were strongly negatively correlated with discharge (r = - 0.86), while in the Pantano there was no correlation.
   In situ nutrient bioassays of algal periphyton growth indicated that both nitrate and SRP were at growth-saturating levles in the Salto while, in the Pantano, algal growth was phosphorus limited.  The Pantano had a high retention capacity for phosphorus as measured through a whole-stream tracer injection experiment.  SRP concentration was reduced by 17 and 94% of injected phosphate over 40 and 800 m reaches, respectively.  Results indicate the important linkage between geothermal activity and hydrogeochemical features of the volcanic landscape and their role in regulating ecological processes in these streams.

AB Many species of detritivorous invertebrates in small streams depend almost entirely on inputs of leaf litter for their nutritional requirements, however the concentration of this resource varies considerably seasonally. An experiment designed to test the hypothesis that productivity of coarse particle detritus feeders (shredders) is seasonally food limited was performed using replicate streamside channels that received one of three input rates of whole leaf detritus (rates equal to those naturally falling into montane streams, and two levels of increased inputs).
   Seven of the nine common shredder species attained significantly higher adult mass, higher densities, or both when food was supplemented. Larval densities of Malenka spp. and Brillia retifinis were significantly higher when additional food was added. Brillia retifinis densities were more than 10 x greater in high food additions than in the "natural" treatment; B. retifinis apparently fills a role as a fugitive in this system and is better able to track shifts in resource abundance by virtue of its short generation time. Zapada cinctipes and Z. haysi were more dense in high and intermediate food input treatments during the last half of the summer. Other taxa had nonsignificant trends to higher densities when extra food was provided. Most of the change in benthic densities can be attributed to decreased rates of emigration with increased food supply.
   Six of the eight taxa for which adult mass at emergence was measured were significantly more massive (4-46%) when food was added. Both sexes exhibited this increase in mass, but females gained proportionally more in most species. There were no detectable changes in the timing of adult emergence due to food manipulations.
   The biomass of most taxa increased in proportion to the overall increase in biomass of the common coarse-detritus consumers. The main exceptions to that pattern were a disproportionate increase in the percentage of the biomass represented by Brillia retifinis and a decrease in the representation of Zapada cinctipes.
   The responses of this community to food supplementation demonstrate food limitation of detritivores. The exponential increase in benthic biomass under food addition shows the scope for productivity if food were not limiting. These coexisting species benefitted from enhanced food supply on a spatial scale that is relevant for population level processes. The large seasonal variation in resource abundance under natural conditions creates bottlenecks during periods of low food supply, which constrain subsequent production even during periods when food is abundant.

AB One of the most pervasive, nonrandom evolutionary patterns is extreme domination of a taxon by one subtaxon or only a few subtaxa. Domination refers to taxonomic diversity and the fraction of the taxon that is classified in the most diverse subtaxon. We attempt to explain how subtaxa come to dominate their phyletic counterparts by examining correlations between taxonomic diversity and life history traits such as age of first reproduction, longevity, fecundity and partitioning of reproduction, and resource availability in a variety of vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant groups. Regardless of taxonomic group or rank, the number of taxa within an assemblage, or the school of taxonomy employed, diverse taxa were characterized by short generation time (early age of first reproduction and short life-span) and the ability to contact many resources (high mobility and high resource availability). We suggest that the intrinsic character of short generation time increases diversity because it promotes speciation and reduces extinction. Extrinsic factors such as resource availability and environmental complexity and variability may have a secondary influence on diversity by constraining or enhancing speciation for taxa with short generation times.

AB We studied carbon dioxide concentrations in a mixed deciduous forest in New England, USA by making continuous measurements at 0.05, 0.2, 3, and 12 m above the soil surface.  The measurements began in early March and continued until the end of November 1985; therefore, they spanned the growing season and parts of the dormant seasons both before and afterwards.  The data were compared with those from Mauna Loa, Hawaii, which represent global atmospheric CO2 levels in the Northern Hemisphere.  The results show strong seasonal and daily variations in CO2 concentrations at all heights in the forest.  On average, during the growing season, CO2 levels were generally higher in the forest than in bulk air at Mauna Loa.  The highest level of CO2 was found near the forest floor and the lowest at the 12-m level.  Daily levels of CO2 were constant throughout the day in the dormant season and were the same for all heights in the forest.  However, during the growing season, the CO2 concentrations were lowest during the middle of the day, especially at the 12 m height.  Thus, this study shows that the CO2 concentrations in the forest may be quite different than those in bulk air and that seedlings, saplings, and mature trees may experience different CO2 environments for which they may show different responses in photosynthesis, growth, and water use.  Moreover, a tree may experience different CO2 environments as it grows towards the canopy, and different modules of an individual may also be growing in different CO2 atmospheres.

AB American eels (Anguilla rostrata) use three different modes when handling food: suction, shaking, and spinning (rotational feeding). We investigated mode selection and mode switching during foraging in terms of relative costs and benefits of different modes. Eels were fed food items that differed in size and consistency, thereby inducing particular modes. To test the hypothesis that American eels forage efficiently by selecting foraging modes that maximize net energy intake and growth, we determined whether modes differed in short-term energy costs and long-term effects on growth rate, and whether eels preferred food types that maximize short- and long-term net benefits.
   Net energy intake (energy ingested - energy consumption represented by oxygen uptake) was greatest when suction was the chief mode employed, and was reduced during shaking and spinning. Animals using spinning fed the slowest and ate relatively little food. Eels fed a diet that required them to feed by only spinning or shaking lost mass faster than eels allowed to feed by suction. When given a choice of food types, eels preferred energetically efficient types (suction over both shaking and spinning, shaking over spinning). Our results suggest that rotational feeding is an alternative foraging mode that facilitates dismembering of large food items, but this benefit can be compromised by energy and time costs. Spinning is the least preferred mode and is used when other modes are ineffective. Mode switching in this species can be considered optimal in that mode choice and switching appear to maximize net energy intake in a manner that directly affects growth rate and, presumably, fitness.

AB The interaction between two species is usually assigned as though they were in isolation from all other species. Here we use a (known) method that determines species interactions more realistically, within the framework of the community to which they belong. This ''inverse'' method evaluates all the effects that one species experiences from another, both direct and indirect. We use this method to study the classical (though highly controversial) ''competition community,'' where each species is considered (in the ''isolated pair'' approach) to suffer from the presence of every other. The model we use takes account of the fluctuations in interaction coefficients that one must expect in the real world, both from one species pair to another, and as the effect of ambient environmental variations.
   Remarkably, the ''inverse'' method finds that generally a high proportion (20-40%) of the interactions must be beneficial, or ''advantageous,'' when not lifted out of the community context in which they actually occur. The contrary case, called here ''hypercompetitive,'' in which each species suffers from every other species, can occur only if the environment is nearly constant, and the species closely akin to each other, with both of these conditions holding and persisting to a degree that must be considered implausible.
   The results of the model remain valid, even after incorporating a number of major structural modifications, thus indicating robustness in its predictions. We survey the available field data and show that they are in good general agreement with the conclusions reached, on the high proportion of interactions which must be ''Advantageous in a Community Context'' (ACC).

AB Natural densities of common stream-dwelling harpacticoid copepods, Attheyella spp., reduced the density and biomass and increased the area-specific and cell-specific production of detritally associated bacteria. Bacterial density was reduced by as much as 58% and rod-shaped bacteria were reduced as much as 27%. Attheyella selectively removed larger rod-shaped bacteria. This resulted in a significant change in the size-frequency distribution of rod-shaped bacteria and a decrease in median cell length by 17-30%. The removal of larger sized cells by Attheyella probably contributed to the observed reduction in bacterial biomass. With copepods present, bacterial biomass was reduced as much as 45%. Estimated rates of ingestion of bacterial carbon by copepods are comparable to values for marine harpacticoids. Bacterial biomass appears to be a more important food source to microdetritivores than to macrodetritivores in streams.

AB Experiments were conducted to determine if three plant defenses affected the parasitoid Cotesia congregata in a fashion that would influence herbivore-parasitoid interactions. We evaluated the developmental rate, size, and survival of the parasitoid Cotesia congregata, when reared from Manduca sexta fed on diets containing either nicotine, rutin, or hordenine. These results were compared to the effects of the same three chemicals on unparasitized M. sexta. The influences of the three plant defenses differed. In general, however, the effects of these allelochemicals on the parasitoid paralleled those on the unparasitized hornworm. The one major exception was that concentrations of nicotine that had little or no effect on the hornworm caused significant mortality of parasitoids. Neither rutin nor hordenine had large or consistent negative effects, although rutin had a pronounced effect on both hornworm and parasitoid developmental times.

DE FORAGING; MODELING; PERTURBATION; SPIDERS
AB Field work concerning a sheet-web spider, Lepthyphantes flavipes (Linyphiidae), found on the upper surface of a deciduous forest litter indicates that a physical perturbation like falling leaves has a major effect on spider movement. The proposed optimal foraging model using stochastic dynamic programming includes perturbation movement as opposed to foraging movement between web sites, with variable prey availability in space and time. The two possible strategies (fixed-site strategy or mobile strategy) are constrained by different energy costs and predation risks. Decision is based on prey availability of an occupied web site and on internal fat reserves. It is found that a fixed-site strategy is optimal in good web sites (better than the habitat mean) and in poor web sites when spiders have high fat reserves. A mobile strategy is optimal in poor web sites at low reserves. An optimal mobile strategy is much less profitable than an optimal fixed-site strategy, but the latter is interrupted by perturbation. The model may explain the prevalence of the fixed-site strategy in L. flavipes and in Linyphiidae in general.

AB Within species of polyphagous herbivores, individuals may prefer or have greater fitness on one host than on others within the species range. Such intraspecific specialization can be caused either by genetic differences or by the effects of experience (conditioning) on a given host plant. Separating the causes of intraspecific variation in host use is an important issue in understanding the potential for host shifts in herbivorous species.
   In the pea aphid, a polyphagous pest of forage crops, various clones collected from a local area have been shown to be specialized such that they have higher fitness on either alfalfa or red clover. The experiment reported here was designed to test whether this observed specialization could be significantly altered by prolonged experience on the alternate plant species. In a factorial design, replicate lineages of two specialized clones were maintained on both alfalfa and red clover for three generations; each line was then tested on both crops. Experience on the alternate crop had no significant effect on the relative performance of these two specialized clones. These results support the suggestion that differences in host plant performance among pea aphid clones are genetically based. They also suggest that individuals that move between crops are likely to be selected against, since they appear to be unable to significantly improve in performance through time as a result of experience. Such selective elimination of intercrop migrants will promote genetic divergence of nearby subpopulations on different crops.

AB A stochastic model of plant population dynamics is developed and analyzed to determine how density and age structure depend on thinning rates and disturbance regimes. Probability distributions of age and density are derived from the distribution of regeneration niches on a landscape and the thinning rates of cohorts on patches created by adult mortality or larger disturbances. The theory is then extended to different types of disturbances that operate at different scales and are interdependent, such as treefalls that only become important as the early-successional trees that initially colonize an area affected by a larger scale disturbance become mature.
   In general, landscapes that provide frequent regeneration niches support high-density young stands. Density distributions are negatively skewed. Decreasing frequency of regeneration niches results in lower mean density, higher variance, and increased (less negative) skewness. When regeneration niches are rare, density is low, variance is low, skewness is positive, and the age classes are highly variable. In more complex cases, regeneration niches may depend on the time since the last large disturbance; for example, canopy gaps can become more frequent as postfire cohorts become senescent. Then age class distributions on a given disturbed area become increasingly platykurtic with time; skewness is negative for early-successional species and positive for late-successional species. The exponential distribution of age classes commonly observed in late-successional species is the asymptotic result of a more general distribution that depends on time since the last disturbance. Across a landscape that supports these interdependent disturbance processes, infrequent disturbances result in density distributions for late-successional species with large mean, negative skewness, and low variance. An early-successional species is present at low density with positive skewness and low variance. Density distributions for both species types are more platykurtic and have higher variance when disturbance frequency almost-equal-to thinning rate. Frequent disturbances produce higher densities of early-successional species with positive skewness and lower densities of late-successional species. The landscape distributions of age classes are J-shaped for both species. With frequent disturbance, age distributions are leptokurtic for both species, but more so for late-successional species. Age class distributions are increasingly platykurtic with less frequent disturbance. The "intermediate" disturbance frequency that maximizes the probability of being reproductively mature at the time of the next disturbance event (Clark 1991a) is also that which maximizes the density of reproductive individuals on this shifting mosaic landscape.

AB Using several adjacent Great Basin desert and Sierran montane trees and shrubs, we tested the prediction that water-use efficiency (WUE) is lower in more drought-tolerant species.  We also measured maximum net photosynthetic rates and photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE) to determine if these attributes decrease at high WUE.  Differences in the physiological responses to resource availability were more clearly evident between growth forms, trees vs. shrubs, than between vegetation types, montane vs. desert.  The shrubs (Amelanchier alnifolia, Arctostaphylos patula, and Artemisia tridentata) maintained higher rates of net photosynthesis at lower predawn water potential but had lower WUE than the trees (Juniperus osteosperma, Pinus monophylla, P. jeffreyi, and P. ponderosa).  PNUE was highest in the shrubs that also had the highest foliage N content, and PNUE was inversely related to WUE.  However, trees had higher nutrient retranslocation efficiency and growth-based NUE than shrubs.
   Low WUE and high drought tolerance of shrubs suggests that maintaining high WUE under competitive water-limited conditions may not be advantageous.  In contrast, conservative use of water (high WUE) and high growth-based NUE by trees lengthens the season of net carbon assimilation and more closely matches growth with low rates of nutrient availability on nutrient-poor sites.

AB We examined effects of differing levels of physical belowground space on the performance of several colonizing annual species in two experiments.  Individual plants were grown in controlled greenhouse conditions under an experimental regime that independently varied nutrient addition rates and the physical space available for the deployment of roots while maintaining water supply at adequate rates.  When equal amounts of nutrients were given, plants grown in greater volumes had greater vegetative growth and often higher reproductive output.  Species differed in patterns of response to physical space in both vegetative and reproductive parameters.  Abutilon theophrasti given larger soil volumes increased allocation to reproductive tissues relative to vegetative tissues.  Setaria faberii, however, responded through a phenological shift:  earlier flowering and greater reproductive output in smaller volumes.  These results indicate that physical underground space, released in the formation of certain types of gaps, may influence the performance of colonizing annuals beyond providing access to other soil resources, such as nutrients and water.

AB Little is known about the influence of genetic diversity in plant populations on the dynamics of plant viruses, particularly those transmitted by insects.  For these viruses, plant genetic diversity may affect virus incidence through impacts on the population dynamics of the vector insects or through impacts on vector feeding behavior, which determines transmission of the virus.  This study was designed to explore the influence of plant genetic diversity on virus dispersal by aphid vectors and to examine the biological mechanisms responsible for that influence.
   In a set of field experiments using the aphid-transmitted barley yellow dwarf virus, I examined the influence of genetic diversity in oat (Avena sativa L.) populations on the spread of the virus and on the population dynamics and movement behavior of aphid vectors of the virus.  Only at relatively high aphid abundance were the densities of aphid vectors influenced by plant genetic diversity.  In one year out of three, densities of the oat-bird cherry aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.), were significantly lower in the genetically diverse stand than in the genetically homogeneous stands.  In no year were densities of the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (F.), influenced by the host-plant population.  Despite these weak or absent effects on vector abundance, the incidence of the virus was consistently lower in the genetically diverse oat populations.
   Disease reduction in the diverse populations appears to depend upon changes in aphid movement behavior that affect the efficiency of virus transmission.  Mark-release experiments with S. avenae demonstrated that movement rates were significantly higher and plant tenure times were significantly lower in the genetically diverse oat populations.  Because the barley yellow dwarf virus requires several hours of aphid feeding for effective transmission, these reduced tenure times and increased travel time among plants led to a reduction of virus transmission.
   While plant genotype can clearly influence herbivorous insects dramatically, this study suggests that the effects on insects of genetic diversity per se in the host-plant population are likely to be subtle and not easily detected using standard field sampling techniques, except at high insect densities.  Yet even at low vector densities, behavioral responses to plant genetic diversity can lead to significant effects on the spread of pathogens.

AB The effects of different light and soil nutrient conditions on foliar chemistry and acceptability of Inga oerstediana seedlings to leaf-cutter ants were investigated. I determined differences among (1) leaves that were initiated and matured under identical conditions but subsequently were subjected to different light and fertilization treatments and (2) leaves that were initiated and matured under different soil, light, and fertilization treatments. I also assessed the relationship between environmentally induced differences in plant growth and the production of carbon-based secondary chemicals (specifically, tannins). Finally, I determined whether increases in tannins corresponded to decreases in the acceptability of leaves to leaf-cutter ants.
   Once a leaf matured the concentrations of tannins did not change as a function of light and soil nutrient conditions despite very large differences in growth rates among the treatments. Leaves that expanded to maturity under different soil, light, and fertilization treatments did differ in tannin chemistry, and treatment differences in plant growth rates appeared to dictate tannin chemistry. When growth was light limited, tannin concentrations were low, but when growth was nutrient limited, tannin concentrations were high.
   Only leaves that expanded to maturity under different environmental conditions differed in their acceptability to leaf-cutter ants. Decreases in tannins did not result in parallel increases in acceptability. Despite higher concentrations of tannins, leaf-cutter ants preferred the leaves of seedlings that were grown at 20% light over leaves of seedlings grown at 2% light. However, fertilization increased the acceptability of leaves when seedlings were grown at 20% light, a result consistent with the avoidance of very-high-tannin leaves.
   From these results I suggest that spatial variation in resource availability in lowland tropical rainforests would result in differences in tannin chemistry, and in susceptibility to leaf-cutter ants. However, temporal changes in resource availability would only be important to tannin chemistry and susceptibility if the duration of the change were long enough to allow new leaves to be produced.

AB By providing supplemental food to Marsh Tits (Parus palustris) from the day the first egg was laid, effects on clutch size could be directly attributed to food without the confounding effect on laying date.
   Females provisioned with additional food responded by laying, on average, one egg more than control females. Differences in territory quality did not influence this result because, on territories occupied in both years, one more egg was laid in the year of provisioning. Although the rate and amount of extra food provided were equal during the two experimental years, the resulting clutch sizes of provisioned females differed between years by more than one egg in absolute terms. Further, the mean clutch size of provisioned females declined seasonally in parallel to that of unprovisioned females. I conclude that clutch size in Marsh Tits is determined by a tactical decision based on declining values of offspring with the progress of the season. However, within the limits set by this tactical decision, the availability of food during egg-laying also plays a role.

AB Because food and habitat are closely linked for small herbivores that live on plants, food choice in the field may be constrained by the need to choose plants that provide safe living sites. We investigated the importance of food value and refuge value in determining the plant utilization patterns of the herbivorous marine amphipod Ampithoe longimana. When offered a choice of five common seaweeds, this amphipod fed most readily on Dictyota and Hypnea and less readily on Sargassum, Chondria, and Calonitophyllum. Rates of feeding on the different seaweeds were unrelated to seaweed gross morphology, toughness, nitrogen, or protein content. When cultured on each of these seaweeds in the laboratory, amphipod survivorship was high on Dictyota (82%), intermediate (35 and 18%, respectively) on Sargassum and Hypnea, and low (0%) on the other seaweeds. Survivorship on the different diets was strongly correlated (r = 0.930) with algal protein content; however, neither protein content nor amphipod performance on the different diets was significantly related to feeding rates on those diets. Additionally, amphipods from the three seaweed species that produced some survivors did not differ in growth rate, fecundity, egg size, or age at first ovulation. Variance in survivorship, and related measures, among sibling groups of amphipods suggested that this amphipod population possessed heritable variation for performance on the different seaweed species.
   In the field, abundance of A. longimana on the different species of algae was more clearly related to the preference of omnivorous fishes for these algae than to feeding rates of the amphipods when given those algae in the laboratory. A. longimana was more abundant on Dictyota and Sargassum (both unpalatable to omnivorous fishes), than on Hypnea, Chondria, and Calonitophyllum (all of which are palatable to fishes). During the season when omnivorous fishes were abundant, density of A. longimana increased on Dictyota, which is chemically defended from fishes, but decreased or remained unchanged on the seaweeds that are more palatable to fishes. Competition with other amphipods as a group did not appear to explain the distribution of A. longimana among seaweeds, since there were no negative correlations between A. longimana abundance and total amphipod abundance in any month. The lack of any consistent relationship between host-plant use in the field and either feeding preference or diet value, as measured by survivorship and reproduction, suggests that host-plant use by A. longimana may be strongly constrained by requirements for shelter from predation.

AB We studied numerical and functional responses of breeding European Kestrels (EK) (Falco tinnunculus), Short-eared Owls (SO) (Asio flammeus), and Long-eared Owls (LO) (Asio otus) during 1977-1987 in 47 km2 of farmland in western Finland. The pooled mean yearly breeding density varied from 0.1 to 2.4 pairs/km2. The number of nesting EKs (range 2-46 pairs), SOs (0-49), and LOs (0-19) fluctuated in close accordance with the spring density of Microtus (M. agrestis and M. epiroticus) voles. The mean yearly number of fledglings produced per pair ranged from 0.4 to 3.8 and, for each species, was positively correlated with spring density of Microtus voles. Due to their high degree of mobility, EKs, SOs, and LOs were able to track the population fluctuations of their microtine prey without time lags. An increase in microtine densities caused a rapid immigration into the study area and a decrease caused a rapid emigration from the area.
   Microtus voles were the most important prey group by mass in the diet of each species. Water voles, bank voles, shrews, and small birds were the most frequent alternate prey. The spring density of Microtus spp. was positively correlated with the percentage of these voles in the diet of EK, SO, and LO. The pooled functional response curve of these three raptor species to the fluctuating densities of Microtus spp. was close to linear, indicating that consumption rates are independent of vole densities. Breeding EKs, SOs, and LOs seemed to take a larger proportion of voles available in peak years than in low ones.

AB High marsh habitats in New England exhibit conspicuous Zonation of vascular plants. Spartina patens and Juncus gerardi dominate the seaward and terrestrial borders of the high marsh, respectively, whereas Distichlis spicata is common in disturbed habitats. In this paper I examine the role of interspecific interactions among these marsh perennials in maintaining marsh plant zonation.
   Removal and transplant experiments were performed to examine species interactions in dense stands. In both types of experiments J. gerardi competitively dominated S. patens and D. spicata, while S. patens competitively dominated D. spicata. Each of these perennials showed maximum growth when transplanted into the J. gerardi zone without neighbors. J. gerardi appears to dominate the terrestrial border of the marsh by competitively excluding S. patens to lower marsh levels, while D. spicata is competitively restricted to disturbed habitats by both J. gerardi and S. patens.
   Species interactions during the colonization of bare patches were strikingly different than those found in dense vegetation. Colonization of bare patches by both S. patens and D. spicata facilitated the colonization of J. gerardi, the competitive dominant in dense vegetation. Bare patches in the high marsh are typically hypersaline due to increased surface evaporation in the absence of plant cover. Patch colonization by competitive subordinates, which are relatively salt tolerant, appears to reduce substrate salinity by passively shading the substrate and, as a by-product, facilitate the invasion of a superior competitor.
   While interspecific competition in dense vegetation dictates the zonation of New England perennials in the high marsh, secondary succession in this assemblage may commonly be driven by facilitations. This scenario may not be uncommon among assemblages in harsh physical environments where plants or sessile animals ameliorate their physical environment.

AB The effects of facultative epiphytes on a bivalve host were studied on an islet near Santa Catalina Island, California.  The primary cover in the mid-intertidal zone was a mosaic of red algal turf (Corallina officinalis, Gigartina canaliculata, and Gelidium coulteri) and clumps of the mussel Mytilus californianus.  In certain circumstances the algae attached to and overgrew the mussels.
   In other marine habitats, facultative epibionts benefit bivalve hosts by masking them from predators.  At Catalina, spiny lobsters (Panulirus interruptus) and oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani) preyed on intertidal mussels.  However, in tagging studies, overgrown mussels displayed a nonsignificant trend towards lower survivorship.  A factorial experiment manipulating exposure to predators and the cover of epiphytes demonstrated that over-growth significantly reduced survivorship.  There was no significant statistical interaction between treatment effects, indicating that the presence of algae did not protect the mussels from predators.  Overgrown mussels also had significantly lower rates of growth and reproduction than naturally clear mussels of similar size and location.  Experimental removal of the epiphytes caused significant increases in mussel growth and reproduction relative to overgrown controls.
   In the community circumstances chosen for this study, the epiphytic habit is a part of the processes in which otherwise freeliving algae become dominant on the rock surface.

AB Studies of diet choice in carnivorous animals typically concentrate on maximizing rates of energy intake, and rarely emphasize either constraints on choice or alternate currencies. We examined diet choice in a generalist carnivore, the Herring Gull, Larus argentatus, in relation to both nesting habitat and reproductive performance over a 2-yr period. During prelaying and incubation periods 75-80% of Herring Gulls specialized on either intertidal organisms, human refuse, or other seabirds, while only 20-25% had generalized diets. Specific types of specialists tended to nest in particular habitats. Foraging tactics associated with each of the three diets were related to time budgets and ecological constraints, i.e., levels of predation or intraspecific competition in specific habitats. Variation in diet choice was also strongly related to individual breeding performance. Intertidal specialists laid eggs earlier, produced larger and heavier clutches, and had higher rates of hatching than generalists and other specialists. This pattern held true over both years of the study even though weather conditions, and food accessibility, differed between years. Despite differences in performance related to laying and hatching, there were no significant differences in fledging rates, either between years or among diets. These results suggest that (a) choice of nesting habitat may constrain diet choice, (b) diet choice may have major effects on breeding performance, and (c) energy may not be the proper currency for examining diet choice in carnivores subject to a variety of constraints.

AB The vegetative and reproductive growth of tropical forest plants often occurs in short bursts separated by longer quiescent periods. Seasonal changes in moisture availability may be a cause and, if so, may cue growth in a proximate sense or limit growth in an ultimate sense. Two 2.25-ha plots of mature forest were irrigated for three consecutive dry seasons on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, to discriminate among the various possibilities. The responses of three Piper species and four Psychotria species are reported.
   Irrigation disrupted the timing of leaf flush for all seven species. Irrigation increased annual leaf production for just one species, however, and had no effect on annual inflorescence production for the Psychotria nor on stem radial growth. These responses are consistent with the hypothesis that water stress constrains the timing of growth while only rarely limiting total annual growth. However, leaf turgor potentials observed among control plants may not have been sufficiently low to constrain leaf and inflorescence production, and other effects of irrigation cannot be discounted. Possible phenological cues that were affected by irrigation include soil moisture content, air temperature, relative humidity, and the timing of nutrient inputs from decaying litter. There was no evidence that a "water stress requirement" must be met during the dry season before wet season budbreak. The gradual decay in synchrony for leaf production for all four Psychotria species suggests that endogenous rhythms contribute to growth periodicities in this genus.

AB Myrica faya, an introduced nitrogen-fixing tree, is rapidly invading volcanically disturbed forests in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the island of Hawai'i. We investigated the direct effects of Myrica on the establishment and growth of the native tree, Metrosideros polymorpha, in a forest that is recovering from burial under a 10-200 cm deep layer of volcanic cinder. The number of Metrosideros seedlings found under Metrosideros trees, in the open, and under Myrica trees was 0.12/m2, 0.01/m2, and zero, respectively. Myrica litter inhibited Metrosideros germination in field experiments; germination occurred only when Myrica litter was removed.
   In open sites, the addition of nitrogen-rich Myrica soils increased dry mass accumulation of transplanted Metrosideros seedlings. Shade from Myrica canopies (or shade cloth) increased survivorship and height growth but not dry mass accumulation of Metrosideros seedlings.
   Isolated Metrosideros trees increased diameter growth in response to nitrogen fertilizer but not in response to the presence of adjacent Myrica trees, despite previous findings that Myrica trees elevate available nitrogen in the soil. Myrica basal diameter and height growth were consistently greater than that of Metrosideros in all size classes. Although Myrica does not readily invade closed, late-successional Metrosideros forests, on young, volcanically disturbed soils it is rapidly establishing dense, monospecific stands under which Metrosideros does not regenerate.

AB The food hypothesis of population regulation was tested using two predation-free populations of feral donkeys in tropical northern Australia. Growth, body condition, and age-specific rates of fecundity and mortality were compared between the two populations. One of the populations was roughly one-half the density of the other, following an experimental reduction 3-4 yr previously. Fecundity was high and independent of density, with > 70% of mature females pregnant in both populations. Age at maturity and juvenile mortality displayed some density dependence. Populations conformed to predictions of the food hypothesis, abundance being ultimately regulated by food-related juvenile mortality. At high density, juvenile mortality was there times as great as at low density, and was associated with poorer juvenile body condition and slower growth. Differences in rates of juvenile mortality are associated with nutritional status of lactating females, which is in turn determined by density-dependent competition for quality forage. The effects of competition for forage upon juvenile mortality synchronize lactation with an annual flush of quality forage at the onset of the monsoonal wet season.

AB During a 4-yr study, we examined how an insect herbivore indirectly influenced pinyon pine by affecting its avian seed dispersal agents.  Colorado pinyon pine, Pinus edulis, suffered reduced cone initiation and increased cone mortality primarily from infestation by the stem- and cone-boring moth Dioryctria albovitella.  Because avian dispersal agents selectively foraged where cone crops were highest, individual trees and stands of trees with greater insect abundances were avoided.  Even herbivore-resistant trees with substantial cone crops did not receive dispersal services if they were surrounded by susceptible trees because the birds often ignored entire stands of trees.  A cone removal experiment showed that avian seed dispersers also ignored trees with artificially reduced crops even though many cones remained.  We argue that masting, the production of large cone crops at irregular intervals, may have eolved to insure dispersal success.  The decline in attractiveness of entire stands of trees to dispersal agents due to infestation may functionally alter the sex expression of uninfested individuals.

AB Seed production of a flower depends both on the quantity of pollen received and on its "quality" as manifested in rates of germination, ovule fertilization, and seed maturation.  Disentangling effects of these two factors is complicated by the fact that seed set is a decelerating function of pollen quantity.
   One potential element of quality is the genetic similarity of pollen donor and recipient.  In ten experiments with Delphinium nelsonii, seed set varied with outcrossing distance, a correlate of genetic similarity.  Over all experiments, a 10-m distance significantly (P < .02) outperformed shorter and longer distances by 23-33%, suggesting quality differences.  To explore this possibility, we fit decelerating negative-exponential regressions to relationships among stigma pollen load, pollen tube number reaching the ovary, and seed set in a subset of experiments having 1-, 10-, and 100-m treatments.  Regression parameters suggested that 10-m pollen is most efficient at producing tubes and seeds, and analysis of residuals from pooled regressions (a nonlinear ANCOVA) showed that 10-m residuals were most positive.  The latter effect was significant for pollen load-seed set relationships (P = .009, five experimental replicates) and pollen tube-seed set relationships (P = .021, two replicates), but not pollen load-pollen tube relationships (P = .128, three replicates).
   These results illustrate the utility of nonlinear regression in distinguishing pollen quantity and quality.  They reinforce the conclusion that outcrossing distance affects pollen quality in D. nelsonii, and that an "optimal outcrossing distance" between 1 and 100 m maximizes seed set on average in pollinations using one donor per carpel.  Insofar as quality differences persist in natural pollen mixtures that arrive on stigmas, outcrossing distance should affect reproductive success through both paternal and maternal sexual functions.

AB Grazing of wooded grasslands by domestic stock has led to dominance by woody plants, in many parts of the world.  In semi-arid grasslands in Australia Dodonaea attenuata is a common, invasive shrub of perennial grasslands on sandy soils.  There is evidence that cohorts of D. attenuata establish infrequently in vigorous grasslands and more frequently where the perennial grass has been damaged by overgrazing.  This study examined the influence of herbaceous growth on mortality of D. attenuata seedlings, by growing them in plots with controlled moisture input.  The herbaceous layer in the plots was either natural, clipped, or killed.
   Without summer irrigation all the seedlings in the natural grassland died.  Seedling survival was inversely related to the amount of herbaceous growth on the other treatments.  Summer irrigation maintained D. attenuata seedlings and produced a large biomass of perennial grass, which left the seedlings susceptible to grass fires.
   A water-balance model was run for the experimental site for the 97 yr of climatic records.  The soil-moisture patterns associated with the establishment of three known cohorts of D. attenuata were identified.  The model output was interrogated for similar soil moisture patterns in other years.  It was estimated that only six widespread D. attenuata establishment events have occurred in 97 yr.
   In intact grasslands D. attenuata rarely establishes densely, and when it does so it is susceptible to grass fires.  Modern management has increased establishment frequency by increasing the availability of summer soil moisture by overgrazing the grasslands and has suppressed grass fires.  This has changed open grassland to dense shrubland.

AB Pairwise competition experiments were performed for 3 yr on an experimental nitrogen gradient at Cedar Creek Natural History Area, Minnesota, where N is the major limiting resource during early succession. Agrostis scabra, an early successional grass, competed against another early (Agropyron repens), a later (Schizachyrium scoparium), and an even later (Andropogon gerardi) successional species. On low N soils, Agrostis was competitively displaced by each of the later successional species, but persisted with Agropyron. On high N soils, Agrostis was displaced by all three of the other species. The inferior competitive ability for N of the early successional species refutes the resource ratio hypothesis of succession. Rather, the high allocation of Agrostis to seed and its rapid colonization of fields support a colonization-competition hypothesis of succession.
   For two of three cases, the outcome of competition on low nitrogen soils was predicted by R*, the nitrogen concentration to which monocultures of each species reduced extractable soil nitrate and ammonium on N-limited soils. In these cases, the species with the significantly lower R* for nitrogen displaced the other species. In the third case, the species had more similar R* values, and the species with the lower R* had not displaced the other species within 3 yr (but it had done so after 5 yr; see Note added in proof).

AB The selection of prey by two species of shore-dwelling birds was compared with the predictions of a simple optimal diet model. The preferences of African Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus moquini) and Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus) for different size classes of the sand-burrowing bivalve Donax serra were examined. Gulls took only large clams, regardless of the availability of the different size classes. This preference is ascribed to the high energy expenditure required for gulls to open clam shells. Oystercatchers, which open bivalve shells relatively easily, took both small and large clams, even when large clams were abundant. The selection of small clams when large clams were abundant appears to have resulted from the lack of discrimination of clam sizes by oystercatchers and the temporal segregation of availability of small and large clams.

AB Leaves that show paraheliotropic movement are inclined at a shallow angle with respect to the horizontal near dawn and dusk, and at a steep angle near solar noon.  However, the mean inclination angle is only a first approximation to the distribution of leaf angles, and, as such, is not a good measure of the complexity of the underlying distribution.  In order to ascertain the accuracies of statistical summaries of angular data used to measure the orientation of plant leaves for intercepting light, I used cellulation plots to analyze the distribution of leaf angles or cosines of the angle of incidence.  Examination of these plots shows that inclinations of leaves in the top canopy layer of individual heliotropic plants are distributed over a wide range of angles during a period of several hours before and after solar noon, but that there is a sharp lower limit to this distribution of angles.  Experimental observations show that near midday leaves are inclined at least at some minimum angle with respect to the horizontal.  In order to interpret these data, I used a simple model of plant canopy photosynthesis and optimized the distribution of leaf angles to maximize total canopy photosynthesis.  The results of this model suggest that the existence of a limit angle may be a function primarily of stress factors, and that the distribution of leaf angles more vertical than the limit angle may be important primarily for maximization of whole-plant photosynthesis.

AB Older chaparral stands are frequently characterized by gaps in the canopy and by a lack of herbaceous vegetation in these openings.  Many causes for the lack of herb growth in gaps have been postulated, including lack of seeds in the soil, limited nutrients and water, competition with shrubs for resources, interference competition (i.e., allelopathy), and herbivory.
   An experiment was conducted to assess the individual and combined effects of four main factors (trenching to reduce root competition, caging to reduce herbivory, nutrient addition, and water addition) on herb germination, survival, and growth in chaparral dominated by chamise, Adenostoma fasciculatum.  We found strong interactions among these treatments.  Therefore, no single factor can be regarded as causing the absence of herbs in chaparral.  Herb establishment was limited by herbivory and root competition with shrubs for limited nutrients and/or water.  Survival was enhanced by trenching, caging, and water.  Growth was enhanced by nutrient addition, but the magnitude of this nutrient effect became appreciable only within trenched, caged plots.  The vegetative cover of annual herbs in gaps was limited by the combined effects of herbivory, competition with the roots of shrubs, inadequate nutrients, and inadequate water.

AB Treefall gaps are thought to contribute to the diversity of plants in tropical forests by providing opportunities for niche differentiation in modes of regeneration.  To examine this hypothesis, we studied the survival, diameter growth, and recruitment of saplings in > 100 species of woody plants in a 50-ha permanent plot of moist tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, from 1982 to 1985.  The performance of saplings in low-canopy sites (< 10 m) was compared to that of saplings in high-canopy sites (greater-than-or-equal-to 10 m), and performance of common species was compared to that of rare species.  Of the 108 species for which all three parameters of performance were measured, 104 fell into four response groups, each with characteristic patterns of survival, growth, recruitment, and response to canopy height.  Pioneers (six species) survived poorly in both canopy-height categories, and survivors grew rapidly in low-canopy sites.  Sapling recruitment was skewed toward low-canopy sites.  Understroy specialists (three species) survived well in high-canopy sites and poorly in low-canopy sites.  They grew slowly and recruited poorly in both situations.  Generalists (79 species) survived well and grew slowly in both canopy-height categories.  Per-adult recruitment was usually low, and often skewed toward low-canopy sites.  Poorly performing species (16 species) survived poorly, grew slowly, and recruited infrequently in both canopy-height categories.
   Most of the common (> 10 saplings/ha) species appeared to be generalists.  Many rare (< 1 sapling/ha) or occasional (1-10 saplings/ha) species survived significantly (P less-than-or-equal-to .05) less well than the average survivorship of saplings, while many common species survived significantly better than average.  Some rare or occasional species grew rapidly, either in low-canopy sites or in both canopy-height categories, while most common species grew slowly in both situations.  Rare and occasional species had significantly more recruits per adult than did common species, but often this did not balance their higher mortality.  Large differences in survival, growth, and recruitment between canopy-height categories were found only among rare and occasional species.

AB To learn whether vine stems are less structurally stable than shrub stems, I studied the architecture, anatomy, and mechanics of western poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), a plant that grows as a vine when provided with external support but otherwise as a shrub. I assessed the relative structural stabilities of vines and shrubs, and the relative importance of stem morphological vs. material properties for this structural stability using the following types of information: aboveground architecture and biomass distribution, and geometric, anatomical, and material properties of the stems. Shoots that were supported by a fence (vines) had a lower proportion of their dry mass in primary stem and had more aboveground dry mass, more leaves, and a greater total length of stem than did unsupported shoots (shrubs). Both growth forms had about the same proportion of their biomass at a given relative height above the ground. Supported shoots were taller and had lower stem taper (change in radius per unit length of stem) than did unsupported shoots, and, in a common garden, had longer internodes. Xylem of supported shoots had a higher proportion of vessel lumen and lower maximum thicknesses of fiber cell walls than did xylem of unsupported shoots. Supported stems were less stiff (had lower apparent material stiffness in bending) than unsupported stems at diameter less-than-or-equal-to 3.5 cm. A simple model showed that the lower taper and lower material stiffness of vines yielded much lower flexural stiffness in vine than in shrub stems. A second model showed that simplified shrub stems could reach almost 11 m before becoming structurally unstable. Actual shrubs from the modelled environment, however, never exceeded 3.2 m in height. A simplified vine modelled for the same environment would become unstable at 1.2 m, whereas vines in the field can be over 30 m tall. These findings suggest that for poison oak (1) shrubs are overbuilt and vines are underbuilt for self-support, and (2) the higher structural stability of shrubs than vines is due mainly to differences in stem geometry, not to differences in stem material properties.

AB We used laboratory feeding trials to examine the responses of copepods to a variety of cyanobacteria of differing size, morphology, and toxicity. Diaptomus birgei exhibited behaviors ranging from strong preferences for some taxa of cyanobacteria to almost complete rejection of other taxa when allowed to feed in low-concentration mixtures of a high-quality green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardi, and each of 16 taxa of cyanobacteria. Our results demonstrate the overriding importance of chemical factors. Copepods exhibited very high clearance rates for some filaments and colonies but rejected morphologically similar strains shown to contain potentially toxic compounds.
   Responses to resource abundance exhibited three patterns, each consistent with the assumptions and predictions of an optimal diet model. First, selectivity for high-ranking cyanobacteria declined in high-concentration mixtures with Chlamydomonas relative to selectivity in low-concentration mixtures. Second, a test of the effects of time without food showed that hunger, rather than food concentration per se, was responsible for these shifts in selectivity. Finally, each toxic strain was consistently ingested at very low rates, even when offered as the sole food resource. Experiments with complex mixtures of natural seston revealed similar patterns of consistently strong discrimination against a presumably toxic cyanobacterium and concentration-dependent selectivity for presumably nontoxic taxa.
   Our results show how the behavioral flexibility of copepods can be adaptive in lakes with significant populations of cyanobacteria. The ability of copepods to feed size-selectively on filaments and colonies and to discriminate against toxic forms suggests that these grazers may be important in the evolution and continued success of toxic strains.

AB Several recent models have been proposed to explain the pattern of species distribution within a region.  Brown's niche-based model, Levins' stochastic immigration-extinction model, and Hanski's core-satellite hypothesis (a modification of Levins' model) differ in relative spatial scales, and degree of stochastic variation in species distribution over time.  To test the predictions of these models, we analyzed the regional distribution and temporal dynamics of plant species across 19 sites in tallgrass prairie over an 8-yr period.  Spatial patterns of species regional distribution were bimodal each year, a pattern in accord with the core-satellite hypothesis.  In addition, temporal patterns of species distribution within a site were also bimodal.  The dynamics of the core-satellite hypothesis are driven by patterns of immigration and extinction.  Extinction was positively related to richness, however, in contrast to the theory of island biogeography, immigration was not related to species richness.  In addition, the variances in the differences in species frequencies from one year to the next were greater than three times the mean, a condition necessary for bimodality in the core-satellite model, for 88 of 135 (65.1%) species.  These results provide strong support in favor of the core-satellite hypothesis and imply that stochastic factors may be the primary determinant of plant species dynamics and plant community structure in grasslands at the scale of several kilometres.  Evidence from prairie communities at much larger spatial scales supported the patterns predicted by Brown's niche-based model.  Thus, these apparently competing models are, in fact, compatible when viewed at the appropriate spatial scale.

AB Differences among habitats in the relative availability of prey and inorganic nutrients suggest that carnivorous plants should vary their investment in prey capture.  We tested this hypothesis using the carnivorous plant Utricularia macrorhiza, which is common in lakes exhibiting a broad range of nutrient conditions.  We assessed U. macrorhiza investment in carnivory as the density of prey-capture bladders per leaf.  Field surveys revealed that the number of prey-capture bladders per leaf varied significantly among lakes but was highly consistent within a habitat.  Differences in the number of bladders reflected an increasing proportion of plant biomass in bladders.  Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the number of bladders was positively, not negatively, correlated with specific conductance of a plant's habitat water.  Reciprocal transplant experiments of plants from lakes with many or few bladders per leaf revealed that the number of bladders per leaf is plastic, capable of changing on new leaves over a period of a few weeks.  Experimental manipulations of animal prey indicated that a plant's bladder number per leaf is a direct response to water chemistry rather than to prey availability.

AB Arctic geese nest in a highly seasonal environment in which ungrazed plants reach peak nitrogen concentrations when goslings hatch (Sedinger and Raveling 1986).  Grazing by geese prolongs peak nutrient concentrations but reduces food availability.  This should cause nutrient availability to decline seasonally.  Here, we test the hypothesis that late-hatching goslings of Black Brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) grow more slowly than those hatching early.  We subtracted the sizes of wild goslings from those of captive-reared goslings of the same age and regressed the differences against hatch date.  Differences between wild- and captive-reared goslings for body mass, tarsus length, and culmen length were significantly negatively related to hatch date; i.e., late-hatching wild goslings were smaller than those hatching early, after accounting for age.  We detected no between-year difference in gosling size, but male goslings were larger than females of the same age for all measures.  Egg size was only weakly associated with size of goslings 1 mo after hatching, but we detected no effect of other brood characteristics on growth.  Seasonal variation in gosling growth rate may favor early nesting in arctic geese.

AB We studied the dynamics of a serpentine annual grassland in northern California in relation to disturbance by pocket gophers (Thomomys bottae) and interannual variation in rainfall over the period 1982-1988.  Mapping of gopher mound formation indicated that the probability that gophers would disturb any given area during the 6-yr study period had a near normal distribution with a peak at two disturbances during that period.  Disturbance levels varied considerably from year to year and spatially, and thus the disturbance regime is complex.  Exclosure experiments indicated that gopher disturbance had a significant effect on the abundances of many of the grassland annuals, perennial grasses, and cormaceous species.  Aboveground herbivores had no detectable effects.
   Over the period of the study annual rainfall varied threehold and plant community dynamics were strongly affected by this.  In particular, Plantago erecta decreased and Lasthenia californica increased in abundance with increasing rainfall.  Abnormally high rainfall in 1982-1984 allowed the buildup of populations of Bromus mollis, the only nonnative species that invades the serpentine significantly.  B. mollis was, however, subsequently virtually eliminated from the serpentine grassland by two consecutive years of severe drought.  Invasion of B. mollis was found only on gopher mounds formed in 1983.  In subsequent years recolonization of gopher mounds was predominantly by other species, in particular Lotus subpinnatus.  Interannual variability in species abundances was most apparent on disturbed microsites.
   Our results provide a longer term perspective from which to view shorter term experimental and modelling work and highlight the need for long-term observations of ecological systems.

AB The adaptive significance of the timing of oviposition in the thistle-feeding lady beetle Epilachna niponica was investigated at two localities (site A and site F) in the northwestern part of Shiga Prefecture, central Japan. I followed cohorts produced over a season and measured four components of lifetime fitness: egg survival, larval survival, female adult survival from emergence to the reproductive season in the following year, and lifetime fecundity. These data are based on mark-recapture data for > 9000 adult beetles and detailed life tables over 5 yr.
   Large variation in lifetime fitness was evident among cohorts within a population, but the two local populations showed a clear difference in patterns of cohort fitness. At site A, cohorts produced early in a season had higher lifetime fitness than later cohorts, whereas at site F, later cohorts (except for the last one) tended to have higher lifetime fitness. The major causes of these between-site differences were seasonal variation in intensity of egg and larval mortalities due to arthropod predation and host plant deterioration.
   Field observations revealed a significant difference in oviposition phenology between the two sites: early reproduction at site A and delayed reproduction at site F. The relatively longer reproductive life-span of females was responsible for the prolonged reproduction at site F. Results of a laboratory experiment that eliminated environmental variables agreed with the field observations, and suggested a genetic basis for the oviposition schedules. Correlation of reproductive pattern at each site with higher lifetime fitness of offspring suggests selection on the timing of oviposition to improve the lifetime reproductive success of females.

AB Root(1988b) proposed that a physiological limit on metabolic rate constrains the northern distributions of wintering birds. Thermoregulation requires that metabolic rate increase as temperature declines, and hence a ceiling on metabolism that is reached before food or other factors become limiting would set the northern extent of a species distribution.
   I compared data with two predictions stemming from the proposal. First, there should be close correspondence between the northern range boundaries of species and temperature isotherms. To test this, I re-evaluated the data and found that only 8-42% of the species that Root classified as limited by temperature had northern range boundaries that corresponded to particular temperature isotherms. The second prediction examined was new: Species' northern limits should scale to body mass, because the ceiling on metabolism is stated as a multiple of basal metabolic rate, which itself scales to body mass. Large species should extend farther north than small species. A test of the prediction using Root's data showed little evidence that a constraint strongly affects the distributions of birds. In a second test, I analyzed additional recent Christmas Bird Counts that include areas farther north than were available to Root. I found that species of all sizes occur at the lowest temperatures, indicating that a ceiling on metabolism does not generally constrain the distributions of birds wintering in North America.
   My analysis turned up one other unexpected result: Few large passerines in North America have northern distribution boundaries that occur in warm, southerly areas, whereas as small species have northern distribution boundaries in southern as well as in northern areas. The pattern might reflect the relationship between body size and the size of a species' geographic range coupled with the geography of North America. Large species tend to have only large geographic ranges, whereas small species are not so restricted. The avifauna of North America north of Mexico is bounded by a barrier formed by the Gulf of Mexico and a turnover in avifauna between the United States and Mexico. To the north of such a barrier, the northern distribution boundaries of large species should be well away from the barrier because of their large size.

AB We tested the hypothesis that spatial scale of investigation has an effect on the probability of detecting density dependence in the field. Specifically, we examined parasitism rates by two different parasites of one host (the salt-marsh planthopper Prokelisia) with different dispersal capabilities. One parasite, the wasp Anagrus, attacked host eggs and flew widely over the marsh, traveling on the order of kilometres. The other, the strepsipteran Elenchus, parasitized host nymphs and adults. Females of this parasite cannot fly, and dispersal is by triungulinid nymphs, which walk on host plants and can only disperse on the order of metres from their spent maternal corpse. We found no dispersing planthoppers to be carrying Elenchus. We expected no density dependence by Elenchus on a large scale, that is, over an area of 1-2 km2 but possibly some evidence of density dependence on a small scale, that is, within a few metres. By similar logic, we expected Anagrus perhaps to show density dependence at both scales because it disperses so well.
   Parasitism rate by both insect species varied widely both in space, even between adjacent sites, and through time. We found little evidence of density dependence for either type of parasite at any spatial or temporal scale. Failure to detect density dependence may be due less to the effect of looking at the wrong spatial scale than to the idiosyncratic behavior of individual parasite species.

AB We asked what factors keep the seed beetles Stator limbatus and S. pruininus (Bruchidae) restricted to different species of Acacia (Leguminosae) in sympatry. Factors assessed were plant microenvironment, interspecific competition, suitability of seeds for food, and enemy impact. Females selectively oviposited on seeds of their normal host when given a choice of acacia seeds in their normal host microenvironment. This result occurred whether seeds of the other acacia were offered with or without potential competitors in them. Host suitability was determined by comparing full-siblings on both acacias. Three performance variables were measured: (1) emergence per egg laid, (2) time to emergence, and (3) size of females. Stator limbatus performed best on its normal host in all three variables measured, while S. pruininus performed best on its normal host in emergence time but showed no difference in percent emergence or female size. We also assessed the impact of the egg parasite Uscana semifumipennis (Trichogrammatidae) on the two species of bruchids when the bruchids occurred in their normal hosts. Uscana attacked both bruchids at the same level (20% of eggs parasitized). Thus, the proximate determinant of locality restricted use of hosts is oviposition behavior, which we suggest relates best to differences in the suitability of hosts for larvae.

AB An analytical model of disturbance and plant population dynamics is developed to explore the optimal life history for a plant within a "shifting mosaic" metapopulation.  The population dynamics consist of short-lived recruitment events followed by longer intervals of thinning.  Plants balance costs and benefits of delayed maturation time that result from cohort thinning, a correlation between maturation time and longevity, and the distribution of recruitment events in space and time.  Two fundamentally different responses to disturbance are explored:  (1) the plant is killed by the disturbance that allows for new recruitment (type A response), and (2) the plant may survive many such disturbances (type B response).  Species maximize either the probability of being reproductively mature at the time of the next recruitment opportunity (type A) or the total number of recruitment opportunities to occur during the period of reproductive maturity (type B).  Predictions of the theory are compared with the actual life histories of trees that occur in different disturbance regimes.
   The costs and benefits associated with delayed maturation from an energy standpoint must be weighed against the probability that a recruitment opportunity (disturbance) will occur at a particular age.  Trees subject to low thinning rates should reach reproductive maturity t1 at t1 almost-equal-to 0.4 x (expected disturbance interval in years).  At high thinning rates, this optimum is t1 almost-equal-to 0.4/(mortality rate per year).  Disturbance probabilities that increase with time since the last disturbance select for maturation times that are greater than these values.  Species that are not killed by disturbances have optimal maturation times that are independent of disturbance frequency.  However, when such species are susceptible as juveniles, optimal maturation time does depend on disturbance frequency.  This optimum maturation time is still greater than it is for the case of a mortality response (type A) to disturbance, but less than the case of no susceptibility period (type B).  Application of the theory to real-world disturbance regimes results in predictions that closely match the life histories of species that actually occur there.  The optimal maturation time for a gap species in temperature North American forests is 30-60 yr, a value that agrees with observed maturation times.  A second test involved fire regimes where two species having very different responses to fire and life histories co-occur, Pinus resinosa and P. banksiana.  The maturation times of these species both match the predicted optima for a species that survives fire (P. resinosa) vs. one that is killed by fire (P. banksiana) subjected to identical fire regimes.  Different modes of dispersal are predicted to have important effects on reproductive potential, but little effect on the optimal maturation time.  Application of the models to these actual cases is consistent with that prediction.  The "intermediate" disturbance frequency is predicted to be that which implies the optimum life history that coincides with the life histories of the greatest number of species.

AB Complex life cycles are characterized by niche shifts at the time of metamorphosis. Current models predict optimal sizes for metamorphosis based on maximizing growth, minimizing mortality, or some balance of these goals. These models predict optimal sizes that are independent of the time of metamorphosis. Reproduction and other major events in the life history of organisms are often constrained to seasons, and the state (e.g., mass) of the organism at that time is related to fitness. Therefore, an organism's state as well as the time that that state is achieved are central variables in these time-constrained life histories.
   We extend earlier theory to include explicit time constraints in three, hypothetical, complex life cycles. Dynamic optimization models are constructed to determine optimal time and mass trajectories for niche shifts. First, we consider the habitat shift at emergence in mayflies, where reproduction terminates a growth period in the first habitat and is constrained to a season. Second, we consider the habitat shift at metamorphosis in amphibians, where reproduction terminates a growth phase in the second habitat and reproduction is constrained to a single point in time. Third, we combine the first two effects to allow an extended period of reproduction in amphibians. Here optimal time and mass trajectories are determined for two niche shifts-the shift from aquatic to terrestrial habitat and the shift from a growth phase to a reproductive phase. We present analytical theory that allows both quantitative and qualitative predictions. Problem constructions and solutions are presented graphically to aid intuition in interpreting our results and extending the framework to other parameter values and other life-history examples.
   The general conclusion is that time constraints on complex life histories lead to optimal sizes for niche shifts that vary with time. In time-constrained life histories, any variation in the state of individuals at some time prior to reproduction will be preserved to some degree at reproduction. Therefore, in time-constrained life histories, we expect optimal switches in habitat use or life history stage to depend not only on state but also on the time that state is achieved.

AB Response surfaces describing the empirical dependence of surface pollen percentages of 13 taxa on three standard climatic variables (mean July temperature, mean January temperature, and mean annual precipitation) in eastern North America were used to infer past climates from palynological data. Inferred climates at 3000-yr intervals from 18 000 years ago to the present, based on six taxa (spruce, birch, northern pines, oak, southern pines, and prairie forbs), were used to generate time series of simulated isopoll maps for these taxa and seven others (hickory, fir, beech, hemlock, elm, alder, and sedge). The simulations captured the essential features of the observed isopoll maps for both sets of taxa, including differences in migration patterns during the past 10000 yr that have previously been attributed to differential migration lag. These results establish that the continental-scale vegetation patterns have responded to continuous changes in climate from the last glacial maximum to the present, with lags less-than-or-equal-to 1500 yr. The inferred climatic changes include seasonality changes consistent with orbitally controlled changes in insolation, and shifts in temperature and moisture gradients that are consistent with modelled climatic interactions of the insolation changes with the shrinking Laurentide ice sheet. These results pose new ecological questions about the processes by which vegetated landscapes approach dynamic equilibrium with their changing environment.

AB We compared nonbreeding finch densities (biomass) with seed abundance in arid and semiarid sites in Kenya, the United States, Brazil, and Argentina. Our objectives were to examine whether densities are limited by food, and whether a given seed abundance results in similar finch densities on different continents. We also wished to estimate the relative roles of food and other biotic factors in determining absolute density, by comparing the observed densities to those that might potentially be achieved on a given food supply. We used data from the finches of the Galapagos Islands as an approximate measure of the food-imposed upper limit to finch density because food there is short, emigration is restricted, and predation is reduced.
   Half the variation in finch densities across sites around the world could be explained by standing seed abundance, strongly suggesting that finches on mainlands are food limited. Densities on different continents were roughly similar when seed supplies were the same, despite the different phylogenetic origins of finches present. Nevertheless, average densities on mainlands were only about one-quarter the densities found on Galapagos islands. Low mainland densities possibly result from competition with other granivores (e.g., rodents and ants). However, mainland finches restrict their foraging to areas of relative safety, where seed densities may be lower than elsewhere, hinting that predation may also reduce densities. We suggest that predation and possibly other biotic factors limit mainland populations jointly with food, and do not simply reduce densities below a point where food is limiting.

AB Resilience of eight laboratory stream ecosystems was evaluated following a 92-d light elimination disturbance. Prior to the disturbance, four treatments (snails/once-through flow, snails/recirculated flow, no snails/once-through flow, no snails/recirculated flow) were imposed on the streams, resulting in systems with different biomass levels, nutrient concentrations, and recycling indices. Based on results from models of ecosystem response to disturbance, we hypothesized a priori that once-through streams would recover more quickly than recirculated streams within each grazing regime and that grazed streams would recover more quickly than ungrazed streams within each flow regime. Our results indicated that once-through streams did have a higher resilience than recirculated streams when snails were absent, but not when snails were present. Indeed, most parameters recovered faster in streams without snails than those with them, irrespective of flow regime, in contrast to our prediction. Despite the faster initial recovery rates in once-through than recirculated streams without snails, final biomass levels were similar between these streams. Measurements of phosphorus recycling indices suggested that higher rates of nutrient recycling near the end of the experiment in recirculated streams compensated for the lower inputs of new nutrients in the incoming water, allowing biomass to reach levels similar to those in once-through streams. Results from this empirical work are consistent with the theory that resilience is positively associated with the rate of nutrient input to a nutrient-limited system, but are inconsistent with the idea that resilience is positively associated with the addition of a herbivore trophic level to the system. Grazing intensity (i.e., density), as well as behavioral (e.g., vagility) and life history characteristics may need to be considered in future models.

AB We examined the influence of timing of reproduction and brood size on growth rates of goslings of nidifugous Lesser Snow Geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) using data collected at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba from 1978 to the present. Gosling growth rates declined significantly during the season, and the declines were independent of the parental genotype. Goslings from larger broods grew significantly faster, but there was no significant annual variation in the seasonal growth rate patterns with either hatch date or brood size. The hatch date and brood size effects could not be accounted for by systematic differences in either egg size or body size of the female parent. Goslings that grew more slowly due to the effects of hatch date or brood size were significantly smaller as adults. Because gosling growth rates influence final adult size, they may have a significant effect on various life history traits in this species.

AB We studied population responses to variation in larval density in a salamander (Ambystoma laterale) that breeds in splash pools on exposed rocky shorelines at Isle Royale, Michigan. Population densities and size distributions were sampled in the field with little error because the water is clear and the pools are kept free of sediment and vegetation by waves from winter storms on Lake Superior. We experimentally manipulated salamander densities in 12 natural pools (three replicates each of four densities) and simultaneously monitored salamander populations in 27 control pools on two islands. The experiment demonstrated that increasing density significantly reduced survival and growth, and increased the skew in the size distributions of individuals. Each of these responses was also observed in the undisturbed natural populations. Density effects were probably due to interference because (1) natural variation in the densities of prey taxa did not influence salamander performance in the experiment, (2) salamander density had no effect on prey availability, and (3) tail damage from attacks by conspecifics was widespread and positively correlated with density. We conclude that density dependence is commonplace in salamander larvae, and probably makes an important contribution to regulating the population size of Ambystoma laterale at Isle Royale.

AB This paper analyses, on an individual plant basis, the various components determining seed production in the evergreen shrub Lavandula latifolia (Labiatae), in order to estimate their relative contributions to individual differences in fecundity. The relationships between fecundity and age, size, and growth rate are also examined. Experimental pollination and watering were done in an attempt to alter natural patterns of partial fecundity components. Fecundity of individual plants is partitioned into its absolute (number of inflorescences, number of flowers per inflorescence) and relative (fruits/flower and seeds/fruit) partial components, and the following questions are addressed:  (1) Are there individual differences in relative components of fecundity? (2) What are the proportional contributions of relative and absolute components of fecundity to individual variation in seed production? (3) Are relative measures of reproductive success reliable predictors of individual differences in fecundity? (4) When induced experimentally, do changes in partial fecundity components translate into modifications of the population's ranking of absolute fecundities?
   Fecundity depended more on plant size than age, was unrelated to growth rate, and was limited by water, but not pollen, availability. Individual plants differed in all components of fecundity examined, and differences were consistent among years. The proportional contributions of the various components to individual differences in fecundity were very unequal. Almost all variation among plants in seed production (almost-equal-to 90% of variance) was explained by the variances and covariances of number of inflorescences and number of flowers per inflorescence. Variation among plants in the two relative components (fruit and seed set), even though statistically significant, had a negligible influence on individual differences in fecundity. These patterns remained invariant despite significant modification of flower production and fruit set induced by artificially watering a part of the study population. Fruit and seed set alone are unreliable indicators of individual differences in the maternal component of fitness in L. latifolia, and a review of relevant literature indicates that this probably applies to other polycarpic plants as well. Plant reproductive biology studies may make erroneous inferences if they consider exclusively data on relative fruit and seed set, and neglect the absolute components of individual differences in fecundity. It is proposed that, to circumvent these potential problems, demographic aspects and absolute estimates of seed output on a per individual basis should be examined in addition to the customarily employed fruit and seed set measures.

AB This study examined temporal and spatial variability in competition as well as the relative importance of competition and natural disturbance to Hydropsyche oslari and Simulium vigatum in a southern California stream.  These two filter-feeding insects dominated the community studied, accounting for 99% of all individuals.  I maintained four field treatments every 2 wk for a year:  (1) removal of Simulium; (2) removal of Hydropsyche; (3) removal of both taxa and subsequent scrubbing of the rock surfaces; and (4) unmanipulated controls.
   Competition from Hydropsyche oslari restricted the spatial distribution of Simulium virgatum in all seasons except late winter in upstream but not in downstream sections of the study site.  Downstream abundance of Simulium was probably limited by food availability, not competition from Hydropsyche.  During the winter, when floods occurred and densities were low, competition between these insects had no significant impact on spatial distributions.  Although competition was seasonally variable, it occurred frequently and was not rare.
   Although disturbance mediated competition, competition was more important in determining the abundance of Simulium in 1983-1984, a drought year.  Disturbance caused a 13% increase, while competition caused a 34% decline in the simuliid population over the year.  It was not possible, however, to rank the importance of competition and disturbance when considering both species together.  The relative importances were taxon specific.  The abilities of Simulium and Hydropsyche to recover quickly after disturbance were inversely related to their ability to withstand competition.  In addition, the interaction between the two factors was extremely important in determining the relative abundance of both taxa through the year.
   Competition and disturbance both played an important role in regulating this community, at times accounting for up to 60% reductions in the numbers of individuals present in the stream.  The relative importance of competition and disturbance in Refugio Creek should vary from year to year depending on the timing and intensity of winter storms.

By measuring overgrowth patterns for the two most abundant tidepool species of crustoe coralline algae (Lithophyllum impressum and Pseudolithophyllum whidbeyense) in the San Juan Island of Washington State, we documented a reversal in competitive dominance that occurs at about the + 1 m level; L. impressum wins in upper zones and P. whidbeyense in lower zones. Regardless of tidepool elevation or species, thicker crusts overgrow thinner ones and crusts of equal thickness are competitively equal.
   Both crust species are grazed by limpets (primarily Lottia pelta and Tectura scutum), which are the dominant herbivores in tidepools. Laboratory experiments show that limpet grazing can reduce crust thickness. Laboratory and field analyses of limpet grazing indicate that corallines in tidepools in the upper intertidal zone are subject to high frequency (bite rate per unit area) and low intensity (penetration depth per bite) limpet grazing, whereas those in low tidepools are subjected to opposite grazing characteristics. L. impressum is a thick crust, which has a multicellular covering over its meristem. This covering protects the growing portion of the plant from the frequent, low-intensity herbivory that occurs in the higher tidepools. In contrast, P. whidbeyense lacks a multilayered epithallus and is more susceptible to injury in high tidepools. In low pools, meristems of both crusts are injured. L. impressum heals these deep wounds by regenerating vertically, but the net result is a thinner plant that is easily overgrown. P. whidbeyense dominates the low zone because it is capable of much more rapid lateral growth including over its own deep wounds; the crust overgrows itself, thereby developing a thicker thallus and improving its competitive success over L. impressum.
   We suggest that a continuum of defensive and regenerative characteristics exists among organisms; the adaptive nature of these depends on the levels of production and the frequency and intensity of disturbance in their environment. It is evident that herbivory is important in this system, not by the traditional mechanism of releasing limiting resources (e.g., primary space), but by mediating competitive abilities through the relative susceptibility to, and recovery from, herbivore-induced disturbance.

AB Little is known about factors that control nutrients loss from plants.  We measured N (nitrogen) and P (phosphorus) resorption from leaves of Alaskan birch (Betula papyrifera) trees that differed strongly in their tissue nutrient status.  We then experimentally manipulated those factors that we thought were most likely to control nutrient resorption.  Trees of high nutrient status had larger maximum leaf N and P pools, translocated more N and P out of leaves, and left larger N and P pools in abscised leaves than did trees on infertile soils.  However, plant nutrient status had no effect on the efficiency of N or P resorption (i.e., the proportion of the maximum nutrient pool resorbed from leaves during autumn senescence) except for low efficiency of P resorption in the highly fertile lawn.  Prolonging the time that a leaf remained attached to the tree had no effect on N and P resorption efficiency.  Leaching by autumn rains accounted for 25% of the N disapperance and 55% of the P disappearance from senescing leaves in a high-fertility field. Weakening of source-sink interactions by shading senescing leaves or by removing catkins (a sink for carbohydrates and nutrients) significantly reduced resorption efficiency.  On the basis of our results and previous work, we conclude that nutrient resorption efficiency is influenced more strongly by carbohydrate flux from leaves (i.e., source-sink interactions) than by factors governing hydrolysis of nutrient-containing fractions in leaves.

AB Population ecologists have devoted disproportionate attention to the estimation and study of birth and death rates and far less effort to rates of movement.  Movement and fidelity to wintering areas have important ecological and evolutionary implications for avian populations.  Previous inferences about movement among and fidelity to wintering areas have been restricted by limitations of data and methodology.  We use multiple observation data from a large-scale capture-resighting study of Canada Geese in the Atlantic flyway to estimate probabilities of returning to previous wintering locations and moving to new locations.  Mark-resight data from 28 849 Canada Geese (Branta canadensis) banded with individually coded neck bands in the mid-Atlantic (New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey), Chesapeake (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia), and Carolinas (North and South Carolina) were used to estimate movement and site fidelity.  Two three-sample mark-resight models were developed and programmed using SURVIV to estimate the probability of moving among or remaining within these three wintering regions.  The model (MV2) that incorporated "tradition" or memory of previous wintering regions fit the data better than the model (MV1) that assumes that a first-order Markov chain described movement among regions.  Considerable levels of movement occurred among regions of the Atlantic flyway.  The annual probability of remaining in the same region for two successive winters, used as a measure of site fidelity, was 0.710 +/- 0.016 (estimated mean +/- SE [SE], 0.889 +/- 0.006, and 0.562 +/- 0.025, for the mid-Atlantic, Chesapeake, and Carolinas, respectively.  The estimated probability of moving to the Chesapeake from the mid-Atlantic or from the Carolinas was 3 x and 25 x as high, respectively, as the probability of moving in the opposite directions.  Changes in estimated probabilities of moving between years corresponded to changes in winter harshness.  In warm years, geese moved north and in cold years, they moved south.  Geese had a high probability of moving to and remaining in the Chesapeake.  Annual changes in the movement probabilities did not correspond to annual changes in the United States Fish and Wildlife Service midwinter survey.  Considerable numbers of geese from the Carolinas appeared to be wintering in more northerly locations ("short-stopped") in subsequent winters.

AB Pollen and plant macrofossil data from six sites along an elevational gradient (661-1320 m) in the east-central Adirondack Mountains (New York) reveal the history of six tree taxa (Picea, Abies, Pinus strobus, Tsuga, Betula papyrifera, B. lutea) in the region during the past 10000 yr. Space-time plots of the data show how spatial patterns of vegetation along the elevational gradient changed during the Holocene in response to climatic, biotic, and other changes. The plots also illustrate the contrasting spatial scales at which pollen and plant macrofossil data sense forest composition.
   Vegetational patterns along the gradient changed substantially during the Holocene. Responses of the six tree taxa to temporal changes in environment were individualistic, resulting in continual changes in the spatial vegetation patterns. The modern elevational zonation developed only within the past 3000 yr.
   Each tree taxon had a unique abundance pattern along the spatial and temporal gradients. Pollen percentages of Picea, Pinus, Tsuga, and Betula did not vary systematically with elevation, but changed substantially with time, indicating changes in abundance of these taxa at a regional scale. Macrofossil percentages of all six taxa varied with both time and elevation, revealing temporal changes in abundance of these taxa along the elevational gradient. Abies populations were concentrated at higher elevations, while Pinus strobus, Tsuga, and Betula lutea trees were most abundant at lower elevations. The elevational distributions and low-elevation abundance of the latter three taxa changed substantially during the Holocene. Picea trees were rare at all elevations during the early and mid-Holocene, and increased in abundance at mid-elevation sites within the past 3000 yr.

AB Many species of zooplankton display temporal changes in the size of the offspring they produce.  We address the question, is offspring size variation by Daphnia a predictable response to changes in resource abundance?  For each of two species of Daphnia (D. pulicaria and D. pulex), we raised several distinct genotypes at each of three different food levels.  Differences in neonate body length, dry mass, and C:N ratio were measured at each food level.
   The two species responded differently to food level; neonate mass decreased in D. pulex with decreasing food, but the largest (mass) D. pulicaria neonates were produced at the intermediate food level.  For both species, the lightest (mass) neonates were produced at the lowest food, but these neonates were often equal (D. pulex), or longer (D. pulicaria) in body length than those produced at high food.  The production of small-mass, but relatively large-length neonates in the lowest food level was associated with a lower C:N ratio of both adults and neonates compared with the higher food levels.  We conclude that qualitative changes in the production of offspring can result from simple quantitative changes in resource abundance.  We suggest that these responses may represent adaptive plasticity in reproduction.

TI ZONATION OF SPARTINA-PATENS AND SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA IN A NEW-ENGLAND

AB In New England salt marshes the boundary between frequently flooded low marsh habitats and less frequently flooded high marsh habitats is characterized by striking plant zonation.  Spartina alterniflora monocultures dominate low marsh habitats while the seaward border of high marsh habitats is generally dominated by Spartina patens.  In this paper I examine the role of interspecific competition in maintaining this zonation pattern.
   Spartina patens turfs and tillers transplanted into the low marsh were severely stunted with or without S. alterniflora neighbors, and low marsh bare patches bordering S. patens monocultures were not significantly colonized by S. patens in three growing seasons.  The limited ability of S. patens to oxygenate its rhizosphere in anoxic soils appears to limit S. patens to high marsh habitats.
   In contrast, S. alterniflora transplants grew vigorously in the high and low marsh when buffered from neighbors, but were excluded from the high marsh in 2-3 yr when S. patens was present.  S. alterniflora also rapidly invaded the high marsh in the absence of S. patens.  These results support the hypothesis that S. alterniflora is restricted to low marsh habitats by competitive displacement.  S. alterniflora thrives in anoxic low marsh habitats due to its ability to oxygenate its roots and rhizosphere.  Rhizosphere oxidation by S. alterniflora, however, is not evident in seedlings and small colonizing patches and both seedlings and small colonizing patches of S. alterniflora are stunted in anoxic low marsh substrates.  This suggests that the success of S. alterniflora in anoxic habitats is size dependent and may be driven by group benefits of rhizosphere oxidation.
   These results suggest that the maintenance of intertidal zonation in rocky beach and marsh plant communities is very similar.  In both assemblages, competitive dominants monopolize physically benign habitats and displace competitive subordinates to physically stressful habitats.

AB Spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis Kirby) outbreaks are important disturbances engelmannii), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) in the southern Rocky Mountains.  However, little is known about the influences of these outbreaks on overall forest dynamics.  We used age-structure analyses and dendrochronological techniques to investigate the effects of a major spruce beetle outbreak on stand composition, dominance, tree age and size structures, radial growth, and succession in subalpine forests in Colorado.  This outbreak, which occurred in the 1940s, caused a shift in dominance from spruce to fir and a reduction in average and maximum tree diameters, heights, and ages.  The outbreak did not favor new seedling establishment of the seral lodgepole pine.  Thus, in seral stands spruce beetle outbreak accelerates succession towards the shade-tolerant tree species.
   The predominant response to the outbreak was the release of previously suppressed small-diameter spruce (not attacked by the beetle) and subalpine fir (a non-host species).  Following the 1940s outbreak, growth rates of released trees, remained high for > 40 yr.  The relative increases in growth rates were similar for both species.  Both spruce and fir will continue to codominate the affected stands.  The predominance of accelerated growth following a spruce beetle outbreak, instead of new seedling establishment, is a major contrast to the pattern of stand development following fire.  In some Colorado subalpine forests the effects of disturbance by spruce beetle outbreaks appear to be as great as those due to fire.
