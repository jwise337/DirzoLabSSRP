AB We propose an index to measure the relative interaction intensity in plants (RII) with strong mathematical and statistical properties which overcome problems shown by other frequently used indices. RII has defined limits [-1, +1]; is symmetrical around zero, with identical absolute values for competition and facilitation; is linear; and does not have discontinuities in its range. It is therefore safe to use in statistical and mathematical operations. RII distribution is approximately normal, with means equal to the true population index and a sampling variance that can be derived. Its strong statistical properties make RII proper for use in parametric meta-analyses. It can be applied to any kind of interaction (from competitive exclusion to symbiosis) and in commonly published ranges of interaction intensity it offers the most consistent results. Because RII uses basic arithmetical operators, it can be scaled up and used to measure multispecific interactions at the community level.

AB A series of spatially nested assemblages of Rhytidoponera operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (Formicidae: Hymenoptera) from Sturt National Park, New South Wales, Australia, were examined for patterns of dispersion in multivariate morphological space. Morphological overdispersion within an assemblage, relative to a null model, is hypothesized to be a result of the structuring influence of interspecific competition. We compared up to 45 observed assemblages, from across multiple spatial scales, to two null models. Meta-analysis of the null model analyses indicated a general trend to morphological overdispersion, particularly so at restricted scales. Larger scale assemblages were overdispersed relative to only one of the two null models, which we tentatively interpret as being indicative of different competition-driven mechanisms operating at different spatial scales. We also demonstrate that the observed assemblages represent a larger number of species groups than expected by chance, and that this pattern of phylogenetic overdispersion is closely related to the observed morphological patterns.

AB Many studies of pond-breeding amphibians involve sampling individuals during migration to and from breeding habitats. Interpreting population processes and dynamics from these studies is difficult because (1) only a proportion of the population is observable each season, while an unknown proportion remains unobservable (e.g., nonbreeding adults) and (2) not all observable animals are captured. Imperfect capture probability can be easily accommodated in capture-recapture models, but temporary transitions between observable and unobservable states, often referred to as temporary emigration, is known to cause problems in both open- and closed-population models.
   We develop a multistate mark-recapture (MSMR) model, using an open-robust design that permits one entry and one exit from the study area per season. Our method extends previous temporary emigration models (MSMR with an unobservable state) in two ways. First, we relax the assumption of demographic closure (no mortality) between consecutive (secondary) samples, allowing estimation of within-pond survival. Also, we add the flexibility to express survival probability of unobservable individuals (e.g., "non-breeders") as a function of the survival probability of observable animals while in the same, terrestrial habitat. This allows for potentially different annual survival probabilities for observable and unobservable animals.
   We apply our model to a relictual population of eastern tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum tigrinum). Despite small sample sizes, demographic parameters were estimated with reasonable precision. We tested several a priori biological hypotheses and found evidence for seasonal differences in pond survival. Our methods could be applied to a variety of pond-breeding species and other taxa where individuals are captured entering or exiting a common area (e.g., spawning or roosting area, hibernacula).

AB The loss of a species from an ecological community can set up a cascade of secondary extinctions that in the worst case could lead to the collapse of the community. Both deterministic and stochastic mechanisms may be involved in such secondary extinctions. To investigate the extent of secondary extinctions in ecological communities following the loss of a species, we here develop a community viability analysis. We introduce a measure called the "quasi-collapse risk" that is defined as the probability that the number of species in a community falls below some defined value within a fixed period of time following the loss of a species. We develop deterministic and stochastic methods for finding post-extinction communities. We use these methods to investigate the relationship between diversity (species richness) and quasi-collapse risks in model communities. It is shown that, in a deterministic context, communities with more species within trophic levels have a larger fraction of species remaining in post-extinction communities. This benefit of species richness is to a large extent lost in the presence of demographic stochasticity. The reason for this is a negative relationship between population density and species diversity. We also show that communities become increasingly triangular in shape as secondary extinctions take place, due to greater extinction risk of species at higher trophic levels. We argue that this new approach holds some promise for identifying fragile ecosystems and keystone species.

AB Landscape change has great, yet infrequently measured, potential to influence the susceptibility of natural systems to invasive species impacts. We quantified attack by an invasive biological control weevil (Rhinocyllus conicus) on native thistles in relation to two types of landscape change: agricultural intensification and invasion by an exotic thistle, Carduus nutans, the original target of biological control. Weevil egg load was measured on native thistles in three landscape types: (1) agriculture dominated, (2) grassland dominated with exotic thistles, and, (3) grassland dominated without exotic thistles. We found no difference in egg load on native thistles within grassland landscapes without exotic thistles vs. within agricultural landscapes, suggesting that agricultural intensification per se does not influence levels of weevil attack. However, attack on the native Cirsium undulatum increased significantly (three- to fivefold) with increasing exotic thistle density. Within-patch exotic thistle density explained >50% of the variation in both the intensity and frequency of weevil attack. Since R. conicus feeding dramatically reduces seed production, exotic thistles likely exert a negative indirect effect on native thistles. This study provides some of the first empirical evidence that invasion by an exotic plant can increase attack of native plants by shared insect herbivores.

AB Sediments from lakes in the northeastern United States ("New England") document climatic changes over the past 15 000 years that may, in turn, explain the long-term history of regional forest development. A rise in New England temperatures similar to14 600 yr BP (calendar years before present) coincided with the initial increase in spruce (Picea spp.) populations after deglaciation. Later temperature fluctuations correlated with changes in spruce forest composition until 11600 yr BP, when evidence for a shift to warm, dry conditions agrees with the replacement of spruce by pine (Pinus spp.) populations. Raised lake levels indicate increased moisture availability by 8200 yr BP when mesic hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) and beech (Fagus grandifolia) populations replaced the dry-tolerant pines. Cooler-than-modern temperatures, however, persisted until 6000 yr BP and appear to have limited the expansion of hickory (Carya spp.) populations. Similarly, moisture-dependent chestnut (Castanea dentata) populations did not increase until similar to3000 yr BP, when moisture availability rose to modern levels. Pathogens played a key role in a dramatic decline in hemlock populations around 5400 yr BP, but the decline also corresponds with low lake levels indicating that moisture availability may have been a factor in the decline and recovery. Our analysis, therefore, demonstrates that changes in both the abundance of existing taxa and the arrival of new taxa closely correlate with independently documented changes in climate. Temperature trends do not explain all aspects of the vegetation history, but when both temperature and moisture balance are considered, we see that forest composition consistently changed within centuries or less of climatic changes.

AB We report on the foraging behavior of three small-mammal species over 2 1/2 years using experimental foraging trays. Trays provisioned with oat seed were set out in the field at dawn and dusk, and the amount of seed consumed (with re-provisioning) was determined over three consecutive nights and days. Experiments simultaneously evaluated the role of lunar phase, season, and microhabitat (shrub vs. open); additionally, artificial exclosures (similar to0.56 ha) were employed to evaluate the influence both of mammalian and avian predators and of a dominant competitor species, the large diurnal degu (Octodon degus). Other principal small mammals included Darwin's leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini) and the olive field mouse (Akodon olivaceus). Trays were enclosed by hardware-cloth cages with either small or large holes in the side to exclude avian consumers and provide selective access to all small mammals (large holes) or to exclude the largest species (small holes). Small-mammal population sizes varied greatly throughout the study. Principal factors affecting seed consumption rates were population size, followed by season (winter > summer), and microhabitat (shrub > open). The role of the latter factors was relatively minor in 1999 and 2000 but amplified greatly in the final year of study when small-mammal numbers increased five-fold. In contrast to earlier work at this site, predation had minimal direct effects on foraging activities, although significant effects of microhabitat, lunar phase, and season suggest the importance of perceived predator risk. Both Phyllotis and Akodon foraged more in the absence of degus, and two- and three-way interactions further supported an important role for competition in this system. The combination of large-scale predator/ competitor manipulations with fine-scale foraging experiments and long-term replication illustrates the importance of utilizing such approaches to gain insights to behavior and foraging strategies in variable environments.

AB Flooding affects the abundance and distribution of plant species worldwide. Many plants are damaged or even killed by flooding events, due to the associated oxygen deprivation in cells. Stimulated shoot elongation is an important adaptive mode that can restore contact of leaves with the atmosphere above the water surface. This strongly improves inward diffusion of oxygen and the rate of photosynthesis. Fast elongation of submerged petioles of the model plant Rumex palustris involves the integrated action of the plant hormones ethylene, auxin, gibberellin, and abscisic acid. The closely related Rumex acetosa is unable to switch on petiole elongation when submerged. In a comparative study of these two Rumex species, we found that the response to the gaseous phytohormone ethylene, which accumulates in plant tissues during submergence, explains their contrasting elongation behavior. In order to study the importance of this shoot elongation response in the distributional patterns of plants in natural floodplains, we quantified the ethylene-induced elongation response of 22 plant species occurring in the Rhine River floodplain. These results were compared with the results of a multivariate analysis based on 84 vegetation surveys performed in the same area. The species compositions of the surveys were grouped along two environmental gradients: flooding duration and soil dehydration after the floodwater subsided. If we superimpose the ethylene-induced elongation capacity on these vegetation data, it becomes clear that the capacity to elongate upon exposure to ethylene positively correlates with flooding duration and negatively with soil dehydration. Based on this analysis, we conclude that the capacity to elongate is an important selective trait in field distribution patterns of plants in flood-prone environments. Fast shoot elongation under water seems to be a favorable trait only in environments with shallow and prolonged flooding events, while costs associated with this response prevent its expression in sites with deep floods, sites with floods short in duration, or in sites in which flood water recedes rapidly. The approach outlined in this paper may be more widely applicable in ecological studies that aim to understand the functional relationship between plant traits and species distributions along environmental gradients.

AB Large body size, carnivory, and endothermic costs lead to exceptionally high caloric demands in many mammalian predators. The potential impact oil prey resources may be marked but is difficult to demonstrate because of the mobility, sparseness, and cryptic nature of these animals. In this study, we developed a method based on comparative bioenergetics and demographic modeling to evaluate predator effects and then used this approach to assess the potential impact of killer whales on sea otter and Steller sea lion populations in the Aleutian Islands. Daily caloric requirements of killer whales determined from allometric regressions for field metabolic rate show that all adult killer whale requires 51-59 kcal(.)kg (1.)d(-1) (2.5-2.9 W/kg). Caloric values of prey items determined by bomb calorimetry ranged from 41 630 kcal for all adult female sea otter to sequentially higher values for male otters. sea lion pups. and adult Steller sea lions. Integrating these results with demographic changes in marine mammal populations show that fewer than 40 killer whales Could have caused the recent Steller sea lion decline in the Aleutian archipelago; a pod of five individuals could account for the decline in sea otters and the continued Suppression of sea lions. The collapse of the historical prey base of killer whales due to human whaling may have contributed to a sequential dietary switch from high to low caloric value prey. thereby initiating these declines. This study demonstrates that a combined physiological-demographic approach increases Our ability to critically evaluate the potential impact of a predator oil community structure and enables us to define underlying mechanisms that drive or constrain top-down forcing in dynamic ecosystems.

AB Spatial structures may not only result from ecological interactions, they may also play an essential functional role in organizing the interactions. Modeling spatial patterns at multiple spatial and temporal scales is thus a crucial step to understand the functioning of ecological communities. PCNM (principal coordinates of neighbor matrices) analysis achieves a spectral decomposition of the spatial relationships among the sampling sites, creating variables that correspond to all the spatial scales that can be perceived in a given data set. The analysis then finds the scales to which a data table of interest responds. The significant PCNM variables can be directly interpreted in terms of spatial scales, or included in a procedure of variation decomposition with respect to spatial and environmental components. This paper presents four applications of PCNM analysis to ecological data representing combinations of: transect or surface data, regular or irregular sampling schemes, univariate or multivariate data. The data sets include Amazonian ferns, tropical marine zooplankton, chlorophyll in a marine lagoon, and oribatid mites in a peat bog.

AB Studies of the relationship between the composition of nectar and its consumers often focus on single or very few species, thus ignoring dynamics in diverse assemblages. Conversely, most documented patterns of nectarivore communities have not been linked to nectar quality measures. In a study of nectar-foraging ant communities in an Australian rain forest, we found that nectar source partitioning between consumers may be driven by two factors: (1) variation in nectar composition preferences mediated by taste and physiological requirements, and (2) severe asymmetrical competitive interactions within the community. Ant communities are strongly shaped by competitive hierarchies. When foraging for extrafloral and floral nectar sources, wound sap, and homopteran honeydew, competitively superior weaver-ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) showed a significant preference for nectar composition, whereas most other common community members were nonselective. Nectars frequently used by O. smaragdina were characterized by similar amino acid profiles and higher sugar and amino acid concentration. We hypothesize that, for nectar-consumer relationships, as for other interactions in complex communities, the interplay between species-specific physiological optima and context-dependent asymmetrical competition is essential to explain consumers' preferences and the dynamics of the system.

AB Characteristics used to group species, and thus generalize ecological interactions, can aid in constructing predictive models in species-rich food webs. We tested whether size could be used to predict a behavioral response of multiple prey species (n > 50) to exclusion of large-bodied fishes, including seven abundant piscivore species, in a lowland Neotropical river. A randomized block design (n = 6) included three experimental treatments constructed on sandbank habitats: large fish exclusion, cage control (barrier with gaps), and natural reference plot (no barrier). Exclosures prevented passage of all large-bodied fishes, but the mesh size allowed passage of prey fishes. After two weeks, experimental areas were sampled once during the day and once at night. Total abundance of prey fishes was not significantly different among treatments, and effects on species density were variable. Analyses based on fish size class, however, demonstrated significant size-based effects of large-fish exclusion. Abundance of medium fishes (40-110 mm) in exclusion treatments increased significantly relative to controls in day (248%) and night (91%) samples, and this trend was apparent for many species (n > 13). Species density of medium fishes increased significantly in exclusion treatments. There was evidence of an intraspecific, size-dependent response for the three most common species. Ninety percent of prey in stomach contents of seven common large-bodied piscivores (collected from river sandbanks) were 40-110 mm, corresponding to size of fishes that responded to large-fish exclusion.. Behavioral responses of medium prey likely resulted from exclusion of these large-bodied piscivores. These results extend size-based predator avoidance behavior demonstrated in temperate systems to a highly connected tropical river food web. In this species-rich web, size is a strong predictor of behavioral responses of multiple prey species to large piscivores, and it can be used to generalize outcomes of multiple species interacting simultaneously.

AB I use age ratios of males (1) to examine latitudinal and longitudinal variation in survival in Hermit and Townsend's Warblers, both Neotropical migrants, (2) to show that the estimates for male survival are significantly lower for Townsend's Warblers than for Hermit Warblers, and (3) to show that despotic territorial behavior forces yearling males into high-elevation habitats for their first potential breeding season. When breeding dispersal is high, as is the case in these warblers, recapture methods will always underestimate survival because permanent emigration cannot be distinguished from mortality, even after accounting for detection probabilities of less than 1. Reliable survival estimates are important to life history analyses and conservation planning; thus, range-wide measures of the proportion of adults may be the best approach to estimating survival for birds with high breeding dispersal. Similarly, landscape-level consequences of despotic territorial behavior have been difficult to explore except by examining age ratios across geography.

   RESPONSES
AB Dynamic defense responses plants exhibit when attacked by insects are probably as important ecologically as constitutive defenses were once thought to be. Plants recognize and respond to interspecific differences among insects and microbes, and some insects appear to manipulate plant signaling and response systems. These interactions are based on an exchange of signals among plant, insect, and microbes. Many of these signals are hormones, and a surprising number are common to both kingdoms. Fatty-acid-based hormones provide a particularly good example, and preliminary data suggesting that plant defense responses can be mediated by common insect hormones and signals (prostaglandins) are presented. The evolutionary and ecological implications of shared signals and signal-stealing are diverse and can greatly improve our understanding of plant-pest interactions.

AB Many animals lack obvious sexual dimorphism. making assignment of sex difficult even for observed or captured animals. For many such species it is possible to assign sex with certainty only at some occasions, for example, when they exhibit certain types of behavior. A common approach to handling this situation in capture-recapture Studies has been to group capture histories into those of animals eventually identified as male and female and those For which sex was never known. Because group membership is dependent on the number of occasions at which an animal was caught or observed (known sex animals, on average, will have been observed at more occasions than unknown-sex animals), survival estimates for known-sex animals will he positively biased, and those for unknown aninials will be negatively biased. In this paper. we develop capture-recapture models that incorporate sex ratio and sex assignment parameters that permit unbiased estimation in the face of this sampling problem. We demonstrate the magnitude of bias in the traditional capture-recapture approach to this sampling problem, and we explore properties of estimators from other ad hoc approaches. The model is then applied to capture-recapture data for adult Roseate Terns (Sterna dougallii) at Falkner Island, Connecticut, 1993-2002. Sex ratio among adults ill this population favors females, and we tested the hypothesis that this population showed sex-specific differences in adult survival. Evidence was provided for higher survival of adult females than males, as predicted. We recommend use of this modeling approach for future capture-recapture studies in which sex cannot always be assigned to captured or observed animals. We also place this problem in the more general Context Of uncertainty in state classification ill multistate capture-recapture model.

AB We present a framework for fitting multiple random walks to animal movement paths consisting of ordered sets of step lengths and turning angles. Each step and turn is assigned to one of a number of random walks, each characteristic of a different behavioral state. Behavioral state assignments may be inferred purely from movement data or may include the habitat type in which the animals are located. Switching between different behavioral states may be modeled explicitly using a state transition matrix estimated directly from data, or switching probabilities may take into account the proximity of animals to landscape features. Model fitting is undertaken within a Bayesian framework using the WinBUGS software. These methods allow for identification of different movement states using several properties of observed paths and lead naturally to the formulation of movement models. Analysis of relocation data from elk released in east-central Ontario, Canada, suggests it biphasic movement behavior: elk are either in an "encamped" state in which step lengths are small and turning angles are high, or in an "exploratory" state, in which daily step lengths are several kilometers and turning angles are small. Animals encamp in open habitat (agricultural fields and opened forest), but the exploratory state is not associated with any particular habitat type.

AB Areas of high plant diversity, known as forb pannes, characterize many northern New England salt marshes. These pannes are physically harsh habitats where stress-tolerant forbs escape the competitively dominant clonal turfs. In this paper, we experimentally examine the hypothesis that soil waterlogging maintains forb pannes.
   Experimentally draining pannes led to the replacement of typical panne vegetation by Spartina patens. After four years, S. patens cover increased by greater than 300% in the drained plots, while in adjacent, unmanipulated controls, its cover remained unchanged. In a second experiment, forb panne elevation was manipulated to either increase or decrease soil drainage. After three years elevated plots were dominated by S. patens, whereas lowered plots were dominated by Spartina alterniflora, with reduced forb densities.
   Our results demonstrate that forb panne communities are the consequence of poor drainage and waterlogged soils that limit the success of competitively dominant clonal turfs and permit the persistence of panne forbs. These results imply that the extensive ditching of New England salt marshes over the past three centuries to increase the value of marshes for livestock grazing, development, and mosquito control has likely eradicated most of these forb panne habitats.

AB We studied the mechanisms that regulate colony dynamics in a Spanish population of Lesser Kestrels, using eight years of data from banded individuals in 494 colony-years. Colony growth was positively related to breeding success at the colony the year before. However, individuals of all dispersal statuses, i.e., adult and first-breeding philopatric and immigrant birds, significantly contributed to changes in colony size, indicating an important effect of dispersal on colony dynamics via colony quality. Given that there is strong evidence that Lesser Kestrels base their settlement decisions on conspecifics, we tested whether immigrants used the number of previously settled residents in year t (social or conspecific attraction hypothesis) and/or the breeding performance of conspecifics in year t - 1 (performance-based attraction hypothesis) to select their breeding colony. Breeding success of colonies varied both in space and time and was autocorrelated from one year to the next. Moreover, lifetime reproductive success of Lesser Kestrels was positively associated with colony size, and individuals can predict final colony size early in the breeding season, so assumptions of both hypotheses were fulfilled. Our results support the social attraction hypothesis, since immigration was positively related to the number of philopatric adults, but not to conspecific breeding success the year before. Given that departure decisions of adults were based on personal information about breeding success and colony size is related to fitness prospects, previously settled individuals provide easy and reliable information about colony quality, and social attraction could be seen as a particular case of public information in Lesser Kestrels. Consistently, absolute numbers of both philopatric adults and immigrants increased with colony size the year before, although immigrants increased only up to a threshold beyond which this trend disappeared. Therefore, immigrants seem to be prevented from settling in the largest colonies, which could explain why all individuals do not concentrate in a few big colonies, but some settle in suboptimal colonies or colonize unoccupied sites. This opposing effect of conspecifics, together with the low levels of temporal autocorrelation in colony quality between time lags greater than or equal to2 yr, could promote colony size variability and facultative coloniality in this species.

AB Research on the subfossil record and paleoecology of Olea europaea suggests a new interpretation of its history and ecology with reference to the Mediterranean climate since the Neogene. New results are based on the wood anatomy of ancient and extant Olea and a model estimating hydraulic conductance established for wild forms belonging to Olea europaea subsp. europaea. These suggest that during glacial periods wild olive populations survived in protected microenvironments, particularly riparian habitats. Thereafter, the post-glacial expansion of olive associated with climatic warming took place from these refuge areas. This new evidence suggests that the continued existence of Olea in Mediterranean areas since the Neogene was made possible either by preferential survival of Olea lineages adaptable to the Holocene climate or from enhanced adaptation to extreme environmental variation, a trait possibly originating from Tertiary predecessors and maintained in post-glacial olive populations.

AB The relative importance of food quality vs. enemy-free space remains an unresolved but central issue in the evolutionary ecology of host use by phytophagous insects. In this study, we investigate their relative importance in determining host-plant use by a generalist caterpillar, Estigmene acrea (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae). In nature, E. acrea late-instar caterpillars preferred Senecio longilobus (Asteraceae), which contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids that the caterpillars sequester, over Viguiera dentata (Asteraceae), a natal host, and typically suffered a 28% mortality risk from parasitoids. We hypothesized that the natural, mixed diet of caterpillars provides high-quality food via hosts like Viguiera as well as antiparasitoid defense via sequestered toxins from Senecio. We found that a pure Viguiera diet provides superior growth performance over a pure Senecio or mixed diet in the absence of parasitism. However, when parasitism risk is at least moderate, the mixed diet provides a survival advantage over the pure diets of Viguiera or Senecio. We therefore conclude that the balance between benefits of growth (food quality) and defense (enemy-free space) maintains the use of a mixed diet in nature. Furthermore, the value of enemy-free space supercedes the value of food quality in determining the host-plant preference of late-instar caterpillars.

AB Ecological stoichiometry provides a novel context for elucidating the occurrence of intraguild predation. Recent data show that predators on average have a higher nitrogen content and lower C:N ratio than potential herbivorous prey. Thus, many predators may be nitrogen limited, and intraguild predation may allow them to increase their nitrogen intake and growth by supplementing a diet of herbivores with more nitrogen-rich intraguild prey. We tested this hypothesis using an assemblage of salt-marsh-inhabiting arthropods. First, we determined the nitrogen content and C:N ratio of taxa in four trophic groups (plants, herbivores, omnivores, and predators). Second, we fed an intraguild predator, the wolf spider Pardosa, one of three diets (herbivores, intraguild prey, or an alternating mix of the two) and measured spider Survival, growth, capture rate, and biomass and nitrogen intake.
   In general, body nitrogen content increased and C:N ratio decreased from lower to higher trophic levels for marsh-inhabiting species, with predators having a higher nitrogen content and lower C:N ratio than herbivores. Performance experiments showed that in one case Pardosa ingested more biomass and nitrogen and grew faster on a diet of intraguild prey (the planthopper egg predator Tytthus) than on a diet of herbivores (the planthopper Prokelisia dolus). This occurred because Pardosa captured more Tytthus than Prokelisia and not because Tytthus (a stoichiometric exception) was higher in nitrogen content. In another case, Pardosa grew slower on a diet of intraguild prey (the web-building spider Grammonota) than on a planthopper diet even though Grammonota was more nitrogen rich, a result we attribute to prey behavior and risk of predation. Mass gain and nitrogen intake in Pardosa were highly correlated with the biomass of prey consumed, However, after accounting for the biomass of prey consumed across all diet treatments, we found little evidence that either the nitrogen content or C:N stoichiometry of prey contributed to Pardosa's growth. Thus, there was little support for the hypothesis that the nitrogen stoichiometry of prey directly confers a performance advantage to Pardosa and in itself promotes intraguild predation. In this system, characteristics other than the nitrogen stoichiometry of prey play a significant role in prey capture and predator performance. Nonetheless, by supplementing their diet with readily captured intraguild prey, predators such as Pardosa can increase their nitrogen intake and performance.

AB Because populations of territorial birds are relatively stable compared to those of other animal taxa, they are often considered to be tightly regulated. However, the mechanisms that produce density-dependent feedbacks on demographic rates and thus regulate these populations are poorly understood, particularly for migratory species. We conducted a three-year density-reduction experiment to investigate the behavioral mechanisms that regulate the abundance of a Nearctic-Neotropical migrant passerine, the Black-throated Blue Warbler (Dendroica caerulescens), during the breeding season. We found that the number of young fledged per territory, territory size, and the proportion of time mates spent foraging were significantly greater on territories around which neighbor density was experimentally reduced compared to control territories. Territory quality, proportion of nests depredated per territory, and male countersinging rates were not statistically different between treatments. These results indicate that individuals with more neighbors (i.e., in neighborhoods with greater conspecific density) have reduced breeding productivity. The results also suggest that a crowding mechanism that mediates interactions among territory-holders could generate the density dependence needed to regulate local abundance, at least in areas of homogeneous, high-quality habitat. The effect of the neighbor-density reduction on warbler fecundity and behavior varied with annual fluctuations in weather and food availability, and was strongest in 1997, an El Nino year, when conditions for breeding were least favorable. This variation in our experimental results among years implies that density dependence due to crowding may have its strongest impact on local abundance when environmental conditions are relatively poor.

AB Serotiny is a key life history trait in fire-prone habitats that is favored in plants that experience stand-replacing fires within their average life span. Although variation in fire frequency has been the focus of most studies attempting to understand variation in serotiny among populations and species of plants, other factors can select against serotiny. One agent in particular that can select against serotiny is an efficient pre-dispersal seed predator that eats a large fraction of the seeds held in the canopy. To test whether selection by such a predator selects against scrutiny, we compared levels of serotiny in fire-adapted Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta ssp. latifolia) in five ranges lacking its dominant pre-dispersal seed predator, the pine squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) to 344 stands with pine squirrels. Where pine squirrels were absent, the frequency of serotiny was consistently near 100%, whereas where squirrels were present, the frequency was variable, rarely approached the high levels found in areas without squirrels, and averaged much less than 50%. This indicates that squirrels select against serotiny and that, in the absence of squirrels, the frequency of serotiny would probably be uniformly higher throughout much of the Rocky Mountains. Because serotiny levels also influence the density of seedlings following a fire, squirrels, by selecting strongly against scrutiny, have the potential to alter the early stages and perhaps the course of succession and various community attributes.

AB Mussel beds and algal canopies on Gulf of Maine (USA) rocky shores have been hypothesized to represent stochastically determined community states, but we recently found that they were highly deterministic, consumer-controlled states in a tidal river. Mussel beds dominated high-flow habitats with high larval delivery and low consumer pressure, whereas algal canopies dominated low-flow habitats with high consumer pressure. In this paper we examine the alternative-community-state hypothesis on rocky shores on the open coast of Maine. We hypothesized that community states would be less deterministic due to reduced consumer pressure and more stochastic flow patterns.
   At 10 mussel-bed and 10 seaweed-canopy sites on the open coast of central Maine, we created 9-m(2) and 1-m(2) clearings and an unmanipulated control area, each containing control (no caging), caged, and cage-control quadrats. Independent of disturbance patch size, mussel beds and seaweed canopies rapidly began to return to their original community type in the absence of consumers (crabs and snails). With consumers present, recovery of the original communities did occur, but at a much slower pace.
   Our results suggest that mussel beds and algal canopies in the Gulf of Maine are deterministic consumer-controlled states, rather than being stochastically determined. If stochastic alternative community states exist in this system, they occur in a very restricted subset of habitats where the strong consumer control and determinism we have found in both tidal river and open coast habitats are relaxed.

AB Though established populations of invasive species can exert substantial competitive effects on native populations, exotic propagules may require disturbances that decrease competitive interference by resident species in order to become established. We compared the relative competitiveness of native perennial and exotic annual grasses in a California coastal prairie grassland to test whether the introduction of exotic propagules to coastal grasslands in the 19th century was likely to have been sufficient to shift community composition from native perennial to exotic annual grasses. Under experimental field conditions, we compared the aboveground productivity of native species alone to native species competing with exotics, and exotic species alone to exotic species competing with natives. Over the course of the four-year experiment, native grasses became increasingly dominant in the mixed-assemblage plots containing natives and exotics. Although the competitive interactions in the first growing season favored the exotics, over time the native grasses significantly reduced the productivity of exotic grasses. The number of exotic seedlings emerging and the biomass of dicot seedlings removed during weeding were also significantly lower in plots containing natives as compared to plots that did not contain natives. We found evidence that the ability of established native perennial species to limit space available for exotic annual seeds to germinate and to limit the light available to exotic seedlings reduced exotic productivity and shifted competitive interactions in favor of the natives. If interactions between native perennial and exotic annual grasses follow a similar pattern in other coastal grassland habitats, then the introduction of exotic grass propagules alone without changes in land use or climate, or both, was likely insufficient to convert the region's grasslands.

AB Gradient analysis uses ordination methods to study the structure of biotic communities caused by biotic processes operating in a heterogeneous environment. This. structure has two spatial components: spatial processes within the community create autocorrelation, and the spatial structure of environmental factors creates spatial dependence. Ordination methods', however, do not make use of spatial information. Spatial alternatives are available in multivariate geostatistics, but are not compatible with important ordination methods used in gradient analysis, correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis (CA, CCA). This paper shows how CA and CCA can be partitioned by distance (indirect and direct multi-scale ordination) and integrated with geostatistics. A diagnostic tool enables ecologists to partition ordination results by distance, to distinguish between components of spatial dependence and of spatial autocorrelation, and to check assumptions of independent residuals, stationarity, and scale-invariant correlation. The application is illustrated with a well-known data set of oribatid mites. Empirical chi-square variograms of individual species, their pair-wise cross variograms, and the variogram of the total inertia are defined and summarized in a variogram matrix, which leads to a spatial partitioning of the eigenvalues. The empirical variogram matrix provides a link to coregionalization analysis that may be used to simultaneously model spatial dependence and spatial autocorrelation. This will be useful for answering questions about the organism-specific scale of response to the environment, the optimal spacing of sampling units, or the scale-dependent effect of environmental factors.

ID BRITISH BUTTERFLIES; CLIMATE
AB As the climate warms, many species are moving to higher latitudes and elevations. However, range shifts can be caused by many factors. These factors are unknown in most cases. The specific role of climate in these dynamics needs study to better predict future consequences of global warming. This case study evaluates whether warming,is driving the northward range expansion of a skipper butterfly (Atalopedes campestris). Recently colonized areas have warmed 2-4degreesC over the past 50 years. To assess the importance of climate change for population persistence in these areas, I compared population dynamics at two locations (at the current range edge and just inside the range) that differ by 2-3degreesC. Population growth rate at these two locations over two years was positively correlated with January mean and annual mean temperatures. To determine whether larval overwinter survivorship could explain this correlation, I transplanted larvae over winter to both sites. Larval survivorship was very low at both locations, but significantly lower at the range edge, probably because lower lethal temperatures frequently occurred there. To estimate the direct effect of cold stress on larval survivorship, I applied a previously derived hazard-rate model based on laboratory experiments. With input from field-measured daily mean temperature, the model accurately predicted transplant survivorship at both locations over two winters. Combined results from population and larval transplant analyses indicate that winter temperatures directly affect the persistence of A. campestris at its northern range edge, and that winter warming was a prerequisite for this butterfly's range expansion.

AB Numerous studies, including those of desert plants, have shown reduced stomatal conductance under elevated atmospheric CO2. As a consequence, soil water has been postulated to increase. Soil water was measured for >4 yr at the Nevada Desert Free Air CO, Enrichment (FACE) Facility to determine if elevated atmospheric CO, conserves soil water for a desert scrub community in the Mojave Desert. We measured soil water in the top 0.2 and 0.5 m of soil with time domain reflectometry and to 1.85 m with a neutron probe for the three treatments at Desert FACE: elevated CO2 (550 mumol/mol), blower control (ambient CO2), and non-ring treatments. The treatment main effect was not significant in any analyses of variance. Although the treatment x date interaction was significant for soil water in the top 0.5 m of soil, the expected greater soil water for elevated CO2 vs. ambient CO2 only occurred on one sampling date. In contrast, soil water for that same depth was significantly lower under elevated CO2 on six dates. Thus, we infer that increased water use from increased primary productivity (and therefore leaf area) under elevated CO2 offset the decreased water use from reduced stomatal conductance, and hence soil water was not conserved under elevated CO2 in the Mojave Desert, unlike other ecosystems.

AB When predators differentiate among prey species, they commonly select the most abundant species. Surprisingly, on coral reefs in Australia and the Bahamas, we found evidence to the contrary: using null models, we observed that generalist predators had a greater impact on less-abundant species, thereby reducing local species richness. Disproportionate effects on these rare species were evident during a narrow window of time between settlement and 1-2 days later, highlighting how interactions during or immediately following settlement may influence subsequent community structure. Differences in species richness between treatments that were established during this narrow window of time eventually disappeared from reefs in Australia but persisted on reefs in the Bahamas. Our results highlight an unexpected and largely unexplored ecological interaction whereby predators reduce prey diversity.

AB Long-distance seed dispersal is an important topic in ecology, but notoriously difficult to quantity. Previous modeling approaches have failed to simulate long-distance dispersal, and it has remained unclear which mechanisms determine long-distance dispersal and what their relative importance is. We simulated wind dispersal of grassland plant seeds with four mechanistic models of increasing complexity and realism to assess which processes and which attributes of plants and their environment determine dispersal distances. We compared simulation results of the models to each other and to data from field dispersal experiments. The more complex and realistic models predicted short-distance dispersal more accurately and were the only models able to simulate long-distance dispersal. The model comparisons showed that autocorrelated turbulent fluctuations in vertical wind velocity are the key mechanism for long-distance dispersal. Seed dispersal distances are longest under high wind velocity conditions, when mechanically produced turbulent air movements are large. Under very low wind velocity conditions seeds are dispersed farther when there is more surface heating, but never as far as during strong wind events. Model sensitivity analyses showed that mean horizontal wind velocity, seed release height, and vegetation height are crucial determinants of dispersal potential and dispersal distances. Between plant species (but not within a species), seed terminal velocity is an additional important determinant of long-distance dispersal. These results imply that seed release height is the most important plant-controlled dispersal parameter for grassland plants, and that the structure of the local vegetation greatly affects dispersal distances. Thus, management plans for grasslands should take into account that changes in vegetation structure, e.g., due to eutrophication, can reduce the seed dispersal ability of wind-dispersed plant species.

AB Ammonium retention was studied in 12 tropical headwater streams differing in channel morphology and hydraulic characteristics. Results from NaCl and NH4Cl injections combining a one-dimensional transport model with the nutrient spiraling concept were evaluated. Transient solute storage was large in swamp reaches, with ratios of storage zone and main channel cross-sectional area (A(s)/A) of up to 18, and fractions of residence time due to transient storage ((200)(med)) of up to 94%. Moreover, transient storage was at an inter mediate level in step-pool and meandering reaches and low in run reaches. Maximum ammonium uptake potentials (U-MAX) varied by a factor of 15 due to differing stream morphologies, and ammonium retention was high in swamp and step-pool reaches, with U-max values as high as 1.8 mg N (.) m(-2). min(-1). Between 52% and 85% of ecosystem retention occurred in storage zones. Additionally, differences in ammonium uptake efficiency in the storage zones of contrasting stream morphotypes were negligible; hence, ecosystem ammonium uptake potential was determined by storage zone size. Interestingly, surface transient storage, which is usually neglected in stream tracer studies, was both an important transient storage mechanism and a strong determinant of ammonium uptake potentials. Here, we demonstrated that channel morphology controlled transient storage and ammonium retention potentials in these tropical ecosystems.

AB Many metapopulation models assume rules of population connectivity that are implicitly based on what we know about within-population dispersal, but especially for vertebrates, few data exist to assess whether interpopulation dispersal is just within-population dispersal "scaled up." We extended existing multi-stratum mark-release-recapture models to incorporate the robust design, allowing us to compare patterns of within- and between-population movement in the banner-tailed kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spectabilis). Movement was rare among eight populations separated by only a few hundred meters: seven years of twice-annual sampling captured >1200 individuals but only 26 interpopulation dispersers. We developed a program that implemented models with parameters for capture, survival, and interpopulation movement probability and that evaluated competing hypotheses in a model selection framework. We evaluated variants of the island, stepping-stone, and isolation-by-distance models of interpopulation movement, incorporating effects of age, season, and habitat (short or tall grass). For both sexes, QAIC(c) values clearly favored isolation-by-distance models, or models combining the effects of isolation by distance and habitat. Models with probability of dispersal expressed as linear-logistic functions of distance and as negative exponentials of distance fit the data equally well. Interpopulation movement probabilities were similar among sexes (perhaps slightly biased toward females), greater for juveniles than adults (especially for females), and greater before than during the breeding season (especially for females). These patterns resemble those previously described for within-population dispersal in this species, which we interpret as indicating that the same processes initiate both within- and between-population dispersal.

AB Determining whether seed production is pollen limited has been an area of intensive empirical study over the last two decades. Yet current evidence does not allow satisfactory assessment of the causes or consequences of pollen limitation. Here, we critically evaluate existing theory and issues concerning pollen limitation. Our main conclusion is that a change in approach is needed to determine whether pollen limitation reflects random fluctuations around a pollen-resource equilibrium, an adaptation to stochastic pollination environments, or a chronic syndrome caused by an environmental perturbation. We formalize and extend D. Haig and M. Westoby's conceptual model, and illustrate its use in guiding research on the evolutionary consequences of pollen limitation, i.e., whether plants evolve or have evolved to ameliorate pollen limitation. This synthesis also reveals that we are only beginning to understand when and how pollen limitation at the plant level translates into effects on plant population dynamics. We highlight the need for both theoretical and empirical approaches to gain a deeper understanding of the importance of life-history characters, Allee effects, and environmental perturbations in population declines mediated by pollen limitation. Lastly, our synthesis identifies a critical need for research on potential effects of pollen limitation at the community and ecosystem levels.

AB Many animal species are unevenly distributed across the landscape, in spatial patterns that continually shift over time. Such a shifting mosaic is thought to have profound implications for the persistence and stability of ecosystems. Management and conservation of natural systems would be enhanced if we could accurately predict movement. Such prediction has not yet been possible. Here we use an extensive set of field data on food abundance and quality, combined with experimentally derived measures of nutritional value, to predict the spatial distribution of Thomson's gazelles (Gazella thomsoni thomsoni Gunter) on the Serengeti Plains of East Africa. Twelve plausible models, based on alternate foraging objectives or movement rules, were assessed against field data on food and grazer abundance gathered at biweekly intervals (every two weeks) over the course of the wet seasons in two different years. Nomadic movements of gazelles closely tracked changes in the spatial distribution of short grass swards. Gazelles left short grass patches when local daily energy intake dropped below the expected intake averaged across the landscape. Subsequent redistribution of gazelles among neighboring patches was proportional to daily rates of energy intake in each patch. Thus, nomadic movements by Thomson's gazelles were predictable on the basis of local energy gain. This suggests that adaptive behavioral models can provide useful predictive tools for understanding the dynamics of complex natural systems.

AB Soil and nutrient properties, via their influence on nutrient diffusion rates in the soil, may play a key role in determining the outcome of plant competition for nutrients. We used two models to explore the potential contributions of nutrient uptake kinetics, root density, soil properties, and nutrient type to interspecific plant competition for soil nutrients. The first model uses well-known nutrient diffusion and absorption relationships to generate soil nutrient concentration maps and nutrient uptake at the scale of individual roots (PARIS-M). A second model (PARIS-E) was developed based on a fit of the Hill equation to the output of PARIS-M. The PARIS-E model provides an accurate and simple means of determining the relative contributions of sink strength (root surface area X uptake kinetics) vs. space occupation (number of roots per unit area) to competition at equilibrium as modeled by PARIS-M.
   An analysis based on these two models suggests the following: (1) Diffusive supply (soil nutrient buffer capacity X effective diffusion coefficient) determines the relative importance of space occupation vs. sink strength for nutrient competition. (2) At the low range of reported values of diffusive supply, competition depends on space occupation and, therefore, the species with the most roots per unit area is the most competitive. Sink strength gains in importance as diffusive supply increases and dominates competitive interactions at the high end of the range of reported diffusive supplies. (3) The relative importance of space occupation vs. sink strength depends primarily on soil water content and soil texture, because diffusive supply is sensitive to these factors. Diffusive supply is relatively insensitive to nutrient type.
   This analysis suggests that nutrient competition models should include the effects of soil properties as a determinant of the relative contributions of sink strength vs. space occupation.

AB Herbivore impacts on plants are predicted to be greatest in competitive and stressful environments. Plant neighbors can exert strong facilitative as well as competitive effects, however, and facilitation is often mediated through the reduction of environmental stresses. Thus, neighbors may simultaneously increase plant compensation for herbivory, by reducing environmental stress, and reduce compensation by competing for resources. To determine whether aboveground competition and facilitation influence the ability of an annual forb, Atriplex patula var. hastata, to compensate for herbivory, I performed a field experiment in which the presence of insect herbivores and plant neighbors were manipulated in a factorial design. The, neighbor treatments included removal of dominant rushes (cleared), rushes left intact (vegetated), and rush removal, plus reduction of environmental stress by shading of the soil surface (buffered). In cleared treatments, herbivory reduced survival by almost 50% and reproduction by 37%. In contrast herbivory had no significant effects on plant survival or reproductive output in buffered treatments. Thus, facilitation through soil shading increased plant compensation for herbivory. However, herbivores also strongly reduced fruit production (45%) in vegetated treatments, suggesting that competition magnifies herbivore impacts. The results demonstrate that neighboring plants can simultaneously increase and decrease plant tolerance to herbivory.

AB There is a wealth of literature documenting a directional change of body size in heavily harvested populations. Most of this work concentrates on aquatic systems, but terrestrial populations are equally at risk. This paper explores the capacity of harvest refuges to counteract potential effects of size-selective harvesting on the allele frequency,of populations. We constructed a stochastic, individual-based model parameterized with data on red kangaroos. Because we do not know which part of individual growth would change in the course of natural selection, we explored the effects of two alternative models of individual growth in which alleles affect either the growth rate or the maximum size. The model results show that size-selective harvesting can result in significantly smaller kangaroos for a given age when the entire population is subject to harvesting. In contrast, in scenarios that include dispersal from harvest refuges, the initial allele frequency remains virtually unchanged.

AB Two Agrostis taxa occur in geothermal habitats of Yellowstone National Park: Agrostis rossiae is reported to be endemic to the thermal areas and A. scabra occurs both in thermal and nonthermal habitats. Thermal populations of both taxa are always surrounded by a nonthermal population of A. scabra that is reproductively. isolated from the thermal plants by its later flowering time (summer rather than spring). Since Agrostis species are well known for their ability to form edaphic ecotypes, we used common garden and greenhouse experiments to test the hypothesis that "soil type" (a complex variable including factors such as soil chemistry and soil biotic community) was responsible for the separation of the thermal and nonthermal populations. In addition, field monitoring and growth chamber experiments were used to determine whether soil temperature affected the local distribution of these taxa. The results indicate that the thermal and nonthermal taxa are affected similarly by both soil temperature and soil type. The separate distribution of the thermal and nonthermal taxa is not due to the greater tolerance of one of these taxa for a particular factor, but instead to the interaction between seasonal fluctuations in soil temperature and the life history of the thermal and nonthermal plants. Nonthermal Agrostis plants, which are perennial, are excluded from the thermal habitats by lethal summer soil temperatures that limit the duration of the growing season, effectively selecting for precocious flowering and an annual habit. The thermal plants, in contrast, do not grow in the nonthermal matrix in prevailing cool field temperatures, but do grow in these habitats under artificially elevated temperatures. The thermal taxa may have reduced competitive ability at cooler temperatures. Thermal Agrostis have adopted a "stress avoidance" strategy, unlike previously studied thermal plants in Yellowstone, e.g., Dicanthelium lanuginosum, which are stress tolerant.

AB Tadpole density dependence has repeatedly been studied in laboratories and mesocosms, but rarely in natural ponds. The present study manipulated density in three ponds; each pond was divided into one low density section and one high density section. The experiment was run for eight years, switching density treatments within ponds among years. This experimental design cannot definitively separate the experimental density effects from certain lag effects. This problem is discussed. Nonetheless, in all ponds tadpole survival was affected by the density manipulation. The reduced survival of larvae at high density was most pronounced in the pond with the overall highest density. In this pond, the density-dependent mortality almost offset the original, experimental, density difference between sections. Effects on tadpole and metamorph size and development rate were found in those cases in which density-dependent mortality was weak and treatment effects on density persisted to the later stages of tadpole development. However, even if significant, these were generally of small magnitude compared to the variation among ponds and years. 1 suggest that different modes and degrees of regulation among populations of one species of frog are to be expected, not only due to variation in pond quality but also due to variation in the surrounding terrestrial habitat. This may determine the balance between tadpole and adult population regulation.

AB Although specialization in species interactions has usually been equated to reciprocal specialization, asymmetric specialization (i.e., a specialist interacting with a generalist) is also likely. Recent studies have suggested that asymmetric specialization in species interactions could be more common than previously thought. We contrasted patterns of asymmetric specialization observed in 18 plant-pollinator interaction webs with predictions based on null models. We found that asymmetric specialization is common in plant-pollinator interactions, and that its occurrence is more frequent than expected under a simple null model that assumed random interactions among species; furthermore, large assemblages with many pairs of,interacting species tend to have more asymmetric interactions than smaller assemblages. A second null model, which incorporated a correlation between species frequency of interaction and degree of specialization observed in most data sets produced patterns that were generally closer to those present in the data. At least three kinds of explanations could account for the observed asymmetric specialization, including random interactions among individuals (rather than species), adaptive consequences of specialization, and artifacts, such as data aggregation and sampling biases. Future studies should be aimed at understanding the relative importance of each of these alternative explanations in generating asymmetric specialization in species interactions.

AB The importance of fallen logs as recruitment sites for seedlings of some forest trees commonly is explained by the hospitable physical conditions such nurse logs provide. We used fungicide treatments to test whether logs also provide a refuge from,pathogenic soil fungi for seeds of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). We tested two seedlots. For one seedlot, fungicide significantly improved survival of seeds in the soil, while seeds in logs were unaffected. This suggests that logs provide a refuge from pathogenic soil fungi. For the second seedlot, fungicide did not significantly improve survival either in logs or in soil, even though survival of control seeds was significantly lower in soil. This suggests that factors other than fungi must contribute to the success of seedlings on logs. Together, these results indicate that logs provide both physical and biotic benefits to seeds of eastern hemlock. When pathogens are important, logs provide enemy-free space; when risks from pathogens are low, logs still provide an improved physical environment.

AB Climate can affect population dynamics in indirect ways via nonadditive forcing, by external variables on internal demographic rates. Current analytical techniques, employed in population ecology, fail to explicitly include nonadditive interactions between internal and external variables, and therefore cannot efficiently address indirect climate effects. Here, we present the results of all analysis, employing specifically developed statistical methodology, on density-dependent survival of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) prerecruitment stages in relation to background environmental variables in the Gulf of Alaska. We found that spring winds and water temperature mediate the intensity of density-dependent survival from the eggs to the age-0 stage. Fall water temperature and juvenile pollock predator abundance mediate density dependence from the age-0 to the age-1 stage. The inclusion of such nonadditive and nonlinear effects in a population dynamics model improved our ability to simulate pollock recruitment. Our results point to the importance of understanding nonadditive and nonlinear interactions between external (climate) and internal factors in the presence of underlying environmental variation. These topics are discussed in the context of current research priorities in population ecology and conservation biology.

AB Theoretical models show how temporal variability can promote plant species richness by slowing or preventing competitive exclusion. This call come about as a result of variation in the frequency, timing, or intensity of events such as frosts, rainfall, Soil disturbance. herbivore outbreak, or drought, as long as species exhibit niche differences in their responses to one or more of these factors. Here, I describe an experiment oil a community of >50 predominantly annual plant species. in which the timing of soil disturbance was varied experimentally over a 10-year period (1992-2001). Replicate plots were plowed once per year in October, March, or May, and disturbance timing had a marked impact on botanical composition front the outset. Following cultivation of all plots in fall 2002 or spring 2003, the effects of long-term cultivation timing oil biomass in July 2003 were significant for most species, and the effects were large (10-fold to 100-fold) for many species. Three guilds of species were apparent: fall germinators, spring germinators (seed, with a chilling requirement to break dormancy), and indifferent species (species germinating after disturbance, irrespective of timing). Some species were driven close to local extinction by annual Soil disturbance at the "wrong" time of yearn presumably their seed banks were small or rapidly depleted, and recruitment to their populations may have been more reliant oil the annual seed rain. Proof that temporal variability of disturbance is all important contributor to tong-term species coexistence requires a demographic approach showing both a storaga effect and relative nonlinearity of competition. This experiment represents a first step. by showing that different timings of disturbance call have large effects oil the biomass, frequency. and relative abundance of coexisting species.

AB We examined the effects of environmental conditions on the microbially mediated CO2 evolution from standing-dead litter (leaf blades, leaf sheaths, and culms) of the common reed, Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud., in two temperate littoral freshwater marshes. Water availability was the major factor affecting CO2 evolution rates. In the laboratory, microbial assemblages responded rapidly to controlled additions of water, with large increases in CO2 evolution occurring within five minutes after wetting of litter (e.g., leaf blades: 10-295 mug CO2-C.(g ash-free dry mass [AFDM])(-1).h(-1). Under field conditions, CO2 evolution in the absence of precipitation exhibited a pronounced diel periodicity, with the highest rates occurring during periods of increased water availability resulting from a temperature-induced rise in relative humidity (>95%) and corresponding litter water potential (>-2.0 MPa) during nighttime. For example, in October, rates of CO2 evolution over a 24-h cycle ranged from 5 to 223 mug CO2-C.(g AFDM)(-1).h(-1) for leaf blades and from 10 to 155 mug CO2-C.(g AFDM)(-1).h(-1) for leaf sheaths. Maximum rates of CO2 evolution from sheaths were consistently lower than those for leaf blades (by similar to25%), but were typically an order of magnitude higher than those observed from culm litter (e.g., 1.0-18 mug CO2-C.(g AFDM)(-1).h(-1) over a diel cycle in August) exposed to identical environmental conditions. Much of the differences in maximum CO2 evolution rates from different litter types were related (r(2) = 0.72) to differences in litter associated fungal biomass (leaf blades 34-74 mg (fry mass/g AFDM, leaf sheaths 16-67 mg dry mass/g AFDM, and culms 2-7 mg dry rnass/g AFDM), which was estimated from litter ergosterol concentrations. Based on measured stocks of standing-dead plant litter, estimated daily CO2 flux from standing-dead shoots ranged between 51 and 570 mg C/m(2) of wetland surface area. These values translate into a roughly estimated annual carbon mineralization equivalent to a mean of 8% (leaf blades), 29% (leaf sheaths), and 3% (culms) of net aboveground plant production. These data provide compelling evidence that microbial decomposition of plant litter in the aerial standing-dead phase can contribute appreciably to overall carbon flux from marshes to the atmosphere, even in cool temperate climates, where most wetlands occur.

AB We hypothesized that Neotropical passerines would invest more in costly immune function relative to north-temperate passerines, due to differences in their respective life histories. We further hypothesized that latitudinal variation in immune activity would persist in common-garden conditions. To test these hypotheses, we compared immune function, measured via phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced wing-web swelling in both wild House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) and House Sparrows kept under common-garden conditions for 18 months. We found that wild Neotropical sparrows had relatively stable immune responses across the year, whereas wild north-temperate sparrows showed substantial seasonal variation in immune activity, having lower responses than Neotroplical birds during the early breeding season and significantly higher responses than Neotropical birds during the late and nonbreeding seasons. Latitudinal differences in immune responses were not related to mass, sex, or body condition, but were influenced by mass change 24 hours after immune challenge. Under common-garden conditions, birds from both populations first decreased (after five months) and then increased (after IS months) their nonbreeding immune responses relative to wild values, indicating condition dependence in the PHA response. Relative differences in the PHA response between the populations, however, were maintained in captivity: after 18 months in common gardens, north-temperate sparrows exhibited stronger nonbreeding immune responses than Neotropical sparrows.

AB The ecological and evolutionary dynamics of fruit color polymorphisms remain poorly known because patterns and agents of selection have rarely been identified. Here, we examine Acacia ligulata, a shrub of the Australian arid zone characterized by a red/yellow/orange aril color polymorphism. Seed production patterns over four populations and three years suggested that spatially variable selection may be acting to maintain the polymorphism: red and yellow aril color morphs each had the highest seed production in alternate sites. Seed production differences between morphs were a function of both intrinsic plant characters (fruit production) and predispersal seed predation, which affects the number of viable seeds matured per ovule. Fruit production differences are hypothesized to result from a genotype-by-environment interaction, perhaps related to plant vigor. In contrast, morph differences in the numbers of viable seeds per ovule are produced via differential seed predation by heteropteran insects, as demonstrated by exclusion experiments. Because these predators feed when aril color is not visible, differential predation is evidently a response to pleiotropic effects of fruit color alleles. We suggest that such pleiotropic effects may be a common feature of fruit color polymorphisms, and that the most obvious selective agents (that is, seed dispersers) may not always be the most important.

AB Relative body size has long been recognized as a factor influencing reproductive success in fishes, but maternal age has only recently been considered. We monitored growth and starvation resistance in larvae from 20 female black rockfish (Sebastes melanops), ranging in age from five to 17 years. Larvae from the oldest females in our experiments had growth rates more than three times as fast and survived starvation more than twice as long as larvae from the youngest females. Female age was a far better predictor of larval performance than female size. The apparent underlying mechanism is a greater provisioning of larvae with energy-rich triacylglycerol (TAG) lipids as female age increases. The volume of the oil globule (composed primarily of TAG) present in larvae at parturition increases with maternal age and is correlated with subsequent growth and survival. These results suggest that progeny from older females can survive under a broader range of environmental conditions compared to progeny from younger females. Age truncation commonly induced by fisheries may, therefore, have severe consequences for long-term sustainability of fish populations.

AB Moose (Alces alces) in south-central Alaska have been found to have phenotypic life history trade-offs that can be partitioned into the same "bottom-up" and "topdown" trophic framework often applied at the population level. The potential interaction of these life history trade-offs was studied under varying degrees of predation and nutritional limitation using models based on data from radio-collared moose in south-central Alaska. The interaction was mildly antiregulatory, assuming that bottom-up trade-offs are density dependent. That is, as nutritional constraints increased, a female that skipped reproduction after successfully rearing a calf enhanced the survival of herself and her yearling enough in the second year to overcompensate for the loss of productivity. In a declining population, the reverse could occur, accentuating the decline. A more general, stage projection matrix was used to model a broader range of predation rates in summer and winter, in order to contrast the potential importance of bears (Ursus arctos and U. americanus) and wolves (Canis lupus) in such an interaction. The greatest effect of life history interactions on population growth occurred with moderate predation in summer and heavy predation in winter. Relative to direct ecological effects on survival and reproduction, the influence of such an interaction was relatively weak. However, subtle effects on the stability of predator-prey interactions, particularly those involving bear predation, cannot be excluded because of the antiregulatory nature of the interaction and uncertainties about class-specific vulnerability to predation in other settings. These findings underscore the relevance of understanding the alternative life history choices that arise from interactions in both directions on the food chain, particularly given-that the top-down trade-offs are usually poorly known.

AB Ecosystem-level studies of producer-decomposer interactions have focused primarily on plant production and soil texture as regulators of decomposer abundance but have rarely considered the role of grazers in mediating such interactions. Here, we conducted replicated exclosure experiments at both high and low levels of soil fertility to investigate the effects of large, mammalian grazers on decomposer biomass and activity patterns in a semiarid grazing ecosystem in Kenya. Within only two years of grazer exclusion, microbial biomass was greater in soil of fenced grassland across all levels of soil fertility. This consistent negative effect of grazers on microbial biomass occurred despite the fact that grazers stimulated aboveground plant production in nutrient-rich sites and depressed it in nutrient-poor sites. A consideration of all the potential pathways by which grazers influence decomposer populations suggests that observed grazing-induced reductions in microbial biomass were predominantly associated with a depression in the amount of plant carbon inputs to soils. Finally, across all study sites, microbial biomass was highly correlated with soil carbon content, suggesting that landscape-scale constraints on soil organic matter content and plant production overarch grazer effects on microbial abundance. Our results support previous ecosystem-level studies showing that microbial biomass and growth are constrained by plant production and soil C availability. In addition, our findings demonstrate that decomposer abundance can be influenced by an ecosystem's trophic structure, with significant reductions in microbial biomass occurring as a result of herbivores diverting plant carbon away from soils.

AB Intraspecific, negative density dependence may contribute to the maintenance of diversity by limiting the dominance of common species. Shorea quadrinervis Slooten (Dipterocarpaceae) is one of the dominant canopy trees in a species-rich tropical rain forest in Southeast Asia. We test whether juvenile density and performance and overall population growth rate of S. quadrinervis decline with increasing local abundance of conspecific adult trees.
   We mapped the 357 S. quadrinervis adults (greater than or equal to15 cm dbh) in 75 ha at Gunung Palung National Park, Indonesian Borneo, and compared the dynamics of juveniles <1 cm dbh between eight areas (80 in diameter plots) with high densities of conspecific adults and eight containing low densities. Within these 16 areas, we mapped 5215 S. quadrinervis juveniles and followed their growth and survival for two years. Plots with high and low density of S. quadrinervis adults did not differ in understory light, slope, aspect, or soil properties nor in the total density (all species combined) of either adults or juveniles.
   We evaluated four kinds of evidence. All were consistent with the hypothesis of negatively density-dependent population dynamics: (1) Density and size: Although the density of juveniles <25 cm tall per capita adult increased with local adult density, the pattern reversed for juveniles >75 cm tall. This suggests positive density-dependent seedling recruitment followed by negative density-dependent juvenile dynamics. (2) Foliar condition: Juveniles had more leaves per Unit height where adult density was low. Growth and survival increased more with leaf number than with height. (3) Juvenile dynamics: Growth and survival were higher where adult density was low. Previous work suggests that herbivores may drive this negative density dependence in juvenile performance. (4) Population dynamics: We modeled population growth rate (X) for each of the 16 areas using separate matrix models parameterized with empirical juvenile transition rates. We found that X declined with local adult density (r(2) = 0.40), and this trend was robust to the inclusion of El Ni (n) over tildeo conditions. We conclude that replacement of adults in the canopy is less likely in areas where conspecific adults are more abundant, tending to limit the dominance of S. quadrinervis in the canopy.

AB Both dynamic and topologic approaches in food webs have shown how structure alters conditions for stability. However, while most studies concerning the structure of food webs have shown a nonrandom pattern, it still remains unclear how this structure is related to compartmentalization and to responses to perturbations. Here we build a bridge between connectance, food web structure, and compartmentalization by studying how links are distributed within and between subwebs. A "k subweb" is defined as a subset of species that are connected to at least k species from the same subset. We study the k subweb frequency distribution (i.e., the number of k subwebs in each food web). This distribution is highly skewed, decaying in all cases as a power law. The most dense subweb has the most interactions, despite containing a small number of species, and shows connectivity values independent of species richness. The removal of the most dense subweb implies,multiple fragmentation. Our results show a cohesive organization, that is, a high number of small subwebs highly connected among themselves through the most dense subweb. We discuss the implications of this organization in relation to different types of disturbances.

AB Fire contributes to the maintenance of species diversity in many plant communities, but few studies have compared its impacts in similar communities that vary in such attributes as soils and productivity. We compared how a wildfire affected plant diversity in chaparral vegetation on serpentine and sandstone soils. We hypothesized that because biomass and cover are lower in serpentine chaparral, space and light are less limiting, and therefore postfire increases in plant species diversity would be lower than in sandstone chaparral. In 40 pairs of burned and unburned 250-m(2) plots, we measured changes in the plant community after a fire for three years. The diversity of native and exotic species increased more in response to fire in sandstone than serpentine chaparral, at both the local (plot) and regional (whole study) scales. In serpentine compared with sandstone chaparral, specialized fire-dependent species were less prevalent, mean fire Severity was lower, mean time since last fire was longer, postfire shrub recruitment was lower, and regrowth of biomass was slower. Within each chaparral type, the responses of diversity to fire were positively correlated with prefire shrub cover and with a number of measures of soil fertility. Fire severity was negatively related to the postfire change in diversity in sandstone chaparral, and unimodally related to the postfire change in diversity in serpentine chaparral. Our results suggest that the effects of fire on less productive plant communities like serpentine chaparral may be less pronounced, although longer lasting, than the effects of fire on similar but more productive communities.

AB Herbivores have major impacts on many marine algae and are assumed to have been important forces driving the evolution of algal chemical defenses. However, an evolutionary change in chemical defenses in response to herbivory requires that there is both heritable variation for that trait and a response by herbivores to such variation. The subtidal red alga Delisea pulchra produces four main secondary metabolites (furanones) that vary in concentration at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Here we determined the heritability of furanone concentrations and then, with a series of feeding experiments, determined how feeding by herbivores associated with D. pulchra varied as a function of nonpolar extract and furanone concentration. Total furanone concentration showed significant broad-sense heritability (h(C)(2) = 0.234), but broad-sense heritability of the four individual furanones varied in magnitude, ranging from 0.058 to 0.321. Compound 3, which is often the most abundant furanone, was the only one of the four furanones to show significant genetic variation. However, all four furanones were strongly genetically correlated, indicating that selection acting on any one of them will cause a corresponding change in the others. With the exception of the mesograzer gastropod Phasianotrochus eximius, herbivores generally consumed D. pulchra at lower rates compared to other common macroalgae. Macrograzers (sea urchins and large gastropods) were mostly deterred by nonpolar extract that contained levels of furanones that spanned the range of furanone variation in the field. The amphipod Ampithoe ngana was not deterred at the lowest extract concentration, and P. eximius was not deterred by any naturally occurring extract concentration. Compound 3 was deterrent to macrograzers at 3 and 5 mg/g dry mass, but was not deterrent at 1 mg/g dry mass. Compound 3 was also not deterrent to A. ngana at any of those concentrations. For the most part D. pulchra in the field contains concentrations of furanones that are strongly deterrent to most herbivores. However, at some places and times, furanones do occur at lower concentrations that are not deterrent to herbivores. Given the heritable variation for furanones, when this overlap occurs there is the potential for selection by herbivores for higher concentrations of furanones in D. pulchra.

AB Most models of floral specialization assume that adaptations to a particular type of pollinator incur a fitness trade-off in reduced effectiveness of others. To examine this assumption and characterize the form of trade-offs, I manipulated floral form in Dudleya greenei (Crassulaceae), a species that is pollinated by hummingbirds, bumble bees, and other insects. Existing pollination literature predicts that pollination by hummingbirds should favor narrower flowers than pollination by humble bees. When hummingbirds alone visited experimental populations, narrow flowers indeed performed best by most measures. Hummingbirds showed a slight preference for flowers of intermediate width but deposited more pollen per visit and more pollen overall, and they exported more dye (a pollen analogue) as corolla flare decreased. Bees were more effective than birds at pollinating wide flowers but did not generate overall performance trade-offs. Bees also preferred flowers of intermediate width and deposited more pollen per visit and more pollen overall as corolla flare decreased, but the overall efficiency with which bumble bees exported dye was independent of corolla flare. This demonstrates that phenotypic specialization for hummingbirds might evolve without trading-off the effectiveness of bumble bees. However, both birds and bees tended to transfer dye most efficiently between like phenotypes, suggesting that the form of selection and presence of trade-offs may be frequency dependent in natural populations.

AB We examined whether grazing fishes exert density-dependent effects on the spatial heterogeneity of resources and benthic species diversity in a tropical Andean stream. We hypothesized that bulldozer grazers (i.e., all or nothing grazing) can be important sources of spatial heterogeneity and that a unimodal relationship should exist between grazer density and resource heterogeneity. We reasoned that organismally generated heterogeneity would be minimal at low densities if grazers are ineffective, and at high densities if grazers thoroughly remove resources. In contrast, spatial heterogeneity should be highest at intermediate densities as bulldozer grazers maintain a dynamic mosaic of resource states. We posited that a corresponding unimodal relationship should exist between grazer density and benthic diversity, if resource heterogeneity is an important mechanism maintaining species diversity.
   We carried out observational and experimental studies to test our hypotheses. First, we quantified natural spatial patterns of benthic resources across transects using fish feeding scars as surrogates. We then analyzed data using a set of landscape indices that capture different components of heterogeneity. A large degree of spatial heterogeneity of algal and sediment resources was apparent both within and among pools. Second, we manipulated densities of the common grazing fish Parodon apolinari (Parodontidae) in 8-m(2) pens, and quantified spatial heterogeneity and corresponding benthic diversity within enclosures. Parodon exerted strong density-dependent effects on the spatial heterogeneity of resources. Initially (at 7 d) we observed a unimodal relationship between grazer density and spatial heterogeneity along our density gradient (1.25-10.0 Parodon/m(2)), as predicted. However, at 14 d, our lowest fish density (1.25 Parodon/m(2)) was sufficient to generate substantial spatial heterogeneity. Although grazers were major sources of heterogeneity, we found little support for the hypothesis that organismally generated heterogeneity is an important mechanism for maintaining species diversity. Interestingly, the greatest invertebrate richness occurred in high density treatments, which had the most spatially uniform resource distributions. These results suggest that at the within-pool scale, grazers can have important effects on both spatial heterogeneity and benthic diversity, yet their generation of resource patchiness does not appear to be the underlying mechanism driving strong fish effects on species diversity.

AB Despite recognition of the significance of both food web interactions and habitat complexity in community dynamics, current ecological theory rarely couples these two processes. Experimental manipulations of the abundance of the two predators in an oyster-reef trophic cascade, and the structural complexity provided by reefs of living oysters, demonstrated that enhanced habitat complexity weakened the strengths of trophic interactions. The system of tri-trophic interactions included oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau) as the top predator that consumed the mud crab (Panopeus herbstii), which preys upon juvenile oysters (Crassostrea virginica). On reefs of low complexity, toadfish controlled mud crab abundances and indirectly determined the level of mortality of juvenile oysters. The indirect effects of toadfish on oysters emerged through their influence on how intensely mud crabs preyed on oysters. Augmentation of habitat complexity by substituting vertically oriented, living oysters for the flat shells of dead oysters disrupted both of the direct trophic linkages but did not alter the magnitude of the indirect effect of toadfish on juvenile oysters. This paradox can be understood by partitioning the mechanisms by which toadfish influence mud crabs and ultimately juvenile oysters. Trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs; i.e., predator-avoidance behavior in mud crabs) accounted for 95.6-98.2% of toadfish indirect benefits to oyster survival and, consequently, were a much greater contributor than density-mediated indirect interactions (DMIIs; i.e., the reduction in crab abundance by toadfish). Avoidance behavior was unaffected by modification in habitat complexity. Complex reefs increased total oyster survival because added habitat complexity reduced mud crab predation on oysters. Additionally, the magnitude of this effect was much greater than the increase in oyster mortality as a result of complex reefs disrupting toadfish predation on mud crabs. This experimental demonstration of how habitat complexity modifies trophic interactions in a temperate reef community has fundamental implications for our understanding of species interaction webs and community structure. The influence of habitat complexity on the strength of a trophic cascade generally may depend upon whether physical complexity provides actual and perceived refuges for component predator-prey pairs.

AB Ecological patterns and processes often change with scale, and determining how they do so is a necessary first step in understanding these relationships. We documented how the spatial patterns of beetle species richness, environmental variables, and correlations between the two change with spatial scale. Tenebrionid beetles and vegetation coverage were sampled on the shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado during June and August 1998. We used triplet quadrat variance (tQV) and triplet quadrat covariance (tQC) to evaluate the spatial patterns of beetle distribution and environmental variables.
   As revealed by tQV, spatial patterns of beetle species richness and environmental measures were scale dependent but differed among transects. Bare ground exhibited significant patchiness at spatial scales in the 460-500-m range, grass at 460-540 m, and shrubs at 420-620 m. Tenebrionid species richness in June showed significant patchiness in the 400-420-m and 560-640-m range, while August patch dimensions were in the 200-360-m and 400-520-m ranges. As revealed by tQC, correlations between tenebrionid species richness and environmental measures were not scale dependent, nor was there much variation between transects.
   Univariate, multiscaled analyses revealed potentially significant scales; however, covariate, multiscaled analyses revealed no scale dependence of interaction. These analyse's showed (1) that while spatial scale is important, it is often unpredictable and (2) that multiscaled analysis in realistic settings may not capture species' relevant heterogeneity.

AB "Reid's paradox" is the mismatch between theoretical estimates of invasion rates for plants and "observed" rates of plant migration, particularly in the Holocene postglacial migration northwards. While Reid couched his paradox in terms of the migration of oaks in Great Britain, observers have documented the same problem in a wide variety of species. In almost all cases, these authors suggest that occasional, long-distance events, probably mitigated by active dispersal factors (ants, birds, rodents) are responsible. Clark and co-workers have shown that order statistics can bridge the gap between theory and predictions, essentially using "fat-tailed" dispersal kernels raised to high powers corresponding to rare, distant dispersal events. However, the spatial caching structure induced by most active dispersers has not been specifically examined.
   In this paper we develop a complementary approach to order statistics, based on the theory of homogenization, to describe the long-distance dispersal probabilities of seeds. The homogenization approach includes the spatial structure of active dispersal explicitly, and generates a corrective factor to current estimates of migration rates. This corrective factor is the "caching scale ratio," the ratio of mean scatter-hoard size to mean separation between cache sites, and is, in principle. directly observable. The methodology is not limited to animal dispersers and can be used to address any set of dispersal agencies operating at differing scales, in one or more spatial dimensions. This approach is tested for three dispersal mutualisms where Reid's paradox is known to operate: harvester ant/wild ginger, Blue Jay/ oaks, and nutcracker/stone pine. Migration rates predicted using the homogenized approach compare favorably with estimates for tree species based on the paleo-ecological record. However, these rates do not seem to explain the Holocene migration of wild ginger.

AB We used field, common garden, and laboratory studies to investigate the influence of environmental stress on a native wetland species, Iris hexagona (Iridaceae), and an iris leafminer, Cerodontha iridiphora.(Diptera: Agromyzidae). There were strong effects of salinity, herbivory, and phenology on jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA), two important signal phytohormones. Within 48 h, foliar JA increased an order of magnitude, and SA declined 50% in plants grown under salinity stress compared to freshwater controls. Leafminer performance declined on plants exposed to the salinity treatment. Both herbivory and salinity stress induced JA and suppressed SA, indicating that plants can respond to abiotic and biotic stress through shared hormonal pathways. Surprisingly, leafminer pupae contained JA and SA, and we discuss the implications of this novel discovery. Unrelated to salinity, there was a sharp decline in foliar JA between April and September. Despite its strong impact on hormonal signaling in plants, the abiotic environment is often ignored in ecological studies of induced plant defenses. Importantly, natural seasonal cycles and/ or environmental stress can induce, stronger changes in phytohormones than herbivory, and should be incorporated into the design of ecological experiments whenever possible, for a balanced understanding of phytohormonal ecology.

AB To examine how global change could influence species invasions, we compared the responses of energetic processes and growth of invasive and native grass species to atmospheric CO2 enrichment in an intact Mojave Desert ecosystem. Combined with its modest influence on photosynthetic activity, elevated atmospheric CO2 was associated with a significant reduction in the energetic cost of aboveground biomass construction in invasive Bromus madritensis spp. rubens (red brome) without a concurrent cost reduction in native Vulpia octoflora (six-weeks fescue). Consequently, the invasive grass species grew faster, grew bigger, and produced more seeds with atmospheric CO2 enrichment than the native grass species. As a physiological mechanism of invasive species success driven by CO2 enrichment, such alterations in biomass construction costs combined with increased photosynthetic activity could trigger a shift in the species composition of this ecosystem, and potentially that of other invaded ecosystems, toward increased invasive species dominance.

AB Recent research in aquatic systems suggests that productivity-richness relationships change with spatial scale and that species turnover (i.e., spatial and temporal variation in species composition) plays an important role in generating this scale dependence. The generality of such scale dependence and the effects of variation in temporal scale remain unknown. We examined the extent to which the richness-productivity relationship in terrestrial plant communities depends on spatial or temporal scale and evaluated how spatial and temporal turnover (i.e., species turnover in space and time) generates scale dependence in these relationships using data from two Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites (Jornada and Konza). We found a weak hump-shaped relationship (Jornada) and no relationship (Konza) between richness and productivity at the smallest focal scale (I m(2) at Jornada and 50 m(2) at Konza) at each site, but strong hump-shaped relationships at the largest focal scale (49 m(2) at Jornada and 200 m(2) at Konza) for each site. Relationships between spatial turnover and productivity at each site mirrored the productivity-richness relationships that emerged at the larger spatial scale (i.e., a significant hump-shaped pattern). In contrast, temporal turnover was unrelated to productivity, and hence increasing temporal scale did not appreciably change the form of the productivity-richness relationship. Our study suggests that the way in which productivity-richness relationships change with spatial or temporal scale depends on the form and strength of the underlying relationship between species turnover and productivity. Moreover, we contend that a dominant effect of increasing productivity is the generation of dissimilarity in species composition among localities that comprise a region, rather than increasing the number of species that occur within local communities. Thus, understanding the mechanisms that cause species turnover to vary with productivity is critical to understanding scale dependence in richness-productivity relationships.

AB Dispersal of propagules may have far-reaching consequences for the local dynamics of open populations. In aquatic environments the dispersal and supply of larvae is strongly influenced by coastal-scale hydrodynamics. The role of local flow on settlement and recruitment is, however, poorly understood. In a test of the effect of local hydrodynamics on recruitment dynamics we studied the relationships between local flow speed and larval supply, contact rate, settlement, and recruitment rates for the barnacle Balanus improvisus. Planktonic cyprid larvae were sampled with pumps while suspended panels were used to measure initial contact (grease-coated panels), settlement (5-d immersion), and recruitment (30-d immersion). Larval supply varied with coastal-scale upwelling but was uncorrelated to local flow speed. Settlement rate was highly correlated to contact rate, and the proportion of settling larvae increased with established recruit density. In contrast to model predictions, contact rate was negatively correlated with local flow speed, which explained 33% of total variation. This correlation was maintained through settlement and recruitment suggesting that flow-mediated initial contact is an important link between larval supply and recruitment. No evidence from field studies indicated behavioral responses by larvae to flow although observations in a laboratory flume suggested active rejection of potential settlement sites at increasing flow speeds. It is suggested that initial adhesion is limited by flow speed through drag and lift forces acting on larvae. A conceptual model of mechanisms controlling the transfer of planktonic larvae to recruited benthic individuals is proposed.

AB We explore the effects of,ender dimorphism on resistance (damage avoidance) and tolerance (growth and fitness compensation) to a flower bud clipping weevil in a gynodioecious wild strawberry. Using both natural populations and a common garden, we document pervasive hermaphrodite-biased damage and identify several floral traits associated with resistance. Lower flower number, lower pollen production per flower, and earlier flowering date were associated with higher resistance. Because the sex morphs do not differ in flower number or flowering time, the presence of pollen is the main factor determining sex-differential resistance. We confirmed that simulated clipping was a good surrogate for weevil clipping, and we used simulated clipping to assess sex-morph- and sex-function-specific tolerance. We found that females were less tolerant than hermaphrodites in terms of seed and fruit production, but the sex morphs were similarly unable to compensate fully in flower production. Hermaphrodites showed some ability to compensate in pollen per flower, but this was not large enough to offset flower losses, leading to net undercompensation for pollen per plant. We evaluated potential mechanisms for tolerance and found that the number of reserve buds was the most consistent predictor of tolerance. Finally, we found that herbivory shifted sex expression of hermaphrodites toward greater femaleness via both plastic changes in allocation and direct effects of loss of male-functioning flowers. Our work indicates that the effects of herbivory on sexual system evolution can include sexual phenotype-biased herbivore damage and sex-dependent tolerance, as well as herbivory-induced changes in hermaphrodite sex allocation. In addition, this study suggests that pollen production is subject to selection via herbivores that opposes selection mediated by pollinators.

AB Natural disturbance boundaries have fundamental influences on landscape function; however, quantitative examination of the factors influencing their formation has been limited. Boundary formation is the final component of a disturbance event trio (initiation, propagation, and cessation) and is least well understood. I examined the influences of five stand-level variables (tree age, tree density, basal area of susceptible trees, slope aspect, and slope angle) and space as a surrogate for the unmeasurable factors on standardized tree mortality (basal area dead/total basal area) using multiple causal path hypotheses with data from seven wildfire and 11 mountain pine beetle (MPB) boundaries in British Columbia, Canada. One hundred percent of fire sites and 91% of MPB sites showed strong support for a positive effect of the basal area of susceptible trees (as defined by their propensity to burn or to be attacked by MPB) on tree mortality (r = 0.21-0.81). In addition, seven of 11 MPB boundaries had mortality patterns that were affected only indirectly by the spatial location across the boundary. This indirect effect of space suggests that other unmeasured spatial factors were not responsible for the pattern of mortality. Thus, MPB dispersal limitation did not appear to be an important factor stopping the outbreaks at these seven sites. A population based approach would be insufficient for understanding the location of the boundaries. On the other hand, mortality in all fire boundaries was directly affected by the spatial location across the boundary. In the context of multiple hypothesis testing of path models, this indicates that there was an important influence of spatially varying but unmodeled factors, such as weather and surface vegetation. Furthermore, path models that included other factors explicitly examined in this study (tree density, tree age, aspect, and slope) were rarely supported by the data, suggesting little contribution to boundary formation. These results demonstrate that the combined use of spatial plots, path analysis, and a priori multiple hypotheses can give important insight into the functioning of ecological processes.

AB We investigated the effects of an exotic snail, the golden apple snail (Pomacea canaliculata) on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in tropical wetland ecosystems. This large snail (up to 80-mm shell height) has invaded large parts of Southeast Asia during recent decades. A survey of natural wetlands in Thailand showed that high densities of the snail were associated with almost complete absence of aquatic plants, high nutrient concentrations, and high phytoplankton biomass, that is, a complete shift in both ecosystem state and function. A field experiment demonstrated that grazing by the snail can cause the loss of aquatic plants, a change toward dominance of planktonic algae, and thereby a shift toward turbid water. Estimates of biologically fixed nutrients released through snails grazing on aquatic plants revealed that phosphorus releases were sufficient to explain the recorded increase in phytoplankton biomass. Hence, our study demonstrates how an herbivore may trigger a shift from clear water and macrophyte dominance to a turbid state dominated by planktonic algae. This shift and the continuing aggressive invasion of this exotic species are detrimental to the integrity and functioning of wetland ecosystems, and to the services these provide in Southeast Asia.

AB Defenses against predators may be physiological, morphological, behavioral, or combinations thereof and are nearly always induced, at least in part, by prey perception of predation risk. One antipredation behavior is to group; however the way in which this translates into a reduction in risk to an individual is not fully understood. Here we demonstrate a novel aspect of grouping as a defense, using aggregated limpets (Patella vulgata) as a test system. Although not having experienced the predator directly, potential prey in aggregations detect the vibrations of an attack on a group member and reduce their vulnerability to predation. This effect travels further and lasts longer than would be expected. Our results imply that, for a prey showing a mix of distributions (some solitary and some aggregated), aggregations may probably be easier to find but actually represent a single predation opportunity.

AB Previous studies in tundra ecology provide evidence for sensitivity of the vegetation-soil complex to climate. Short-term experiments (less than or equal to10 yr) suggest that climate change may have a decade-scale effect on soil moisture, decomposition and nutrient availability, plant phenology, and plant growth. In contrast, there exists little evidence to confirm or refute the role of climate in structuring tundra vegetation over longer time scales (10 to 1000 yr). This study accordingly examines similar to1500 yr in the stratigraphy of two permafrost sediment cores from a High Arctic, polygon-patterned, graminoid-moss tundra. Present-day bryophyte-environment relationships are quantified, and the radiocarbon-dated macrofossil record of bryophytes is used to reconstruct past changes in soil moisture. The paleoecological record is characterized by pronounced variability during polygon development. As the hydrology of tundra polygons is controlled by known climatic and geomorphologic mechanisms, the recurrent development of polygon vegetation (cf. hydrologic change) is compared to an independent paleoclimatic proxy for net radiation (R-n). Based on this comparison, the vegetation provides support for a pronounced shift to colder and wetter conditions during the Little Ice Age (similar to300-465 yr BP), though the long-term response to past climate change is otherwise equivocal. We suggest accordingly that autogenic geomorphologic-vegetation processes may have been generally more important than climate in the long-term development of the polygon-patterned wetland examined. A framework for such processes is presented. We caution that previous research to simulate and describe the effects of climate warming might not have properly accounted for the dynamic role of geomorphology in regulating tundra microclimate.

AB In a variable and unpredictable environment, phenotypic plasticity in morphology or behavior may considerably improve an organism's protection against environmental threats and thereby its fitness. Here I demonstrate that common freshwater organisms, copepods (Crustacea), show a plastic response by adjusting pigmentation level in relation to two environmental threats: ultraviolet radiation (UV) and predation. The red pigment in copepods, astaxanthin, reduces damage caused by UV radiation, but makes the organism more conspicuous, thereby exposing it to higher predation pressure. In a field survey of six lakes sampled monthly for 16 mo, I quantified UV and predation threat, as well as copepod pigmentation level. The relative threat ratio (UV/predation) was generally lowest during summer and highest during spring; this pattern was paralleled by pigmentation level among copepods. Moreover, the level of pigmentation among copepods in lakes with high predation pressure was lower than among those copepods in lakes with lower risk of predation. In a complementary experimental study performed under constant UV threat, calanoid copepods in the absence of predation threat responded with almost three times higher pigment levels, compared to those with fish present (caged). Hence, the correlative field survey and the mechanistic experiment together suggest that the level of pigmentation in copepods is an inducible and adjustable defense, governed by the aim to improve individual protection against prevailing threats from both predation and UV radiation.

AB We examined the effects of the sit-and-wait spider Misumenops argenteus (Thomisidae) on the herbivore assemblage and fitness of the perennial woody shrub Trichogoniopsis adenantha (Asteraceae). Because crab spiders prey on both pollinators and phytophagous insects, they can have potentially negative and positive effects on plants. In a manipulative experiment using paired plants, spiders decreased the density of sucking and some endophagous herbivores on the leaves and capitula and reduced the number of damaged achenes produced by the plants. Damaged capitula had a higher proportion of fertilized achenes in plants with spiders than without spiders, but not undamaged capitula. These results indicate that M. argenteus exerted a double positive effect on seed production in T. adenantha. The effect of M. argenteus on herbivores may be taxon specific and vary among years with different herbivore abundances.

AB Habitat alteration and biotic invasions are the two leading causes of global environmental change and biodiversity loss. Recent innovative experiments have shown that habitat disturbance can have drastic effects that cascade to adjacent ecosystems by altering the flow of resource subsidies from donor systems. Likewise, exotic species invasions could alter subsidies and affect distant food webs, but very few studies have tested this experimentally. Here we report evidence from a large-scale field experiment in northern Japan that invasion of normative rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) interrupted reciprocal flows of invertebrate prey that drove stream and adjacent riparian forest food webs. Rainbow trout usurped terrestrial prey that fell into the stream, causing native Dolly Varden charr (Salvelinus malma) to shift their foraging to insects that graze algae from the stream bottom. This indirectly increased algal biomass, but also decreased biomass of adult aquatic insects emerging from the stream to the forest. In turn, this led to a 65% reduction in the density of riparian-specialist spiders in the forest. Thus, species invasions can interrupt flows of resources between interconnected ecosystems and have effects that propagate across their boundaries, effects that may be difficult to anticipate without in-depth understanding of food web relationships.

AB This study considers how a forager moves through its environment when food is patchily distributed and the patches differ in quality. One possibility is to move directionally among patches, staying longer in the best patches (the "Local-Experience Hypothesis"). Additionally, when foragers reuse patches in a regenerating environment, they can potentially benefit from remembering the most profitable patches, and return preferentially to these (the "Memory Hypothesis"). Both hypotheses were tested with foraging humble bees (Bombus spp.) collecting nectar in the foothills and mountains of southwest Alberta, Canada. Individually marked worker humble bees were observed visiting flowers on focal plants of five species visited primarily by bumble bees. In three plant species (Epilobium angustifolium, Hedysarum alpinum, and Penstemon confertus), variation in nectar secretion rate was experimentally induced by defoliation and fertilization of individual plants. In the other two species (H. sulphurescens and Oxytropis monticola), bees' responses to natural variation in plant-level nectar secretion were measured. Considering the bee population as a whole, plants with higher nectar production rates attracted more bees (three of five plant species) and had more of their. flowers visited (three of five plant species). The Local -Experience Hypothesis was supported in three of the five plant species: individual bees stayed longer by visiting more flowers on plants with higher rates of nectar production. The Memory Hypothesis was supported in four of the five plant species; individual bees were more likely to return to plants with higher rates of nectar secretion. Overall, there was a positive correlation between the extent to which individual plants differed in their rate of nectar secretion (a species-level trait), and the strength of support for the Memory Hypothesis (measured as a standardized effect size). That is, individual bumble bees more strongly adjusted their visitation rate based on plant quality as the magnitude of natural differences in plant quality increased. Support for the Memory Hypothesis may explain why bumble bees often revisit the same plants on successive foraging trips: memory for good plants gives them a fitness advantage over naive bees using the same area. Bumble bees appear to use a relatively sophisticated spatial memory in resource tracking, which may constrain the evolution of empty-flower strategies of plant nectar secretion.

AB The rank-abundance distribution (RAD) represents the manner in which species divide resources. Community-specific division rules that determine resource allocation among species, and thereby the shape of the RAD, have been hypothesized to account for observed stability of local species richness over time. While the shape of the RAD has been well studied, the temporal dynamics of this distribution have received much less attention. Here we assess changes in the shape of the RAD through time in a desert rodent community in Arizona (USA). Because energy use may be more appropriate for studying resource division than abundance, we also evaluate an energetic equivalent of the RAD. Significant, directional trends in the shapes of both distributions are present in this community. These changes are driven by trends in the relative abundances (or energy use) of Ranks 2, 3, and 4, and are significantly correlated with variation in total energy use by the community and with compositional change. Our results suggest that (1) rank-abundance and rank-energy distributions are not static and can change directionally through time, (2) species richness and rank distributions are not necessarily as intimately connected as early Studies assumed, and (3) rank-abundance and rank-energy distributions are influenced by both the amount of energy available to the community and species-specific interactions.

AB Mechanisms that explain shifts in species composition over environmental gradients continue to intrigue ecologists. Ecological stoichiometry has recently provided a new potential mechanism linking resource (light and nutrient) supply gradients to grazer performance via elemental food-quality mechanisms. More specifically, it predicts that light and nutrient gradients should determine the relative dominance of P-rich taxa, such as Daphnia, in grazer assemblages. We tested this hypothesis in pond mesocosms (cattle tanks) by creating gradients of resource supply and predation risk, to which we added diverse assemblages of algal producer and zooplankton grazer species. We then characterized the end-point composition of grazer assemblages and quantity and elemental food quality of edible algae. We found that somatically P-rich Daphnia only dominated grazer assemblages in high-nutrient, no-predator. treatments. In these ecosystems, P sequestered in producers exceeded a critical concentration. However, other grazers having even higher body P content did not respond similarly. These grazers were often abundant in low-nutrient environments with poorer food quality. At face value, this result is problematic for ecological stoichiometry because body composition did not correctly predict response of these other species. However, two potential explanations could maintain consistency with stoichiometric principles: species could differentially use a high-P resource (bacteria), or body composition might not always directly correlate with nutrient demands of grazers. Although our data cannot differentiate between these explanations, both suggest potential avenues for future empirical and theoretical study.

AB The ability of plants to supply water to their leaves is intimately associated with survival. Water supply to leaves depends on maintaining an intact water column in the xylem from the roots to shoots. Because this hydraulic pathway is under tension, it is vulnerable to breakage through the induction of air emboli. (cavitation). Although the physiological benefit of resistance to water-stress-induced xylem cavitation for desiccation tolerance is clear, there is considerable interspecific variation within and across climates. To understand the adaptive significance of this variation and the potential trade-off with water transport, we compiled a database of 167 species from 50 seed plant families and examined relationships among resistance to xylem cavitation, water transport capacity (as determined by the specific conductivity of xylem [K-S]), and climate. Relationships were evaluated using standard cross-species correlations (r). Because inferences about the adaptive significance of these correlations can be biased by the potential similarity of closely related species, we also analyzed our data using phylogenetically independent contrast correlations (PIC) calculated over a range of alternate seed plant phylogenies. Resistance to cavitation, expressed as the xylem tension at which 50% of hydraulic conductivity was lost (Psi(50)), ranged from -0.18 to -9.9 MPa for angiosperms and from -1.5 to -14.1 MPa for conifers. Conifers were most resistant to cavitation, with mean Psi(50) 80% more negative than angiosperms. In contrast, K-S was 270% higher in angiosperms than conifers. Across all species, cavitation resistance increased with decreasing mean annual precipitation. However, significant phylogenetically independent contrast correlations between Psi(50), and annual precipitation were found within the evergreen angiosperms and conifers but not in the deciduous angiosperms. Thus, the adaptive significance of increased resistance to cavitation as a mechanism of drought tolerance may be of primary importance in evergreen angiosperms and conifers. In contrast, analysis of independent contrasts indicated that K-S increased with decreasing rainfall in deciduous angiosperms, whereas there was no association between K-S and water availability for evergreen angiosperms and conifers. These results suggest that the evolution of increased K-S may be a critical adaptation to water limitation in deciduous angiosperms. Although there was a significant cross-species correlation between Psi(50) and K-S, this relationship was not supported by the independent contrast correlation, suggesting that the evolutionary basis for a trade-off between cavitation resistance and water transport capacity is weak.

AB Forest fragmentation is a common process in forests worldwide, with implications for tree species composition and abundance. In particular, the effects of forest-non-forest edges on microclimate are often profound, usually resulting in increased light available to plants along the forest-non-forest edge. Using dendrochronological techniques, we assessed the effect of edges on the growth rates of four overstory species common in the North Carolina Piedmont: Acer rubrum, Liriodendron tulipifera, Liquidambar styraciflua, and Pinus taeda. Transects from the edge into the forest interior were established on 62 edges of varying aspect and ages in the Duke Forest (Durham, North Carolina, USA). Within a transect, all stems >10 cm in diameter were cored, and their spatial positions relative to the edge were recorded. Along each transect, a set of environmental and edaphic variables was measured including soil texture, soil concentrations of plant nutrients, and percentage of canopy closure. All transects were geo-referenced, and land cover data classified from a time-series of Thematic Mapper images were used to assess the age of each edge. Two species, P. taeda and L. tulipifera, had significant increases in growth rates within 5 in of an edge relative to the forest interior. However, edges explain a substantially smaller portion of the variance in growth rate than soil texture, soil nutrients, and topographically derived variables. Possible, interactions between soil texture and effects of edges on tree growth rate for P. taeda were found, although the interaction was opposite from our hypothesis that increased water availability would increase the positive effect of edges on growth rates. Although the edge effect on tree growth rate is small, as forest fragmentation becomes more prevalent worldwide, even small responses to edge effects by individual trees could have profound effects on regional patterns in carbon fixation and species composition over time.

AB Heterogeneous distributions of resources and organisms are characteristic of most ecosystems, but empirical understanding of the causes and consequences of heterogeneity is limited. We investigated whether predatory fish influenced the heterogeneity (spatial variability) of resources (algae) by modifying the behavior of primary consumers (mayflies). We hypothesized that fish would indirectly increase resource heterogeneity by reducing grazer activity, and that higher densities of grazers would reduce resource heterogeneity only in the absence of fish. We measured the effects of predator cues (brook trout odor) on grazer behavior (Baetis) and algal heterogeneity in mesocosms (similar to 1 m(2)) and in simple natural systems (30-m reaches of adjacent fishless streams). In addition, we measured grazer and algal distributions in complex natural streams that varied in grazer density, presence of fish, and physical conditions. Fish odor altered mayfly grazing behavior (measured using a simple behavioral bioassay) and increased algal heterogeneity (measured by Morisita's index at the scale of individual rocks) in mesocosms and manipulated streams. Furthermore, natural streams with higher grazer densities had lower algal heterogeneity, but only if they were fishless. Interestingly, the presence of brook trout decoupled the link between grazer density and algal heterogeneity in natural streams. These observations indicate that release from the threat of predation or increased densities of grazers can homogenize algal resources in fishless streams. We hypothesize that altered foraging in environments with predatory fish, independent of grazer density, led to increased resource patchiness, possibly by allowing the influence of variation in physical characteristics (e.g., flow and substratum) to predominate or by changing grazer microhabitat use. These results support theoretical predictions that factors affecting primary consumer behavior also alter resource heterogeneity.

AB Initial conditions can generate differences in the biotic composition of spatially disjunct communities, but intense, large-scale perturbations have the potential to reduce or eliminate those historical differences. The latter possibility is of particular concern with respect to coral reefs, which have undergone dramatic changes in the last 25-30 years. This paper reports a case in which two reef systems with different biotic histories were recently perturbed to a single, novel state.
   We compared millennial-scale records of species dominance from reefs in Bahia Almirante, a coastal lagoon in northwestern Panama, to previously published records from reefs in the shelf lagoon of Belize. Reef cores extracted from Bahia Almirante at 5-10 in water depth revealed that the Panamanian reefs were persistently dissimilar from the Belizean reefs for at least 2000-3000 years prior to the last several decades. The Panamanian reefs were dominated continuously by branching finger corals, Porites spp. (primarily P. furcata). Shifts from the Porites-dominated state to dominance by other coral species were rare, were restricted to small areas, and lasted for decades to centuries. The Belizean reefs were dominated continuously by the staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis in the same depth range during the same period. Excursions from the Acropora-dominated state were again rare and spatially localized. Populations of Ac. cervicornis in the Belizean lagoon were nearly extirpated by an outbreak of white-band disease in the late 1980s, and changes in water quality were apparently detrimental to branching Porites in Bahia Almirante in recent decades. These large-scale perturbations caused the two reef systems to converge on a third, historically unprecedented state: dominance by the lettuce coral Agaricia tenuifolia. Ag. tenuifolia possesses life-history attributes and environmental tolerances that enabled it to become dominant in both disturbed ecosystems. Although the two phase shifts to Ag. tenuifolia differed in both their general mechanisms and specific causes, they had the effect of eliminating the salient difference in benthic composition between the Panamanian and Belizean reefs. The changes in species composition thus obliterated the influence of several thousand years of reef history.

AB Many parasites affect the development and survival of offspring. Because passerines exhibit determinate growth, parasites may have lasting effects on phenotypes. The life-history consequences of parasite-induced developmental modifications have rarely been analyzed, and require long-term experimental studies. Here we present the results of a four-year experimental study on the effects of a hematophagous ectoparasite, the hen flea (Ceratophyllus gallinae), on growth, survival, and lifetime reproductive success of nestlings of the Great Tit (Parus major).
   In a design A, half of the nests were heat-treated several times per year to kill parasites, while in the other half, fleas were allowed to immigrate naturally over several years. To allow for the estimation and statistical control of effects due to potentially nonrandom phenotype distribution within this design, a second design, design B, was applied. In design B, all nests were heat treated to kill parasites after nest box occupation, and the subsequent infestation of half of the nests was then randomized in space and time.
   In both designs, the fleas significantly reduced nestling body size but did not significantly affect the probability of nestling recruitment as local breeders. Parasitism reduced the clutch size of the nestlings' first recorded clutch, and of the subsequent clutches, and reduced the total number of recruits produced per nestling over the entire study period. Because body size of the recruited nestlings, both at the end of growth and as recruits, was not significantly different between treatments, the reduced fitness was not an indirect consequence of parasite-modified body size.
   This study provides experimental evidence for parasite-induced effects during growth on survival and development of offspring and shows the consequences of this phenotypic modification on lifetime reproductive success. It shows that parasite-induced effects during growth are important for understanding optimal resource allocation and life-history evolution under parasitism.

AB Processes operating at multiple spatial scales govern the structure and functioning of ecological communities. We conducted a resource manipulation and propagule addition experiment in grassland to evaluate the interaction of local resource availability and propagule pools in governing local-scale plant colonization, biodiversity, and above-ground productivity. The availabilities of establishment microsites and water were manipulated in field plots for two years through the application of experimental soil disturbances and irrigation, respectively. Resource manipulations led to increased invasibility of the community, as predicted by the theory of fluctuating resources. Rates of colonization, enhanced by the sowing of 32 grassland species, increased plant diversity and above-ground productivity, but to a greater extent under conditions of resource enrichment. Although resource enrichment generally increased diversity and productivity, these responses were contingent upon species availability and tended to be more pronounced in the presence of an expanded propagule pool. These findings suggest that biodiversity at the level of the available propagule pool and fluctuations in resources interact to regulate local resident diversity and productivity by determining opportunities for species sorting, by mediating community assembly, and by governing the potential for functional compensation in the community.

AB Juvenile cannibalism may play an important role in population regulation of marine organisms with juvenile stages that aggregate in nursery habitats. I conducted a series of field and laboratory experiments to assess whether three potential density-dependent mechanisms could regulate local recruitment of juvenile shore crabs Carcinus maenas in Swedish nursery areas: (1) intracohort cannibalism, (2) juvenile cannibals' functional response to smaller conspecific prey densities, and (3) juvenile cannibals' numerical effect on prey survival.
   Juvenile cannibals in mesocosms displayed a type III (sigmoid) density-dependent functional response, resulting in significantly higher proportional mortality of smaller conspecifics at high prey densities. Consistent with the laboratory result, cage-enclosed juvenile cannibals in a field experiment eliminated conspecific settlement peaks in mussel habitats and decoupled the relationship between larval and settlement abundance within three days. Density-dependent interference between cannibals in mesocosms decreased per capita predation rates, but conspecific prey mortality still increased with cannibal densities when the abundance of cannibals passed a critical threshold, suggesting that the recruitment success of consecutive cohorts may be negatively correlated. This was supported in a field experiment where the abundance of juvenile cannibals explained 71% of the variation in settlement loss from uncaged mussel habitats. Density-dependent cannibalism also occurred within juvenile cohorts even though food was provided in excess, but the resulting mortality was too low to eliminate initial density: patterns over a 30-day period.
   The results demonstrate that cannibalism between juvenile shore crabs can cause high and strongly density-dependent mortality at natural densities, and that both a functional response and a numerical effect of larger cannibals can regulate the recruitment of new cohorts within days of settlement. A coupling of cannibal and settlement densities on a regional scale is expected to decrease recruitment variability within and between local populations. Moreover, the interaction between the type III functional response, mutual interference, and density-dependent dispersal of cannibals is predicted to reduce cannibalistic rates at low prey and high cannibal densities, respectively, and stabilize local population dynamics in relation to the abundance of juvenile habitats, consistent with field observations of shore crab populations in the study area.

AB Biodiversity can influence ecosystem functioning through changes in the amount of resource use complementary among species. Functional diversity is a measure of biodiversity that aims to quantify resource use complementarity and thereby explain and predict ecosystem functioning. The primary goal of this article is to compare the explanatory power of four measures of functional diversity: species richness, functional group richness, functional attribute diversity, and FD. The secondary goal is to showcase the novel methods required for calculating functional attribute diversity and FD. We find that species richness and functional group richness explain the least variation in a boveground biomass production within and across grassland biodiversity manipulations at six European locations; functional attribute diversity and FD explain greater variation. Reasons for differences in explanatory power are discussed, such as the relatively greater amount of information and fewer assumptions included in functional attribute diversity and FD. We explore the opportunities and limitations of the particular methods we used to calculate functional attribute diversity and FD. These mainly concern how best to select the information used to calculate them.

AB Individual genotypes, phenotypes, or species of plants can vary in their effects on herbivore population dynamics. In this study I used a simulation model to explore how the distribution of plant quality in a plant population affects the population dynamics of insect herbivores feeding,on those plants. The model considers an herbivore population moving among patches (plants) with differing parameters for growth and carrying capacity. Observed population sizes across all patches were compared to the expectation that, if variance in parameters had no effect, population size should equal the sum of the carrying capacities of all plants. Results showed that variance in K alone, or in r and K together, strongly affected herbivore population size; increasing variance led to progressively stronger effects. The direction of the deviation of herbivore population size from the expectation in the absence of variance could be positive, negative, or both for different combinations of variance in r and K. Increasing skew also increased the deviation of observed population sizes from the expectation. Herbivore mobility increased the effect of variance in patch (plant) quality, whereas herbivore selectivity decreased the effects of variance by decreasing herbivore movement. These results are consistent with observations from agricultural studies that polycultures can either increase or decrease herbivore population sizes relative to monocultures.

AB One commonly used PVA (population viability analysis) approach applies a diffusion approximation (DA) of population growth to time series of abundance data to estimate population parameters and various metrics of extinction risk. The simplest versions of this PVA assume density-independent population growth, an assumption that is commonly called into question for populations experiencing self-limitation. Using time series data generated from simulations of populations limited by three commonly used forms of density dependence (ceiling, Beverton-Holt, and Ricker) we asked the question: "When do simple density-independent PVA models provide useful guidelines for prioritizing extinction risk despite density-dependence inherent in the underlying real populations?"
   Simple DA methods severely underestimated maximum growth rates (mu(max)) used to generate time series data for all three forms of density dependence. These methods also underestimated the intrinsic environmental variability in growth rates, or process error (sigma(2)), for the ceiling model, but overestimated this parameter for the Beverton-Holt and Ricker models. Despite misestimation of the intrinsic parameters, the estimated probabilities of 50% and 75% declines were highly correlated with the observed probabilities for populations growing with a ceiling (coefficients of correlation, or R-2 = 0.87-0.93). DA methods were less accurate for populations exhibiting more complex forms of density dependence (R-2 = 0.61-0.79). Although correlations between observed and estimated risks were high, bias (e.g., over and underestimation) was extensive. Estimated probabilities of 50% declines were typically much lower (overly optimistic) than observed probabilities of the same decline. By contrast, accuracy increased substantially for predictions of 75% decline, and the "optimistic" bias was replaced by conservative bias (overestimates of risk).
   Regardless of the form of density dependence, estimates of risk were least accurate when populations were recovering rapidly but were much more accurate when most needed by conservation practitioners: when the population fluctuated near its carrying capacity, recovered slowly to this abundance level, or declined toward extinction. Finally, when we classified risk in broad categories (e.g., extremely low, low, moderate, high, and extremely high), DA methods correctly or conservatively estimated the risk of a 75% decline for >85% of the parameter combinations, regardless of the form of density dependence followed by the real population.

AB Many ecological phenomena are characterized by context dependency, and the relationship between diversity and productivity is no exception. We examined the relationship between macroalgal diversity,and nutrient availability by evaluating the effects of reduced nutrients and their subsequent replacement via local-scale nutrient loading in tide pools. Macroalgae in Oregon coast high-intertidal pools have evolved in a nitrate-rich upwelling ecosystem, but instead of settling on low-intertidal reefs (where algae are often immersed in nutrient-rich nearshore waters) these individuals have colonized high-zone pools, where they are isolated from the ocean for extended periods of time and are subjected to extended periods, of nitrate depletion. In some pools, this nutrient stress was ameliorated by a positive interaction: the excretion of ammonium by invertebrates. We conducted experimental manipulations to quantify invertebrate-mediated ammonium loading and macroalgal ammonium uptake in high-intertidal pools. Variation in tide pool volume and invertebrate biomass created a gradient of local-scale nutrient inputs, allowing us to address the relationship between nitrogen loading and algal diversity. Slow-growing species tolerant of low nitrogen availability were joined by fast-growing species with higher nitrogen requirements in pools with higher ammonium loading rates. A fourfold increase in the ammonium loading rate was associated with a doubling in the number of macroalgal species, and macroalgal assemblages in more species-rich pools were characterized by higher rates of biomass-specific ammonium uptake. These patterns contrast with productivity-diversity relationships in terrestrial systems, where local-scale nutrient enrichments generally result in reduced producer diversity due to displacement of subordinate species by aggressive competitors. Our data suggest that the effect of enrichment on diversity is context-dependent. Each ecosystem has a critical level of nutrient availability, determined by the level of nutrients typically available in that system. Below this critical level, local-scale nutrient additions increase diversity, but above it, diversity declines with enrichment.

AB We develop and test models for the population dynamics of species that undergo regular alternations of generations between independent, free-living, haploid and diploid phases. The models are patterned after the dioecious, haploid-diploid lifecycle of many marine algae. If the two phases have equal demographic rates, all models (with or without density dependence) predict a stable distribution with a ratio of root2:1 (similar to60% haploids and 40% diploids). We find that observable deviations from this distribution can occur when the demographic rates (mortality, fecundity) between phases vary widely. Field surveys of three macroalgal species with independent, free-living haploids and diploids, Mazzaella flaccida, M. laminarioides, and M. splendens, reveal a consistent pattern of haploid dominance that significantly exceeds this null model expectation (72%, 76%, and 66%, respectively). These species also exhibit significant variation in haploid frequency among sites. We estimated the per capita fecundity and mortality rates for each phase of both M. flaccida and M. laminarioides and used this information to address two basic questions: (1) Which parameter better explains the overall high relative haploid abundance for each species? and (2) Which parameter better explains the variation in relative haploid abundance among sites?
   Differences in haploid and diploid mortality rates did not explain the high relative abundance of haploids for either M. flaccidet or M. laminarioides. However, differences in fecundity rates between phases were consistent with the high relative abundance of haploids for M. flaccida; diploids usually had significantly higher per capita fecundity rates than haploids. For M. laminarioides, there were no significant differences in fecundity rates between phases.
   For M. flaccida, among-site variation in relative abundance of haploids can be explained by differences in mortality rates. The relative abundance of haploids was positively correlated with the ratio of diploid:haploid mortality rates; the sites with the highest ratio of diploid:haploid mortality had the highest percentage of haploids. Differences in mortality rates for M. laminarioides, and fecundity rates for M. flaccida and M. laminarioides, could not explain the observed variation in haploid abundance among sites.

AB Whereas it is acknowledged that the C:N:P stoichiometry of consumers and their resources affects both the structure and the function of food webs, and eventually influences broad-scale processes such as global carbon cycles, the mechanistic basis for the variation in stoichiometry has not yet been fully explored. Empirical evidence shows that the specific growth rate is positively related to RNA concentration both between and within taxa in both unicellular and multicellular organisms. Since RNA is rich in P and constitutes a substantial part of the, total P in organisms, a high growth rate is also connected with a high P content. We argue that the reason for this pattern is that the growth of all biota is closely linked with their protein synthesis rate, and thus with the concentration of ribosomal RNA. Dynamic energy budget theory supports the positive relationship between RNA and specific growth rate in microorganisms, whereas the predictions concerning multicellulars only partially agrees with the observed pattern. In a simple model of consumer growth, we explore the consequences of various allocation patterns of RNA; protein, carbohydrates/lipids, and other biochemical constituents on organism potential growth rate and C:N:P stoichiometry. According to the model the percentage of N, and especially percentage of P per dry mass increases with increasing specific growth rate. Furthermore, the model suggests that macromolecule allocation patterns and thus N:P stoichiometry are allowed to differ substantially at low growth rates whereas the stoichiometry at high growth rates is much more constricted at low N:R The model fits empirical data reasonably well, but it is also acknowledged that complex life cycles and associated physiological constraints may result in other patterns. We also use a similar approach of modeling organism growth from basic biochemical principles to illustrate fundamental connections among biochemical allocation and C:N stoichiometry in autotroph production, which is based on allocation patterns between carbohydrates and rubisco. Similar to the RNA-protein model, macromolecular composition and C:N ratios are more constrained at high than at low growth rates. The models and the empirical data together suggest that organism growth is tightly linked with the organisms' biochemical and elemental composition. The stoichiometry of growth impinges on nutrient cycles and carbon fluxes at the ecosystem level. Thus, focus on the biological basis of organism C:N:P stoichiometry can mechanistically connect growth strategy and biochemical and cellular mechanisms of biota to major ecological consequences.

AB Ecological interactions are often difficult to observe or manipulate directly, making it a challenge to evaluate competing hypotheses in natural systems. Semiparametric models can provide a powerful inverse approach to infer population processes from observational data because they allow an ecologist to model aspects of a system that are known, but allow the data to "speak for themselves" with regard to aspects that are unknown. However, (st)age- structured semiparametric models are plagued with demographic instabilities that can cause different combinations of interactions, including competing hypotheses, to predict the observed pattern equally well. We developed and tested two new solutions to these demographic instabilities that expand the range of life histories for which (st) age- structured semiparametric inverse methods can be used. We begin by reviewing the range of inverse methods, from fully parametric models in which the governing functions are completely specified, to semiparametric models that replace these functions with nonparametric curves. We illustrate how the demographic instabilities emerge and indicate the requirements that any successful solution must satisfy. Existing solutions use constraints that may conflict with ecological processes and cause strong biases in the inferred rates. Our first solution uses a new statistical constraint that is less restrictive than previous methods. Our second solution is a hybrid approach that supplements the less restrictive statistical constraint with a few estimates of the interaction rates. This hybrid approach provides a way of distinguishing among dynamical mechanisms without imposing constraints on ecological relationships.

AB Long-distance bird migration is expensive, and individuals in prime condition are therefore expected to arrive at the breeding grounds earlier than the average individual. in the population. We tested whether arrival date during spring migration was associated with low parasite burden and strong T-cell-dependent immune response in populations of the transequatorially migrating Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica from Denmark, Italy, and Spain. Male Barn Swallows with heavy infestations of the chewing louse Hirundoecus malleus L. arrived later than other males, whereas that was not the case for females. This negative relationship remained after controlling the relationship between parasite load and arrival for tail length. Infection with blood parasites of the species Haemoproteus prognei was associated with delayed arrival in the Spanish population, which was the only one with a high prevalence of blood parasites. High intensities of infestation with a commensal feather mite were associated with early arrival by females, but also by males when the independent, relationship between tail length and intensity of mite infestation was controlled statistically. Experimental manipulation of nest infestation with the hematophagous mite Ornithonyssus bursa Berlese affected the arrival date of adult,males, but not of females in the following year, with arrival date being inversely related to the experimental mite population size. Males with strong T-cell responses arrived earlier than males with weak responses, independent of their tail length in two of three populations, but there was no significant relationship in females. These findings are in accordance with predictions based on the hypothesis that bird migration is dependent on condition, with individuals in prime condition arriving early.

AB The costs of self-fertilization were evaluated for the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera. Macrocystis, like other kelps, has a biphasic life history in which the dispersal stage is the IN spore generation. Once spores settle, they grow into sedentary and microscopic male or female gametophytes, which produce sperm and eggs. Fertilization ensues, and the resultant 2N sporophyte, the spore-producing form, grows rapidly to a height of LIP to 25 m. Based on previous empirical studies and modeling field Surveys, the potential for self-fertilization is expected to be high. largely due to the shape and extent of spore dispersal distributions. The costs of self-fertilization were assessed with laboratory and field experiments over the entire life history of the sporophyte stage. There was no evidence for self-incompatibility, and fitness was dramatically lower in selfed compared to outcrossed individuals. In addition, there was evidence that costs were more severe under intraspecific competition With outcrossed individuals. The demonstrated severity of the consequences of self-fertilization Suggests a species that typically outcrosses (at least under the assumption that costs result from rare recessive deleterious alleles). However, costs were more pronounced ill later life history phases, Suggesting routine self-fertilization. One implication of significant levels of self-fertilization in Macrocystis is a sort of inbreeding-mediated localized population senescence, leading to striking oscillations in Populations, a pattern seen in many Californian kelp beds.

AB The impact of multiple factors on the expression of phenotypic plasticity has been poorly studied. The simultaneous presence of factors inducing diverging responses may result either in a trade-off between the responses or in a hierarchy of responses. Inducible defenses offer a suitable model to investigate these alternatives. Inducible defenses evolve in response to variability in predation risk. Here, we investigated the impact of the nonlethal presence of both pursuing (fish, Gasterosteus aculeatus) and sit-and-wait (dragonfly larvae, Aeshna cyanea) predators on tadpole morphology in two frogs (Rana dalmatina and R. ridibunda). Predation tests showed that Aeshna were the more dangerous of the two predators for the tadpoles of both species. In both species, induced responses differed according to predator type. In the presence of fish, tadpoles invested in both tail muscle depth and tail length. In the presence of dragonfly larvae, the investment was made in tail fin depth. When faced with the two types of predators simultaneously, the response was similar to that expressed in the presence of Aeshna alone, suggesting a hierarchy of response according to predation risk. Such a hierarchy of response could result from selection against the phenotype induced by the other predator.

AB Mammalian herbivores can carry out multiple tasks without interrupting food processing, but this possibility is not considered in existing foraging models. We develop a mechanistic functional response to account for herbivores' ability to search for their next food bite and walk away from competitors while chewing vegetation. We demonstrate how the possibility of multi-tasking can buffer intake rate from competition and vigilance. The functional response of herbivores can be density independent until a threshold of competitors is reached in the food patch, and only then does it become density dependent. Herbivores also should be capable of maintaining food intake rate, despite important resource depletion in the foraging patch. The possibility of animal movements during food processing offers herbivores opportunities for cost-free vigilance. When individuals find their next bite before they have finished chewing the current bite, the remaining chewing time becomes "spare time" that could be spent in vigilance without reducing food intake rate. Modeling of optimal vigilance demonstrates that such cost-free vigilance might importantly alter expected patterns of scanning by mammalian herbivores. Assuming that interference increases with competitor density, spare time available for scanning should decrease as the number of herbivores in a food patch increases. Foraging constraints on food intake thus can provide a mechanistic explanation for the commonly observed decline in herbivore vigilance with increasing group size.

AB Phenotypically plastic defenses are strategies to reduce predation risk in variable environments. Predator-induced formations of protective devices in cladocerans are prominent examples of phenotypically plastic defenses. To understand the adaptive value of a defense, it is better to investigate its effects in a multipredator context, instead of merely concentrating on a two-species interaction. Small cladocerans such as Daphnia cucullata are prey items for many aquatic invertebrate predators and thus comprise a useful model system to investigate defenses and their effects. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the helmets of Daphnia cucullata are inducible with chemical cues from different kinds of predators and that they act as a generalized defense offering protection against several predators, each using a different hunting strategy.
   Results from our induction experiment show that chemical cues released from Chaoborus flavicans, Leptodora kindtii, and Cyclops sp. induce significantly longer helmets and tail spines and thus act as proximate factors for cyclomorphosis in Daphnia cucullata. Our predation experiments revealed that the induced morphological changes offered protection against each of the predators tested. Interestingly, the protective mechanisms and the prey size classes which were protected differed between predator systems.
   Our results suggest that phenotypic plasticity in Daphnia cucullata evolved as a "diffuse" coevolution against different invertebrate predators which selectively feed on small prey items. The additive benefits may increase the adaptive value and thus facilitate the evolution and persistence of this generalized defense.

AB Wild tobacco growing in a field near experimentally clipped sagebrush became more resistant to herbivores than tobacco plants near unclipped sagebrush. Here, we asked whether eavesdropping on sagebrush is a common phenomenon. Do three other forb species that grow near sagebrush experience less herbivory when their sagebrush neighbors are clipped experimentally? Similarly, we asked if sagebrush becomes more resistant when conspecific neighbors are clipped. We found that levels of damage to leaves of lomatium, lupine, and valerian were unaffected by experimental clipping of neighboring sagebrush. These three forbs share many generalist herbivores with sagebrush, as does wild tobacco. Sagebrush individuals near clipped neighbors experienced approximately half the leaf loss to herbivores over the summer as plants with unclipped neighbors. Most of this herbivory was caused by generalist grasshoppers and mammals. Success of a chrysomelid beetle that specializes on sagebrush was unaffected by clipping neighboring sagebrush. These results indicate that communication between sagebrush and tobacco is not a unique phenomenon since sagebrush also responded when neighbors were clipped. In contrast, other plant species generally respond less strongly to cues than does tobacco, indicating that not all species respond to relatively high levels of jasmonate in their environments. Eavesdropping may be restricted to those species, like tobacco, that are strongly inducible and to those species, like sagebrush, that release high concentrations of cues.

AB Despite recent interest in the non-sugar components of floral nectar, nearly nothing is known about the ecological importance and phylogenetic distribution of scented nectar. If present, the scent of nectar would provide an honest signal to nectar-feeding animals. Nectar odors may directly impact plant reproductive fitness, through pollinator attraction or deterrence of nectar robbers and florivores. In addition, nectar odors may indirectly impact plant fitness through antimicrobial activity, pleiotropic interactions with plant defense, and communication with predators and parasitoids. The literature provides only circumstantial evidence for scented nectar, through the study of bee honey odors. Here I confirm the presence of scent in the nectar of four out of seven angiosperm species sampled with solid-phase micro-extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In Abelia x grandiflora and Hedychium coronarium, nectar odors are a hydrophilic subset of the compounds emitted by surrounding floral tissues, suggesting passive absorption by the nectar standing crop. Sucrose solution applied to the petals of a nectarless flower, Magnolia grandiflora, absorbed a hydrophilic subset of scent compounds after one hour, lending support to this hypothesis. Nectar from Oenothera primiveris and Agave palmeri contained unique scent compounds compared to the floral tissues. The presence of fermentation volatiles in A. palmeri nectar suggests a dynamic role for yeast in its floral biology. These data highlight the need for systematic studies on the distribution and mechanistic importance of scented floral nectar to plant-animal interactions.

AB We estimated the population consequences to an inferior competitor from interactions with a superior competitor that also is an indirect mutualist. The competitors are two damselfishes, three-spot dascyllus (Dascyllus trimaculatus) and orange-fin anemonefish (Amphiprion chrysopterus), that vie for shelter space on a sea anemone (Heteractis magnifica). Anemonefish have an indirect positive effect on dascyllus populations due to the faster growth that anemones experience when they are occupied by Amphiprion. A long-term experiment revealed that anemonefish depressed dascyllus density (number of individuals per area of anemone per area of reef) more than abundance (number of individuals per reef area) because anemonefish caused a greater net increase in anemone surface area. We calculated that the effect of competition alone would depress dascyllus populations to near zero. The indirect positive interaction compensated for similar to67% of the direct negative effect. Failure to consider the indirect positive interaction in this system would lead to a gross underestimate of the strength of competition, and would not reveal the critical importance of the indirect mutualism in maintaining local populations of the inferior competitor. Indirect mutualisms are common in nature, and assessing how they mediate effects of other processes is crucial to a more accurate understanding of natural communities.

AB This article asks under what conditions and to what extent periodic variation in the growth rate of a single shared limiting resource facilitates the coexistence of two competing consumers that differ in having linear vs. nonlinear responses to that resource. The analysis explores the effects of four factors on the range of consumer characteristics that allow coexistence: (1) whether resource growth is biotic or abiotic; (2) the efficiency of the consumers in reducing the resource population; (3) the rapidity of the demographic response of the consumers to changes in resource density; and (4) the period and amplitude of the periodicity in resource growth. Coexistence of two competitors differing greatly in the linearity of their responses is most likely when (1) resource growth is biotic and (2) the consumers are relatively inefficient. The effects on coexistence of the third and fourth factors can be more complicated, particularly when the resource is biotic. However, in most cases coexistence occurs over a wider range of conditions when the linear consumer has a more rapid numerical response than the nonlinear consumer and when the period of environmental fluctuation is much longer than the minimum doubling time of the consumer populations. If the resource is biotic, consumer-resource cycles can be produced by the nonlinear consumer, and environmental cycles may either interfere with or reinforce these, contracting or expanding the conditions allowing coexistence. However, the interaction of endogenous cycles and periodic variation in resource growth generally has highly nonadditive effects on coexistence. These findings help explain why few previous experimental studies have demonstrated coexistence due to the relative nonlinearity of consumer responses.

AB Factorial manipulations of biodiversity on different trophic levels can reveal the mechanisms that govern how biomass is partitioned within and among trophic levels. Here I report results of a laboratory microcosm experiment crossing eight algal compositions (seven monocultures and a polyculture of all seven species) with five ciliate herbivore compositions (no herbivores, three monocultures, and a polyculture of all three species). Microcosms allowed comparison of short-, medium-, and long-term (dozens of generations) results. Niche differentiation allowed competing algae to coexist in the absence of herbivores. Surprisingly, algal polycultures produced more biomass than the most productive monocultures only in the medium term. A temporally variable relationship between the productivity of diverse and depauparate algal assemblages might reflect changes in competitive mechanisms over time, and/or transient dynamics, and contrasts with the predictions of simple competition models.
   Herbivores had little effect on total algal biomass or algal composition, in part because of the lack of a strong trade-off between algal competitive ability and edibility. Increasing algal diversity significantly reduced the biomass of one herbivore, apparently because competition from inedible algae reduced the productivity of edible algae. A negative effect of inedible algae on herbivore biomass accords with simple food web theory and indicates that increasing diversity on one trophic level can have negative consequences for other trophic levels.
   Herbivores varied little in their abilities to graze different algae. Total algal biomass, algal composition, and total herbivore biomass were independent of herbivore diversity and composition, and algal composition had only minor effects the outcome of competition among herbivores. However, the outcome of herbivore competition was predictably asymmetrical. indicating that herbivores varied in other ways, such as ability to consume alternative food sources (bacteria). Further factorial manipulations of diversity and trophic structure are needed to improve understanding of the likely consequences of species loss in food webs. These experiments should last as long as possible, since the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem properties may depend as much on when the relationship is measured as on species identity and the degree of niche differentiation among species.

AB Models based on generalized plant physiological theory represent a promising approach for describing vegetation responses to environmental drivers on large scales but must be tested for their ability to reproduce features of real vegetation. We tested the capability of a generalized vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS) to simulate vegetation structural and compositional dynamics under various disturbance regimes at the transition between prairie, northern hardwoods, and boreal forest in the Great Lakes region of the United States.
   LPJ-GUESS combines detailed representations of population dynamics as commonly used in forest gap models with the same mechanistic representations of plant physiological processes as adopted by a dynamic global vegetation model (the Lund-Potsdam-Jena [LPJ] model), which has been validated from the stand to the global scale. The model does not require site-specific calibration. The required input data are. information on climate, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and soil texture class, as 'well as information on generally recognized species traits (broad-leaved vs. needle-leaved, general climatic range, two fire-resistance classes, shade-tolerance class, and maximum longevity).
   Model predictions correspond closely to observed patterns of vegetation dynamics and standing biomass at an old-growth eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis)/hardwood forest (Sylvania Wilderness, Michigan), an old-growth forest remnant from the "Great Lakes Pines Forest" (Itasca State Park, Minnesota), and a presettlement savanna (Cedar Creek Natural History Area, Minnesota). At all three sites, disturbance (wind or fire) strongly controls species composition and stand biomass.
   The model could be used to simulate vegetation dynamics on a regional basis or under past or future climates and atmospheric CO, levels, without a need for reparameterization.

AB While two cyprinid fishes introduced from nearby drainages have become widespread and abundant in the Eel River of northwestern California, a third nonindigenous cyprinid has remained largely confined to less than or equal to25 km of one major tributary. (the Van Duzen River) for at least 15 years. The downstream limit of this species, speckled dace, does not appear to correspond with any thresholds or steep gradients in abiotic conditions, but it lies near the upstream limits of three other fishes: coastrange sculpin, prickly sculpin, and nonindigenous Sacramento pikeminnow. We conducted a laboratory stream experiment to explore the potential for emergent multiple predator effects to influence biotic resistance in this situation. Sculpins in combination with Sacramento pikeminnow caused greater mortality of speckled dace than predicted based on their separate effects. In contrast to speckled dace, 99% of sculpin survived trials with Sacramento pikeminnow, in part because sculpin usually occupied benthic cover units while Sacramento pikeminnow occupied the water column. A 10-fold difference in benthic cover availability did not detectably influence biotic interactions in the experiment. The distribution of speckled dace in the Eel River drainage may be limited by two predator taxa with very different patterns of habitat use and a shortage of alternative habitats.

AB Dynamic energy budget models relate phenomena at many levels of ecological organization and can provide quantitative links from individual physiology to population, community, and ecosystem dynamics. A prerequisite for making these links is an empirically tested model of growth and reproduction for individual organisms in a temporally variable environment. We construct a model that is applicable to organisms with indeterminate growth. By applying a recent statistical approach attributable to S. N. Wood, we use the model to infer the size dependence of feeding rates and of energy allocation to growth vs. reproduction for Daphnia from new laboratory data on growth and egg production. The implied feeding rates are consistent with independent measurements. With one additional assumption, respiration rates can be predicted; they scale with size in a manner consistent with previous measurements of respiration allometry. These findings support the use of inverse methods to determine physiologically based functions and parameters for subsequent use in population and ecosystem models.

AB We analyzed a data set accumulated over a 12-year period subsequent to the catastrophic disturbance of a rain forest by a hurricane. We analyzed the data to determine whether observed trajectories correspond to expectations from an equilibrium or nonequilibrium model of community structure. The equilibrium case, implying a single basin of attraction, suggests that trajectories should become ever more similar over time. The nonequilibrium case, implying multiple basins of attraction, suggests the opposite. The data from this particular forest, located on the eastern seaboard of Nicaragua, strongly support the multiple basin hypothesis, and thus the nonequilibrium model.

AB Increased nitrogen (N) mobilization and export from terrestrial forest ecosystems following canopy herbivory have been well documented, though the mechanism behind the loss is knot clear. Because carbon (C) and N dynamics are closely linked, herbivore activity may also affect C distribution. We initiated a replicated mini-ecosystem experiment to test the hypothesis that insect frass (feces) influences soil C and N dynamics following insect defoliation. One hundred and sixty red oak (Quercus rubra) saplings were transplanted to seven-gallon (26.5-L) pots with soil and litter from the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory (CWT) (Otto, North Carolina, USA) and overwintered in experimental pot stands. During the 2002 growing season, trees were subjected to a 3 X 2 factorial experimental design with three damage groups (herbivore, mechanical, "undamaged") and two frass depositions (frass, no frass).
   Frass deposition increased soil total C. total N, and the soil NH4+ pool. Leachate NO, export also increased following frass additions. We suggest that herbivore frass mobilizes Sufficient C and N to affect soil pools and N exports though abiotic factors may influence the ultimate fate Of the nutrients in frass. In addition, herbivory increased soil respiration and decreased total soil N relative to "undamaged" controls independent of frass deposition. While we discuss four possible mechanisms for this observation, we hypothesize that the increased soil respiration results from enhanced root-exudate C and subsequent microbial oxidation. This mechanism has implications for C sequestration and N retention in forest soils. In addition. the effects of mechanical damage consistently did not match those of real herbivory, suggesting that differential responses of Q. rubra to damage types also may affect soil nutrient dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the feeding activity of insect herbivores can have direct and indirect effects on the cycling of C and N within the season of defoliation.

AB This study compared annual and growing-season in situ soil respiration and soil C cycling in paired juniper woodland and C-4-dominated grassland sites in eastern Kansas (USA) to determine if, Under similar edaphic and regional climate conditions, vegetation change alters soil CO2 dynamics. We found marked differences in soil respiration related to vegetation: Growing season mean woodland soil respiration rates (4.6 mumoles(.) m (2.)s (1)) averaged 38% less than paired grassland sites. Soil Moisture did not explain the difference in soil respiration between woodlands and grasslands. Soil temperatures at the 10-cm depth were 5degreesC cooler in woodlands during the growing season and significantly different between woodlands and grasslands throughout the year, explaining most of the low soil respiration in woodlands. However, there were Subtle intrinsic differences in the response of soil respiration to temperature between woodlands and grasslands: Woodland and grassland respiration response was significantly different at the P = 0.05 level, also indicated by a grassland Q(10) of 2.4 compared to 2.2 in woodlands. We found no significant differences between woodlands and grasslands in long-term (82-week) laboratory incubations of potentially mineralizable soil C and short-term incubations for microbial biomass C. Similarly, root biomass (lid not differ between woodlands and grasslands and Could not explain the lower in Situ woodland soil respiration. Thus, vegetation-mediated reduction it) soil temperature under the canopy explained much of the lower in Situ woodland soil respiration. Lower soil respiration in the woodland resulted in an annual flux of 533.6 (+/-21.7) compared to 858.4 (+/-14.5) g C(.)m (2.)yr (1) in grasslands, nearly 38% lower in the woodland (means +/- 1 SE). Assuming root respiration is 50% of soil respiration. we estimate that the turnover of woodland soil C stocks may be slowed by 15 years relative to grassland. This suggests that, if jumper expansion (now occurring across nearly 5 million hectares in the Great Plains) proceeds to canopy closure. annual Soil C flux may be potentially reduced by as Much as 19 X 10(6) Mg of C below C flux rates that occurred historically from tallgrass prairie soils.

AB Life histories may show phases of both plasticity and canalization in response to feeding rate. Models for life history canalization and plasticity postulate a threshold for initiation of canalized developmental events. Some models postulate adaptive plasticity, whereas others postulate nonadaptive plasticity that results from environmental modulation of fixed development. These models have been tested by changing feeding rate at various times and determining when timing of life history events becomes unresponsive to those changes. This approach has been criticized because putative thresholds are usually not known. We use an alternative experimental design to test models of reproductive plasticity and canalization, and to estimate thresholds, in the grasshopper Romalea microptera. We develop mathematical models for published verbal models that predict how life history timing changes with feeding rate. Alternative models predict distinct relationships of time to oviposition vs. mean food intake that we test via experimental manipulation of food intake and nonlinear regressions. Regressions yield estimates of both the threshold and the duration of post-threshold development. A model postulating a fixed threshold and canalized post-threshold development provides the best, most parsimonious fit to data for this grasshopper. Thus, the simplest model, postulating no adaptive variation in development, is supported, a result that is consistent with previous experiments on this system using changing feeding rates. We use the estimate of the threshold (in units of food eaten) and measurements of hemolymph protein content to estimate the threshold in units of physiologically relevant storage. These results elucidate the structure of reproductive plasticity in this system and how this alternative experimental approach can provide testable predictions of developmental thresholds for further experiments on life history plasticity and canalization.

AB Few studies have examined the influence of natural disturbances, such as windthrow, on soil organic matter formation, stabilization, and loss in soils. In shallow (< 1 m) mountain forest soils, windthrow activity may result in the redistribution and mixing of mineral and organic soil horizons down to bedrock. We studied the patterns of soil carbon, the dominant constituent of soil organic matter, in watersheds along a windthrow disturbance sequence in a mountainous temperate rain forest in southeast Alaska. Our objectives were (1) to evaluate the influence of windthrow and illuviation on the accumulation of soil organic carbon in mineral horizons and (2) to compare the forms of soil organic matter that have accumulated. Soils were described, and the thickness of the major organic and mineral horizons was measured, every 5 in along transects in three watersheds with contrasting windthrow histories. A subset of the soil description sites was randomly selected and then sampled to determine the quantity and quality of soil carbon. Mineral soil samples were physically fractionated based on particle density. Total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), natural N-15 and C-13 abundance, micromorphologic analysis (using scanning electron microscopy), and solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were used to compare soil organic matter pools in the three watersheds. The Bh horizon heavy-fraction (>1.65 g/cml) C pools decreased from 25 Mg/ha in the least disturbed watershed to 3 Mg/ha in the most disturbed watershed; whereas light-fraction C pools were similar (4-6 Mg/ha) across all watersheds. Soil C stocks decreased from 216 Mg/ha in the least disturbed watershed to 157 Mg/ha in the most disturbed watersheds. Evidence was found that mobile organic carbon transported in soil water accumulated in mineral horizons principally through sorption to mineral particles. Strong association with mineral particles was greater in the thicker, presumably older, illuvial horizons. We found light amorphous material in some of these thicker illuvial horizons, suggesting that mobile organic carbon may have been immobilized through flocculation of metal-bearing organic acids. Watersheds that experienced more intense soil mixing from windthrow had lower levels of strongly humified soil organic matter, and more in a partially decomposed particulate form.

AB The literature on biological invasions has principally focused on understanding the ecological controls and consequences of invasions. Invading populations, however, often experience rapid evolutionary changes associated with or soon after their introduction. Ecological and evolutionary processes can, therefore, potentially interact over relatively short timescales.
   A number of recent studies have begun to document these interactions and their effect on short-term invasion dynamics: (1) The degree to which founder effects, drift, and inbreeding alter the genetic composition of introduced populations is mediated by migration and dispersal patterns, the population dynamics of founding populations, and life history. The genetic changes associated with founding can themselves feed back on population dynamics and life history. (2) Patterns of human-mediated dispersal and landscape change can influence the frequency and pattern of hybridization, which in turn can alter invasion dynamics. These altered invasion dynamics can influence the frequency and pattern of subsequent hybridization and introgression. (3) Strong selection can rapidly generate ecotypic specialization. Dispersal patterns, founder effects, genetic system, and life history influence the rate of local adaptation, its persistence, and its distribution in a landscape. (4) Introduced populations are subject to selection on life history traits and can serve as selective pressure on the life history traits of native populations. Life history evolution in both natives and aliens can influence ecological interactions and population dynamics, which in turn can influence the evolution of life history.
   Too few studies have investigated these interactions to definitively assess their overall generality or to determine how the.-relative interaction strength of ecology and evolution varies across taxa or ecosystems. However, the studies that do exist report interactions from a wide breadth of taxa and from all stages in the invasion process. This suggests that ecological-evolutionary interactions may have a more pervasive influence on contemporary invasion dynamics than previously appreciated, and that at least in some situations an explicit understanding of the contemporary co-influence of ecology and evolution can produce more effective and predictive control strategies.

   RESPONSES
AB Many organisms have evolved morphological and behavioral traits that reduce their susceptibility to predation. However, few studies have explicitly investigated the relationships between defensive traits and susceptibility. Here we demonstrate a negative correlation between morphological defenses and behavioral avoidance across several species of marine gastropod that is linked to vulnerability to crab predation. Snails that had relatively taller shell spires (high aspect ratio) showed greater responsiveness when exposed to predation cues than did species with disc-like shells (low aspect ratio). Our results suggest that the snail species most vulnerable to predation compensated by showing the highest levels of behavioral avoidance, and hence may be at a disadvantage in competition with less vulnerable species. This has important implications because the behavioral response of herbivorous gastropods to predation cues may play a central role in structuring rocky intertidal communities through trait-mediated indirect effects.

AB Fire severity, frequency, and extent are expected to change dramatically in coming decades in response to changing climatic conditions, superimposed on the adverse cumulative effects of various human-related disturbances on ecosystems during the past 100 years or more. To better gauge these expected changes, knowledge of climatic and human influences on past fire regimes is essential. We characterized the temporal and spatial properties of fire regimes in ponderosa pine forests of the southern San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado by collecting 175 fire-scarred tree samples from nine sites across a wide range of topographic settings. All tree rings and fire scars were dated using standard dendrochronological techniques. Fire-free intervals were statistically modeled using the Weibull distribution to provide quantitative measures that characterized the historical range of variation in pre-EuroAmerican fire regimes.
   Fires during our reference period were more frequent in the low elevation ponderosa pine forests (6-10 yr) than in the high elevation, mixed conifer forests (18 28 yr). Fires at lower elevations were predominantly low-severity, isolated fires. Fires during some years (e.g., 1748) were spatially extensive throughout the entire mountain range. Intervals that delimited significantly long fire-free periods ranged from 10-19 yr (low elevation) to 2750 yr (high elevation). Fire histories were similar between the eastern and western portions of the mountain range, although we found significant evidence of topographic isolation on fire regimes at one site. Pre-1880 fires primarily occurred in the dormant season, and we found no temporal changes in past fire seasonality. We found no compelling evidence that Native Americans influenced fire regimes in our study sites.
   We found a hiatus in fire occurrence between 1750 and 1770 that we believe was likely related to weakened El Nino-Southern Oscillation activity, an extended series of cool-phase Pacific Decadal Oscillation events, and weakened monsoonal moisture, all possibly entrained in an invasive air mass typical of locations that are more northerly. In addition, pre-1880 fires occurred during years of severe drought, conditioned by above average moisture conditions in preceding years. The 20th century is characterized by a near complete absence of fires (fire-free interval of >100 yr), suggesting future wildfires may be more widespread and ecologically severe compared to pre-1880 fires.

AB Plants employ nectar for two distinct functions. Floral nectar has traditionally been viewed in the context of pollination. Extrafloral nectar on the other hand, can act as an indirect defense,. allowing the plant to recruit predators and parasitoids. Whereas this makes for a clear-cut categorization, in reality the functions may not be so discrete. Extrafloral nectar may serve a role in pollination, while floral nectar can be utilized by predators and parasitoids and thus can contribute to plant defense. Here we use the optimal defense theory to generate predictions with respect to allocation patterns of defensive nectar. These predictions are then tested using novel data on the production patterns of bracteal and foliar nectar in cotton, Gossypium hirsutum.
   Bracteal nectar production shows a distinct peak on the day of anthesis, followed by a prolonged secretion during fruit maturation. This suggests that bracteal nectaries function in pollination as well as defense. Constitutive nectar production at the bracteal nectaries exceeds foliar nectar secretion by a factor of between 80 and 110. Whereas nectar production at foliar nectaries is induced following herbivore damage to leaves, bracteal nectar production is not induced in response to fruit damage and even decreases when the fruiting structure is subjected to herbivory. This shows that both an inducible and a constitutive variant of an indirect defense can occur within one plant species. This pattern of nectar allocation fits the optimal defense theory, which predicts high levels of constitutive defenses in valuable tissues such as fruits and induced defenses in less valuable tissues such as leaves. This result lends support to the interpretation that indirect defense has been a selective force in the evolution of bracteal nectaries. Although optimal defense theory has described direct defense allocation solely in terms of probability of attack and value of the plant structure, we argue that herbivore accessibility is an additional factor shaping the allocation of indirect defenses.

AB Apprehension is a behavioral response of a forager to risk of predation involving the allocation of the forager's attention away from foraging-related tasks and toward predator detection. It, along with time allocation, can be used by a forager to manage risk. Apprehension should increase, and time allocation should decrease with a forager's energetic state (marginal value of energy). We tested these predictions on Allenby's gerbils (Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi) by manipulating the energetic state of the gerbils through augmentations of millet seeds. We also manipulated two risk factors, the microhabitat of the foraging patch (bush or open) and the presence of barn owls (Tyto alba). We measured apprehension of gerbils using the selectivity of gerbils for trays that differed in the distribution of seeds that they contained and time allocation using the amount of seeds left behind in trays, the giving-up density (GUD). Gerbils harvested 4.6 times more seeds when supplemental seeds were available, 17.4% fewer seeds when owls were present, 25.8% fewer seeds from the open than the bush microhabitat, and 19.3% fewer seeds from trays when seed augmentations were also present. With regard to time allocation, gerbils had higher GUDs (allocated less time) when risk was higher: in the open microhabitat and in the presence of owls. Also, the response of gerbils to owls was affected both by the seed augmentation and by microhabitat. With regard to apprehension, the gerbils were more apprehensive when extra seeds were added. Their level of apprehension changed little in the bush microhabitat but increased greatly in the open microhabitat when energetic state was manipulated. Thus, gerbils use both time allocation and apprehension in response to predators. Changes in the energetic state of a forager led to the predicted increase in apprehension accordance with Clark's asset protection principle.

AB Inbreeding, which is common in plants, may increase the vulnerability of. populations to natural enemies. Similarly, natural enemies may increase the expression of inbreeding depression in their hosts, resulting in altered selection on host mating-system evolution. To examine effects of inbreeding on tolerance to herbivory, we transplanted experimentally self- and cross-fertilized plants into four field populations of Mimulus guttatus and applied single Philaenus spumarius (spittlebug) nymphs to half. At the end of the growing season, we scored plants for five fitness components (reproductive effort, biomass, survival, probability of producing flowers or buds, and probability of bolting). Inbreeding reduced population-level tolerance to spittlebug herbivory with respect to plant aboveground biomass. Inbreeding effects on tolerance varied significantly among plant families for three fitness traits, indicating the opportunity for selection by herbivores to improve tolerance in in breeding populations. These results also indicate that herbivores can alter inbreeding depression in plants. Our results mirror earlier greenhouse studies of inbreeding effects on plant-herbivore interactions, and demonstrate that these effects can be manifested in natural settings as well. This study indicates that inbreeding in natural populations can affect fitness not only directly, but also indirectly through altered interactions with natural enemies.

AB This study explored how a flying frugivorous mammal, the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), meets the increased energy requirements of reproduction. This bat feeds on low-protein fruit, and females have bimodal polyestrous cycles that are relatively long for a small mammal. We measured the energy and water balance of captive nonreproductive, pregnant, and lactating females, and of free-ranging lactating females. Our results indicate that females use more than one strategy to cope with the high energy demands of reproduction. These strategies may change according to the availability of food and reproductive status. The primary strategy near the end of pregnancy and at peak lactation was increased food consumption. In the laboratory, mean metabolizable energy intake (MEI) of pregnant and lactating females (271 and 360 kJ/d, respectively) increased by 35% and 80%, respectively, compared to that of nonreproductive females (200 kJ/d). At peak lactation, energy intake measured by doubly labeled water averaged 350 kJ/d. During late pregnancy, water turnover rate (WTO) increased by 15-23% compared to that of nonreproductive females. In the field, WTO at peak lactation, was 44% higher than in captive lactating females, and milk production was estimated to be 22 mL/d. Absolute resting metabolic rate (RMR) in late pregnancy was significantly lower than the RMR of nonreproductive females, suggesting that a metabolic depression was used as a compensatory mechanism. Fat deposition was evident during the second pregnancy, when food availability was high, presumably in preparation for a second lactation period. Fetal tissue represented similar to1.3% of the total energy assimilated during pregnancy, and the gross efficiency of lactation averaged 24%. Both values are lower than the values reported for other eutherian mammals, but similar to estimates for other bat species, and probably reflect the high energy costs associated with flight. A long lactation period may be constrained by flight and the low-protein diet of fruits. We conclude that the energy costs of Egyptian fruit bats during reproduction are distributed over a relatively long time, similar to those observed in large mammals.

AB Resonance is an interaction between extrinsic environmental variability and intrinsic population processes that can raise population mean density or amplify environmental fluctuations in systems with periodic environmental fluctuations. This study empirically demonstrates significant effects on population dynamics from resonance and describes the conditions under which they occur. In a laboratory microcosm experiment with the ciliate protist Colpidium striatum, resources were periodically alternated between high and low concentrations at different frequencies., Resonance raised the mean population density of rapidly fluctuating treatments by 21% compared to a constant control run at the average nutrient concentration, and eventually approximated the mean density of the highest nutrient control. The resonant resource perturbations occurred on a time scale intermediate to the reproduction and starvation rates of the organisms. It is likely that metabolic nonlinearities in those reproductive and starvation responses interacted with the periodic resources fluctuations of intermediate frequency to produce the population boost through the cumulative Storage of resources in the cells of the protists. The populations also showed a frequency threshold effect in the translation of environmental variability into population variability. The patterns of population abundance and variability observed in this experiment indicate that resonance between intrinsic and extrinsic processes may be an important factor to consider in population dynamics.

AB Predators and parasitoids of herbivores can play important roles in plant defense. Plant traits that attract the enemies of herbivores are presumed to have co-evolved with these enemies in obligate relationships such as ant-Acacia mutualisms, In facultative interactions, selection via herbivores' enemies also may shape plant traits, although no study has yet demonstrated all of the necessary criteria to document selection in a single tri-trophic system. Using manipulative experiments during a two-year study, I showed that predatory ants can act as agents of selection on extrafloral nectary (EFN) traits. Wild cotton (Gossypium thurberi) EFNs attract a number of generalist ant species that consume and disturb herbivores. Sire-offspring regression analyses demonstrated that both the proportion of leaves with EFNs and EFN size exhibit heritable variation in G. thurberi. A two-year insecticide experiment revealed that herbivory reduced plant growth and seed production in the field, independently of the effects of ants. Both ant abundance and EFN availability were manipulated in the field using a 2 X 2 factorial design. When ant visitation was reduced, plants supported more herbivores, experienced greater leaf damage, and produced fewer flowers and seeds. Furthermore, fewer ants visited plants with experimentally reduced EFNs; leaf damage was higher and seed number was lower compared to plants with ambient levels of. EFN, indicating that EFNs mediate the benefits of ants. In addition, natural variation in EFN frequency correlated positively with seed production. This study provides the strongest support yet that casual ant associates can influence the evolution of extrafloral nectary traits and suggests that plant evolution in facultative mutualisms depends on community-level dynamics.

AB An ongoing roof experiment, where N and acid inputs were reduced to the recommended critical load levels, has been conducted since 199 1 in an N-saturated spruce stand in Solling, Germany. Our study was aimed at (1) quantifying the changes in gross rates of microbial N cycling under ambient and reduced N conditions, and (2) relating the soil N dynamics to the changes in N leaching and N status of trees. Two roofs were used, one to achieve "ambient" and the other reduced ("clean rain") inputs, with a roofless plot as a control for possible roof effects. In 2001, the ambient roof and ambient no-roof plots showed an apparent decrease in gross N mineralization rates and significantly lower microbial NH4+ immobilization rates and turnover rates of NH4+ and microbial N pools. The microbial NO3- immobilization rates and NO3- pool turnover rates were lower than the microbial NH4+ immobilization rates and NH4+ pool turnover rates, showing that less NO,cycled through microorganisms than NH4+. There was also low abiotic NO3- immobilization. High NO3- input from throughfall and low microbial turnover rates of the NO3- Pool, combined with low abiotic NO3- retention, may have contributed to the high NO3- leaching losses in these ambient plots.
   The clean rain plot showed a slight increase in gross N mineralization rates and significantly higher microbial NH4+ immobilization rates and turnover rates of NH4+ and microbial N pools. Neither nitrification nor soil NO3- was detectable. There was an increase in abiotic NO3- immobilization. Foliar N concentration had decreased but was still adequate. An efficient cycling of NH4+ through microorganisms, combined with the high abiotic NO3- immobilization, indicated efficient mineral N retention in the clean rain plot. These results indicated that long-term reduction of throughfall N and acid inputs had induced high but tightly coupled microbial NH4+ cycling and an increase in abiotic NO3- retention, which contributed to the reversal of N saturation.

AB To investigate bet hedging and species coexistence in a guild of Sonoran Desert winter annuals, we subjected seeds of eight species to factorial combinations of summer treatments (varying temperature and precipitation), germination conditions (representative of early, middle, and late germination season temperatures and day lengths), and experiment trial dates (spanning the germination season). In keeping with bet hedging theory, we found that many viable seeds would not germinate in response to any combination of treatments (germination usually <50%). In keeping with the storage effect model, we found that these coexisting species differed in their germination response to our experimental manipulations and also differed in how the experimental variables interact. Field germination data from a long-term project on population and community dynamics of this guild show that germination fractions are similar between field and growth chamber and that species that tend to germinate under early season conditions in the growth chamber also tend to do so under unmanipulated field conditions. Some species are nondormant during the summer and only acquire dormancy at the onset of the autumn germination season, while others appear to have either innate or conditional dormancy until the onset of the germination season.

AB Although it has long been recognized that marsh plant community composition shifts across estuarine salinity gradients, the mechanisms responsible for this species zonation have never been experimentally examined. In southern New England marshes of the United States, we investigated the relative importance of physical and biotic factors in generating estuarine species distribution patterns. Greenhouse studies revealed that all of the common plants it! this system grow better in fresh water than in full-strength salt water. To test the hypothesis that the spatial segregation of these plants is driven by differential tolerance to salt stress and plant competition, we performed transplant experiments with 10 common plants in the system. When freshwater marsh plants were transplanted to salt marshes, they did poorly and generally died with or without neighbors present. In contrast, when saltmarsh plants were transplanted to freshwater marshes, they thrived in the absence of neighbors, growing better than they did in salt marshes, but when neighbors were present, they were strongly suppressed. These results suggest that the spatial segregation of plants across estuarine salinity gradients is driven by competitively superior freshwater marsh plants displacing salt-tolerant plants to physically harsh saltmarsh habitats, whereas freshwater marsh plants are limited from living in salt marshes by physical factors (e.g., high salinities). These results contribute to our understanding of the organization and assembly of tidal marsh plant communities and have important implications for understanding how marsh plant communities will respond to human modification of estuarine hydrology and climate change.

AB Riparian cottonwood (Populus deltoides) forests form the one of the most extensive deciduous forest ecosystems in arid regions of the western United States. However, cottonwood populations are threatened by flow alteration and channel degradation caused by dams, water diversions, and groundwater pumping. We developed a stochastic, density-dependent, population model to (1) consolidate information concerning cottonwood population dynamics in a conceptual and analytical framework, (2) determine whether complex forest stand dynamics can be predicted from basic cottonwood vital rates and river hydrology, and (3) aid in planning prescribed floods by projecting how altered flow regimes might affect populations. The model describes how annual variation in the hydrograph affects cottonwood mortality (via floods and droughts) and recruitment (via scouring of new habitat and seedling establishment). Using parameter values for the undammed Yampa River in Colorado, we found that abundances of seedlings and Younger trees followed a boom-bust cycle driven by high flood mortalities while reproductive adult abundance followed a less erratic 5-15-yr periodicity driven by multiyear sequences of flows favorable to stand recruitment. Conversely, chance occurrences of multiple drought years eliminated cottonwood from up to 50% of available habitat, providing opportunities for competing plant species to establish. By simulating flow alterations on the Yampa ranging from channelization (many floods/droughts) to damming (few floods/droughts), the model suggested that mature cottonwood forest should be most abundant near the observed natural flow regime. Model analysis also Suggested that flow regimes with high flood frequencies result in stable (albeit small) population sizes, while stable flows result in highly variable population sizes prone to local extinction.

AB The direct and indirect effects of seed predation by a Neotropical community of small rodents and large mammals were examined in a 1.5-year exclosure experiment in Corcovado National Park, Costa Rica. This park has an intact terrestrial mammalian community, including small rodents and large mammalian seed predators, an essential condition to quantify the dynamics of seed predation. To measure seed predation, three exclosure treatments (1.2 m radius x 1.5 m tall) in two forest types (primary vs. secondary forest) were monitored: (1) fenced exclosures that excluded large mammals, (2) fenced exclosures that excluded both large and small mammals, and (3) open controls. Tethered seeds were added from nine common species of canopy trees and lianas (seven families), and seed removal was measured from February 2001 to July 2002. Small rodents had significant negative effects on four of the nine seed species tested, and the effects of small rodents on seed, predation differed significantly from the effects of large mammals and insect/fungal pathogens. Small-rodent seed predation (both rates and total proportion destroyed) did not differ between secondary and primary forest habitats. Throughout the exclosure study, small-rodent populations were marked and recaptured to document their community composition and densities. Small-rodent population fluctuations were observed, and shifts in composition directly affected species-specific and community-wide seed predation. Fewer seeds were destroyed when small-rodent abundance was low. Small-rodent population fluctuations also had an indirect effect, reversing the relative importance of small rodents and large mammals and resulting in large mammals becoming the primary seed predators. This change did not only decrease total seed predation for some species; it had the additional effect of moving from a primarily negative interaction (seed predation from the small rodents) to the varied interactions of seed predation and seed dispersal (scatter-hoarding). This research illustrated that small-rodent community fluctuations are a mechanism responsible for variability in the process of Neotropical seedling regeneration.

AB Size-structured population models often exhibit single generation cycles, which are driven by scramble competition within a generation and size-based competitive asymmetry among generations. These cycles are characterized by the dominance of a single cohort and thus by a high degree of synchronization of the individual life histories. The models, however, do not generally allow for divergence in size,among individuals born at the same time. Size divergence may, for example, result from the stochasticity that arises due to local interactions between individuals and their environment and has been shown to affect the population dynamics within generations. We studied the effect of the size divergence that develops as a result of stochasticity over many generations, considering the full population dynamical feedback, including resource dynamics. The stochastic variation in our model was generated by local interactions of individuals with the environment. We varied the mobility of individuals, which regulated the strength of the local resource feedback on the consumers. We found that at very high mobility our model provided a good correspondence to similar but fully deterministic models, showing the single generation cycles typical for a size-structured cons It mer-resource interaction. Intermediate levels of mobility had no notable effect on the dynamics of our model population. At very low mobility, the dynamics appeared to be strongly influenced by stochasticity. We showed that by superposition of the underlying deterministic dynamics and the stochasticity induced by local interactions we could fully understand the dynamics of the model. This finding led us to conclude that, while individual variability may have an impact on population structure and dynamics, it does not necessarily change the deterministic interactions that determine global population dynamics. More specifically, our study highlights the robustness of single generation cycles, showing that even at high levels of individual variability the population dynamics will intermittently exhibit patterns resembling these cycles.

AB Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are symbiotic microorganisms that can significantly improve the water and nutrient uptake of host plants. With reference to ECM fungi, we studied the effects of established shrubs on the subsequent seedling establishment of three woody plant species in a volcanic desert on Mt. Fuji, Japan, during early primary succession. Salix reinii, an alpine dwarf willow, is the pioneer ECM plant at this research site, and many ECM fungi have colonized established willow shrubs. ECM formation was found to be high on S. reinii seedlings that had been transplanted near established willow shrubs. The growth and nitrogen content of the seedlings increased significantly with the numbers of associated ECM fungal species and ECM root tips. ECM formation on transplanted seedlings of Betula ermanii and Larix kaempferi, two subsequent successional tree species, was also higher near the established willow shrubs. Molecular identification showed that almost all of the ECM fungi on transplanted seedlings of the three plant species were of the same species as those observed on the established willow shrubs. These results indicate that ECM fungi associated with established willow shrubs are essential in facilitating seedling establishment of successional plant species in the early successional volcanic desert.

AB Several recent studies suggest that community composition can take on alternate, apparently stable, states. For the most part, these studies are observational in nature and have not shown that alternate states arise from the order of species arrival during community assembly. Previous studies also provide little insight into the mechanisms that create alternate states, especially when direct species interactions, rather than environmental feedback, control their formation. We conducted experiments in identical physical environments to show that differences in the sequence of community assembly can create alternate species compositions that persist for many generations. Assembly sequence determined whether experimental food webs contained a single intraguild predator, or two intraguild predators. When the intraguild predator, Blepharisma americanum, became established in communities before the introduction of Tetraltymena vorax, combined effects of resource depletion and intraguild predation prevented the establishment of Tetrahymena. In contrast, when Tetrahymena preceded Blepharisma, both species frequently coexisted. Supporting experiments describe the exploitative competitive abilities of both intraguild predators, document the population dynamics of each species in less complex community modules, and determine the ability of Tetrahymena to invade Blepharisma cultures in the absence of competing prey. These results show that both competition and predation contribute to the formation of two alternate community states and confirm that one stable state resists transformation to the other.

AB From 1994 to 1997, 1 monitored 'Elepaio (Chasiempis sandwichensis), a forest bird endemic to Hawaii, in three sites that differed in either degree of habitat disturbance or population density. The goal was to determine whether areas with disturbed forest and reduced population density due to disease were lower-quality habitats that acted as population sinks. Sites where the forest had been disturbed by cattle grazing and timber harvesting contained larger 'Elepaio territories, supported less dense 'Elepaio populations, and had a higher proportion of subadult birds in the breeding population and, thus, can be considered lower-quality habitat for 'Elepaio. However, 'Elepaio populations in disturbed sites did not have lower survival, reproduction, or site fidelity than a population in denser forest, and they were self-sustaining. Disturbed sites were not population sinks maintained by immigration; they simply had a lower carrying capacity. Annual survival of territory-holders was high and was slightly higher in males (0.86 +/- 0.04 [mean +/- (SE)]) than in females (0.79 +/- 0.05). Fecundity was low, with pairs producing 0.56 +/- 0.06 fledglings per year, Site fidelity was high in males (0.98) and females (0.93), and most birds remained on the same territory for the duration of the study or until their presumed death. Population growth was stable at two sites ( lambda 0.96 +/- 0.03, 1.02 +/- 0.04) and increasing (1.12 +/- 0.04) at a site recovering from an epizootic of avian poxvirus. Young, subadult-plumaged males defended smaller territories and produced fewer fledglings than older males, but female age did not affect territory size or reproductive success. Recruitment age was younger where population density was lower.

AB This study investigated the degree to which the behavior of a predator in the marine environment can be used to indicate the availability of prey. It examined this in Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) feeding on krill, with a view to understanding how behavioral choices could lead to a nonlinear functional response. The study showed how fur seals adjusted their time budgets to maximize the mean rate of energy intake in response to varying prey abundance. The behavioral indicator of prey abundance was the amount of time spent by fur seals at the bottom of dives after adjustment for dive depth. This indicator was well correlated with independent measures of prey abundance. The indicator was calibrated in terms of net rate of energy intake from information about energy expenditures in Antarctic fur seals and was used within the framework of optimal foraging theory to examine how female fur seals organized their foraging activity within and between bouts. Foraging in Antarctic fur seals conformed to many of the predictions from energy rate-maximizing behavior. For example, the apparent net rate of energy intake by fur seals declined with time spent in a patch, and the rate of energy intake on leaving a patch declined as apparent food availability in the environment declined. In addition, the time spent in patches increased as apparent food availability declined. Antarctic fur seals were able to adjust their behavior to track highly variable prey distributions and densities. The simple decision about when to leave a patch in relation to current environmental prey availability appears to be responsible for allowing fur seals to maintain saturation of the foraging rate as food density declines.

AB The relative importance of regional and local processes in determining community structure is a long-standing problem in community ecology. This is especially problematic in communities from highly connected habitats, which undergo two opposing forces: differences in environmental conditions of the habitats lead to divergence of the communities, while the dispersal of individuals leads to convergence of the communities. Using a transplant experiment, we experimentally showed that biotic interactions, have a predictable, deterministic impact on zooplankton community structure in a metacommunity of highly interconnected shallow ponds. Fish predation and presence of abundant macrophyte cover. rapidly structured regional communities of zooplankton, both in terms of relative abundances and of cladoceran species richness. Moreover, we could use the relations between the experimentally manipulated environmental conditions and the observed experimental communities to successfully classify the contrasting local communities found in the original neighboring ponds, thus directly relating the experimental results to the actual field situation. Notwithstanding the observed strong impact of local biotic conditions, we also showed that dispersal had an influence on community structure and species richness. Dispersal increased species richness of cladocerans by three species and influenced zooplankton community structure. More-over, dispersal actually made the response to local conditions more deterministic.

AB Hormones. modulate complex suites of ecologically relevant behaviors through interactive cascades of signal transduction; evolutionary changes in the function of a single hormone can result in multiple changes in plant traits. Sites of hormone action and tissue sensitivity change throughout plant ontogeny, as embryos, seedlings, and reproductively mature plants cope With shifting suites of environmental variables and resource availability. Phenotypic plasticity and correlations and trade-offs between life history traits (such as resource use efficiency and allocation to growth and differentiation of meristems) also change as plants age; hormonal changes are central to these shifts. I synthesize evidence from the molecular and physiology literature and present novel data,on mangrove propagules, seedlings, saplings, and trees. Together, these data demonstrate that several ecologically important traits are hormonally mediated (both in the short term and over evolutionary time) in the diversification of plant lineages. I focus on two hormones with contrasting action: (1) abscisic acid (ABA), which regulates internal plant osmotic stability, membrane integrity, seed dormancy, and stomatal conductance; and (2) cytokinins (zeatin and allied adenine derivatives), which promote cell division, stimulate growth, delay leaf senescence, enhance the capacity of tissues to act as N sinks, and help to transduce signals of light and nutrient availability. ABA and cytokinin levels are correlated with patterns of osmotic tolerance, photosynthesis, growth; and leaf longevity, and. their concentrations in specific tissues change throughout plant development. Ecologists and evolutionary biologists are in a strong position now to creatively comprehend, predict, and potentially engineer plant strategies and adaptive trade-offs over plant lifetimes in light of emerging knowledge of hormones.

AB Understanding the factors affecting parasite aggregation in natural host populations is one of the central questions in parasite ecology. While different biological mechanisms giving rise to aggregation have been documented in the literature, the role of established parasites in vector attraction, and its importance in determining clumped parasite distributions has received-less attention. In a two-year field study, we evaluated the importance of a bird vector, Mimus thenca (Mimidae), on the aggregation dynamics of the holoparasitic mistletoe, Tristerix aphyllus, on its cactus host, Echinopsis chilensis. Removal of T. aphyllus from cacti decreased the number of visits and the time spent by the bird vector, which resulted in a 3.5-fold lower seed deposition of the mistletoe on experimental hosts than on control hosts. Vector preference, however, was not the only factor affecting aggregation in this system. Spine length of the cactus acted as a first line of defense against parasitism, by discouraging bird perching on top of host columns. While heavily parasitized hosts received more seeds than unparasitized hosts, spines counteracted this effect. These results provide field evidence that parasite aggregation results from the balance between vector behavior and host resistance traits.

AB The Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability (EICA) hypothesis predicts that introduced plants should lose enemy resistance and in turn evolve increased size or fecundity. We tested the first prediction of this hypothesis by growing introduced North American and native European genotypes of St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) in common gardens in the state of Washington, USA, and in Girona, Spain. In both gardens we measured levels of hypericin and pseudohypericin (and in Washington, hypericide)-compounds known to be toxic to generalist pathogens and herbivores. In a third common garden, in Spain, we experimentally manipulated native pathogen pressure (by treating plants with fungicides) and quantified how pathogen resistance varied between North American and European genotypes. North American St. John's Wort had lower levels of hypericin than European conspecifies in common gardens in Washington and Spain. North American plants also produced less hypericide (in Washington) and pseudohypericin (in Spain) than did European plants. In Spain. individuals were attacked by three generalist pathogens: Collelotrichum Sp. (Coelomycetes). Alternaria sp. (Hyphomycetes), and Fusarium oxysporum (Hyphomycetes). A higher percentage of individuals from North American Populations were infected by pathogens and died from pathogen attack compared to European genotypes. Infection also appeared to reduce plant size and fecundity; these negative effects were similar in Magnitude for North American and European genotypes. Taken together, results indicate that introduced St. John's Wort has lost enemy resistance. However, contrary to EICA, Current and previous results indicate that these chances have not been associated with an increase in plant size or fecundity.

AB The fundamental niche can be viewed as the set of conditions and resources that allow a given organism to survive and reproduce in the absence of biotic interactions. Quantitative descriptions of the environmental variables with which organisms are associated are becoming common with the advent of geographic information systems (GIS). Although such descriptive approaches to the niche are useful for interpolating species distributions, they implicitly incorporate biotic interactions and therefore do not represent the fundamental niche. A mechanistic understanding of the fundamental niche, when combined with GIS data, can provide us with greater insight into the causes of distribution and abundance, a solid foundation for exploring the role of biotic interactions, and greater confidence in extrapolating to novel circumstances such as climate change and species introductions. We apply such a mechanistic approach to Study the climatic component of the fundamental niche of a nocturnal lizard, Heteronotia binoei, across an entire continent. We combine physiological measurements of this species (thermal requirements for egg development, thermal preferences and tolerances, metabolic and evaporative water loss rates), and high-resolution climatic data for the Australian continent (ail, temperature, cloud cover, wind speed, humidity, and radiation), with biophysical models to calculate the climatic component of the fundamental niche of this lizard and map it onto the Australian landscape at high resolution. We also use this approach to predict the effects of a mild global warming on the degree-days in the soil for egg development and the potential for aboveground activity of the study organism.

AB Estimates of reproductive success and the factors that affect it can be inferred from observations of behavior or data on life history traits (e.g., dominance hierarchies, clutch size). Genetic parentage analysis, however, can precisely determine the number of offspring attributable to individual parents. We coupled multilocus microsatellite genotype-based parentage assignment exclusion testing with morphological and behavioral data to test hypotheses concerning the effects of specific traits on fitness of naturally spawning steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). With eight microsatellite loci (mean heterozygosity = 89%), we examined two parental generations (n(1) = 198, n(2) = 226) and their offspring as smolts (age 2: n(1) = 365, n(2) = 285) and as adults (n(1) = 81, n(2) = 77) to determine the effects of size, reproductive timing, and origin (hatchery or wild) on reproductive success. The mating system was complex; monogamy, polygamy, polyandry, polygyny, and polygynandry were all observed. Males had a greater variance in reproductive success than females, wild steelhead produced more offspring than hatchery steelhead, and the timing of reproduction had a significant role in production of smolt and adult offspring, especially for females. There was no indication that body size contributed to offspring production, in stark contrast to the literature and theory on the subject. A more complete knowledge of traits associated with fitness in salmonids is important for understanding salmonid ecology and evolution and crucial for the design of appropriate conservation programs.

AB Grouping organisms may suffer reduced growth due to food deprivation in the presence of larger conspecifics, but this cost can be outweighed by advantages of reduced predation risk in larger groups. Here, tagged new juveniles of a small, grouping damselfish Dascyllus aruanus, were added to small coral heads that were either empty or supported small groups of larger conspecifics. Half of the coral heads with conspecifics and half of those without were subjected daily to additions of brine shrimp, similar to natural zoo-plankton food, over a three-week period.
   Growth was measured as increase in body length, change in body condition (lipid content), and overall energy gain. Body lipid reserves were higher (21%) in recruits subjected to added food and in the presence of conspecifics (13%). Total energy was higher (53%) in recruits with added food but was not affected by conspecific presence. There was an interaction between conspecific presence and food supplementation treatment on change in body length, a commonly used growth estimator. These differences suggest that the benefits of extra food and effects of conspecific presence differ depending on the metric used to measure growth, but that presence of larger conspecifics enhanced the increased growth that resulted from higher food intake.

AB Inspired by the importance of globally well-constrained carbon: nitrogen: phosphorus (C:N:P) ratios in planktonic biomass to the understanding of nutrient cycles and biotic feedbacks in marine ecosystems, we looked for analogous patterns in forest ecosystems worldwide. We used data from the literature to examine the stoichiometry of C, N, and P in forest foliage and litter on both global and biome levels. Additionally, we examined the scaling of nutrient investments with biomass and production both globally and within biomes to determine if and when these ratios respond to macroscale ecosystem properties (such as nutrient availability). We found that, while global forest C:N:P ratios in both foliage and litter were more variable than those of marine particulate matter, biome level (temperate broadleaf, temperate coniferous, and tropical) ratios were as constrained as marine ratios and statistically distinct from one another. While we were more interested in the relative constancy of the C:N:P ratios than their numerical value we did note, as have others, that the atomic ratios calculated for foliage (1212:28:1) and litter (3007:45:1) reflect the increased proportion of C-rich structural material characteristic of terrestrial vegetation. Carbon : nutrient ratios in litter were consistently higher than in comparable foliar data sets, suggesting that resorption of nutrients is a globally important mechanism, particularly for R Litter C:N ratios were globally constant despite biome-level differences in foliar C:N; we speculate that this strong coupling may be caused by the significant contribution of immobile cell wall bound proteins to the total foliar N pool. Most ratios scaled isometrically across the range of biomass stocks and production in all biomes suggesting that ratios arise directly from physiological constraints and are insensitive to factors leading to shifts in biomass and production. There were, however, important exceptions to this pattern: nutrient investment in broadleaf forest litter and coniferous forest foliage increased disproportionately relative to C with increasing biomass and production suggesting a systematic influence of macroscopic factors on ratios.

AB During the past 50 years, biogeochemistry has emerged as the premier scientific discipline to examine human impacts on the global environment. Important advances have derived from the synthesis of biogeochemical cycles at the global level, from the recognition that biochemical stoichiometry constrains the composition of living tissue, and from large-scale experiments that address the response of whole ecosystems to human impact. Future work will further pursue these avenues, with frequent use of modern, molecular methods to ascertain the role of individual species and species diversity in ecosystem function. Biogeochemists will increasingly Deed to translate the important results of their work to help formulate effective environmental policy.

AB In traditional source-sink models, vital rates and movement probabilities are assumed to be temporally homogeneous. Numerous studies, however, have demonstrated that temporal heterogeneity is the rule rather than the exception in natural systems. A case of particular interest is an expanding and contracting population where determination. of source and sink populations is dependent on the timing and duration at which population growth rates are measured. Thus, ecologists have been perplexed about what is the proper scale to test for source-sink dynamics. In this study, I present a temporally variable source-sink dynamic driven by flooding disturbance. I measured population growth rates of an herbivorous neotropical rolled-leaf beetle, Cephaloleia fenestrata (Chrysomelidae), at different temporal scales in this expanding and contracting population. I demonstrate that flooding created a strong sink, but the system lacked source-sink dynamics during nonflood periods. The sink is caused by a flood-related sevenfold decrease in survival probability. There was no evidence for effects of flooding on recruitment. Migration was directional from the upland to the flood zone habitat, supporting the conclusion that the population in the flood zone is a sink. A Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that whether the population in the flood zone is a sink, and the intensity of the sink, ultimately depend on the flooding frequency. Given an observed flood frequency of approximately once per year, the flood zone population was determined to be a Ion g-term sink. This study provides evidence of high temporal variability resulting in fluctuations in and out of a source-sink dynamic and implicates a causal factor (increased mortality due to flooding). These results illustrate the importance of. considering temporal variability in source-sink dynamics, and in choosing the proper temporal scale at which to test for source-sink dynamics.

AB Transformation of landscapes is considered to be one of the main drivers behind species loss, regionally and globally. Theory and empirical studies suggest that landscape structure influences species diversity in many habitats. These effects may be manifested at different spatial scales depending on species response to landscape heterogeneity. A similar, but often neglected, scaling issue concerns the temporal scale of species response to landscape change. In this study, we found time lags of 50-100 years in the response of plant species diversity to changing configuration of habitats in the landscape. When analyzing remnants of traditionally managed seminatural grasslands in Sweden, we found that species diversity was not related to present-day connectivity of the investigated sites, irrespective of spatial scale (3.1-12.5 km(2)). However, when using maps depicting landscapes 50 and 100 years ago, respectively, strong positive effects of habitat connectivity appeared, at increasing spatial scale for the older landscapes. Thus, analyses of how species diversity relates to present-day landscapes may be misleading, and future species loss may be expected even if the present landscape is maintained.

AB The discovery record of introduced species reflects a combination of the introduction process and the discovery process. For this reason, the discovery record does not provide a direct proxy for the record of introductions. We describe a general method for estimating the rate of introductions from the discovery record. The method is based on a statistical model of the discovery record that includes both the introduction and discovery processes. The method is illustrated using the discovery record of introduced species in the San Francisco estuary (California, USA). The estimated mean rate of introductions increases from 0.3 introductions in, 1850 to 2.3 introductions in 1995.

AB Convergence between species niches and biological traits was investigated for 88 Leucadendron taxa in the Cape Floristic region. First, niche separation analysis was performed to relate species' niche positions/breadths with bioclimatic gradients. These gradients of aridity, seasonality of water availability, heat, and cold stress explained almost all variation in niche distributions. Species present in zones of extreme aridity or temperature exhibited narrower niche breadths than species situated in moderate sites, suggesting that stress-tolerant species do not occupy broad environmental ranges. Second, species niche positions were related to selected biological traits. Species of and sites had significantly lower blade areas than did species of moist sites, confirming a functional trade-off between stress tolerance and productivity for leaf design. Species dispersal mode was correlated to species niche positions on the aridity gradient, suggesting allometrically determined correlations between leaf design and the design of reproductive structures. Species niche positions were also correlated with flowering traits, with species that initiate flowering in winter found under Mediterranean climate influence and species that initiate flowering in spring in sites with greater summer rainfall input. By interrelating species niche positions on bioclimatic gradients with selected biological traits, we explored a novel biogeographical approach to understanding species distributions.

AB The use of fractal analysis to study animal movement paths has been criticized because the inherent assumptions of the technique are rarely discussed, and most movement paths violate the assumption of scale invariance. While this violation may prohibit the use of the technique for population-level prediction, it need not restrict the analysis of individual variation in movement patterns, an application of fractal theory that has received relatively little research attention. Therefore, we review fractal analysis and its assumptions, highlighting three ways in which it can yield useful information about individual movement paths regardless of whether or not the assumption of scale invariance has been met. We used these techniques to analyze patterns of individual variation and potential causes of variation in the dispersal searching paths of two species of Australian treecreeper (Passeriformes: Climacteridae). By comparing relative fractal D, or the relative tortuosity and thus thoroughness of search paths, we found that individuals faced a trade-off between thoroughness and the extent of searching. Thoroughness also differed between the sexes and the species, possibly as a direct consequence of mating and social systems. For almost all individuals, thoroughness varied depending on the spatial scale at which it was examined, revealing three distinct domains of scale in which movement tactics vary because movement is used for very different purposes. Variability in movement tactics was greatest in the largest spatial-scale domain, the one used exclusively for dispersal movements, suggesting that dispersal tactics show more intraspecific variation than other types of movement because dispersal decisions are influenced by a greater variety of factors. Our results reveal that fractal analysis can provide useful information on the causes of and constraints on individual movement strategies, creating empirically based models of animal movement and thus a firm foundation for modeling movement processes from individual to landscape scales.

AB Many analytical techniques that assess resource selection focus on individual relocation points as the sample unit and classify resources as either used or available. Commonly, the relative use of each resource is quantified as the number of observations in each resource class or the proportional occurrence of a resource within a home range. We believe that a more accurate estimate can be summarized by a utilization distribution (UD). We present an analytical approach that explicitly incorporates a probabilistic measure of use, as defined by the UD. We used animal relocation points and fixed-kernel techniques to determine a UD within a home range. We related this probabilistic measure of use to,categorical and continuous resource variables using multiple regression. Regression errors accounted for spatial autocorrelation so that the significance of regression coefficients could be appraised for each animal and averaged across animals. This allowed us to quantify the individualistic nature of resource selection and test for consistency in use of resources by a population. Sample sizes in population assessments correctly reflected the individual animal as the experimental unit. We used this technique in a geographic information system setting to examine the importance of local-scale (forest cover) and landscape-scale (degree of fragmentation, proximity to edges and human use areas) attributes to breeding season habitat selection by 25 radio-tagged Steller's Jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) in western Washington State, USA. Individual jays varied significantly in habitat use, but most (20) concentrated their use in areas with many vegetation patches or in areas with extensive edge between forest and nonforested land cover. This confirmed our prediction that jays prefer fragmented habitat and forest edges and helped to explain why jays are most abundant in fragmented landscapes. However, we refined our, understanding of why they used such habitats by demonstrating that landscape attributes. affected use of local habitat features:high-contrast edges were used most if they were associated with small human settlements and campgrounds. Use of patchy and edgy areas within home ranges may be reinforced by natural selection because jays that inhabited areas with complex-shaped patches and concentrated their activity in such areas were most likely to fledge young. Concentration of use along forest-human land use interfaces may explain the greater risk of nest predation to other birds in such settings.

AB It is widely accepted that the postfire recovery in Mediterranean plant communities is carried out by direct regeneration, i.e., the fast recovery of a plant community with the same species pool that it had immediately prior to disturbance. However, there is evidence that not all plant species in the Mediterranean basin survive fire in all situations, suggesting that the direct regeneration process might not apply to all situations. We analyze whether the main combinations of forest tree species (up to 16) of the western Mediterranean basin exhibit a postfire direct regeneration process. Based on data from field surveys, we have developed a stochastic model to predict the medium-term forest dynamics. In general, Quercus species (resprouters) and the pines Pinus halepensis and P. pinaster (seeders that produce abundant seedlings) showed direct regeneration patterns. In contrast, forests of P. nigra, P. sylvestris, and P. pinea (seeders that produce few seedlings) changed to other situations after fired This outcome was validated by additional data from plots with known fire history. These results did not support completely the direct regeneration model, since only half of the combinations of tree species analyzed exhibited a >50% probability of recovering the original prefire situation after fire. This partial failure of direct regeneration evidences the need for reconsidering restoration and conservation plans for Mediterranean ecosystems after fire.

AB There is now quite an extensive literature based on analysis of multivariate abundances, which have often been collected according to a MANOVA design. Many test statistics have been proposed specifically for this case, yet remarkably the power of these methods has not previously been compared. In this paper, the power of distance-based statistics (e.g., Mantel, analysis of similarities) is compared to variable-based statistics (e.g., redundancy analysis, the sum of ANOVA F statistics), when using permutation tests to assess significance of all statistics. Different choice of transformation, standardization, and distance measure were considered.
   For 19 data sets taken from the literature, P values for the different statistics were compared. Power simulations were then conducted, where data were generated to mimic the properties of each of the 19 data sets.
   For transformed data, using different distance measures (Euclidean, Manhattan, BrayCurtis) and different distance-based statistics had little effect on power. Overall, statistics based on multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were at least as powerful as others, although particular data sets gave different results. The distance-based statistics most commonly used in the literature do not standardize abundances, so these were more powerful when effects are present in taxa that are more variable (on the transformed scale), and less powerful otherwise.
   There are several reasons to prefer a statistic based on MANOVA to others (e.g., interpretability, generalization to more complex designs), and so we generally recommend that the MANOVA-based statistics used here be preferred to distance-based statistics.

AB Empirical studies show that the relationship between species diversity and productivity can be strongly scale dependent. At the local scale of population dynamics the relationship is commonly unimodal or humped, but it is frequently monotonically increasing at larger spatial scales. Such contrasting patterns can occur if beta diversity (compositional dissimilarity among sites) also increases with productivity, but mechanistic reasons for this remain unresolved. Here we use theoretical models to explore the influence of ecological assembly on the diversity of multitrophic communities along gradients of productivity. We show that assembly dynamics can generate scale-dependent. patterns consistent with those observed in nature; while unimodal productivity-diversity patterns are produced at the scale of local communities,, positive monotonic patterns emerge when diversity is measured at larger spatial scales (among communities). This occurs due to increases in beta diversity with productivity. Our results suggest that increases in beta diversity, and resultant scale dependency, can depend on three vital and interactive elements: the presence of more than one consumer trophic level, a greater propensity for cyclic compositional change at high productivities, and the stochastic nature of species dispersal and invasion history.

AB Surveys of natural habitats often indicate that native and exotic species richness are positively correlated Lit large scales and negatively correlated at small scales. The small-scale relationship is often presented as evidence that native richness can repel invasion or conversely that exotic invasions can reduce native diversity. The larger scale pattern has been interpreted as evidence of the importance of facilitation, variable habitat quality, propagule supply, and other ecological phenomena. However, these explanations fail to consider expected native-exotic richness relationships under a null model assuming no species interactions. We show via simulation that the null expectation for a randomly assembled community is a negative relationship between native and exotic species richness at the smallest scales and. when plots vary in total richness, a positive relationship at larger Scales. We outline a procedure to compare observational data to this null expectation using, a permutation test of labels of species origin (native or exotic). Our use of this technique on plant community data indicates that patterns of native and exotic richness are remarkably similar to those generated by a null model. We argue that a null model approach is needed to evaluate whether observed native-exotic richness data deviate significantly from expected patterns generated by sampling and statistical artifacts.

AB Hydrological disturbances, usually floods and drying, govern the distribution and abundance of biota and ecological processes in freshwater ecosystems. Reducing hydrological variability should reduce biodiversity and affect ecological processes. Many of Australia's rivers have reduced variability with river regulation, but some remain free flowing. We tested the variability hypothesis using waterbird communities on 12 floodplain lakes, paired into six systems distributed across half of the continent, over the period from 1983 to 2001. Half of the floodplain lakes were regulated (reservoirs) with stable water levels, while the remainder had unaltered hydrology. We analyzed in more detail the waterbird community within the Menindee system, using eight floodplain lakes, paired into four groups of flow regimes. Similar but less marked patterns occurred within the Menindee system. Overall, mean density (+/-1 SE) on unregulated floodplain lakes was significantly higher (6.04 +/- 1.64 waterbirds/ha), compared with regulated floodplain lakes (0.66 +/- 0.22 waterbirds/ha). The mean number of species on floodplain lakes was significantly higher on unregulated lakes ( 17.21 +/- 0.95, n = 19), compared with regulated floodplain lakes (9.32 +/- 0.56, n = 19). Numbers of waterbird species were significantly higher on unregulated lakes compared with regulated lakes, reaching a higher mean accumulation value over time. High diversity was observed in three of the five functional feeding groups that feed on invertebrate populations and aquatic vegetation. The other two feeding groups (piscivores and large wading species) were similar in number and density between regulated and unregulated lakes, possibly because exotic fish species thrived in regulated lakes. Ordination analyses supported these observations, clearly separating unregulated lakes and flow-regulated lakes. Reduction of hydrological variability, particularly removal of natural drying periods, affected the ecology of regulated floodplain lakes. High waterbird biodiversity requires natural flooding and drying disturbance on lowland rivers, where extensive floods are punctuated by drying periods.

AB Species diversity at the local-community scale can be altered by numerous factors, including disturbances, predators, and resource levels. Intermediate levels of these three factors are predicted to enhance coexistence and diversity. However, no study has examined how these factors may interact to alter community composition. The protozoan and rotifer community that colonized containers set in a forest was used to examine the interactions between these local community processes. We conducted a fully factorial microcosm experiment that manipulated disturbance frequency, predator density, and resource levels to examine protozoan and rotifer richness, community composition, and species abundance. Species richness was significantly altered by disturbances and predators, while predator densities interacted with disturbances and resources. Total abundance was significantly affected by each treatment, as well as a disturbance and predator interaction. We found that community composition was altered by each of the treatments and their interactions, indicating that different groups of species were present depending on the treatments. These results indicate that strong species sorting occurs in this community. Understanding these factors alone and in concert can provide insight to the potential complexities that underlie community structure and species composition.

AB Although floral and extrafloral nectar traits are important for plant reproduction and defense, we know little about their genetic basis. Only a handful of studies have quantified heritable variation for nectar traits, primarily in controlled environments that minimize environmental variation. Most such studies have reported strong genetic influences, with heritabilities often >0.35. However, because nectar traits are often very responsive to environmental variation, even substantial amounts of genetic variation may be swamped out in the,field. Environmental variation deserves to be studied in its own right, including exploration of genotype X environment interaction for nectar traits . Most genetic studies of nectar have focused on production rate and concentration, whereas we know almost nothing about the heritability of other important traits such as production patterns, sugar ratios, amino acid composition, taste, and scent. Likewise, almost nothing is known about the heritability of extrafloral nectar traits. Important progress on all of these fronts can be made using simple experimental designs to quantify environmental effects, genotype X environment interactions, clonal repeatability, and correlated traits. There is great promise in molecular approaches, but their use will not obviate the need for more quantitative genetic studies in the field and greenhouse.

AB Spiders are known to influence plant fitness, and vice versa. Yet, it has not been appreciated that these facultative relationships can be mutualistic. I examined the interaction between Phryganoporus candidus, a subsocial Australian spider, and the extrafloral nectary-bearing shrub Acacia ligulata to explore variability in mutualistic interactions over a three-year period. Spiders enhanced seed production by reducing seed predation by heteropterans, wasps, and weevils. Because spider colonies occupy only a fraction of a plant's volume, average benefits ranged from 0.4 to 6% increases in whole-plant seed production. These benefits were strongest in years of low seed production, suggesting that spiders may buffer plants against female reproductive failure. To evaluate benefits for spiders, I established experimental spider colonies on three common hosts. Spider performance (persistence and prey capture rates) on live A. ligulata and live hopbush Dodonaea viscosa exceeded that on dead acacia, suggesting that live hosts are more beneficial than dead hosts. Stable-isotope analyses demonstrated that colonies living on the three hosts differed substantially in diet, providing a possible mechanism for the observed differential suitability of hosts. However, the analyses were unable to establish conclusively that A. ligulata extrafloral nectar was an important reward for spiders. Variability in the A. ligulata P. candidus system suggests that plant-spider associations, like other facultative protection relationships, likely vary along a continuum from antagonism to mutualism.

AB Most plants respond to herbivore damage with elevated chemical and/or structural mechanisms of resistance. However, some plants, particularly those with few chemical defenses, may actually become more susceptible to herbivores following damage; that is, damage may induce susceptibility. We tested the hypothesis that a fungal symbiont of tall fescue grass provides induced resistance to aphids by manipulating fungal infection, plant damage (clipping), and level of nutrient fertilizer in greenhouse/laboratory experiments. The fungus had a negative effect on aphid reproduction that was most pronounced following damage. This result appears to be caused by elevated levels of alkaloids produced by the fungus after damage. Furthermore, plants lacking fungal infection were more susceptible to aphids following damage. Hence, while plant damage induces susceptibility in uninfected plants, it does the opposite (induced resistance) in infected plants. Additional experiments showed that the reversal of induced susceptibility is influenced by intrinsic (fungal strain) as well as extrinsic (nutrient application to plants) factors. We also found that the induced resistance conferred by the fungus comes at the cost of tolerance (reduced regrowth) in infected plants. As a modulator of both resistance and tolerance, the fungus plays a central role in influencing defense of host plants against herbivores and should have important implications for plant-herbivore interactions in natural and agricultural systems.

AB Randomization of,presence-absence data matrices with fixed row and column totals is an important tool in ecological research wherever the significance of data-based statistics (e.g., species association measures) is to be evaluated. In the current literature of numerical ecology, however, there has been no algorithm that randomizes moderately large matrices in short time such that equidistribution of results is guaranteed. We show that a simple modification of the swap algorithm, called here the "trial-swap method," satisfies the requirement for equidistribution. Since this is relatively slow, We suggest two fast algorithms that, combined with the trial-swap method, produce all possible results with equal chance. The three procedures are illustrated using actual examples taken from bird biogeography and vegetation ecology.

AB The time interval between successive migrations of biological species causes a delay time in the reaction-diffusion equations describing their space-time dynamics. This lowers the predicted speed of the waves of advance, as compared to classical models. It has been shown that this delay-time effect improves the modeling of human range expansions. Here, we demonstrate that it can also be important for other species. We present two new examples where the predictions of the time-delayed And the classical (Fisher) approaches are compared to experimental data. No free or adjustable parameters are used. We show that the importance of the delay effect depends on the dimensionless product of the initial growth rate and the delay time. We argue that the delay effect should be taken into account in the modeling of range expansions for biological species.

AB Compensation following herbivory is ail important element of plant defense; however. variation in compensation under naturally stressful conditions has yet to he evaluated directly. During Arizona's worst drought on record, we explored compensation following ungulate herbivory in a typically overcompensating population of scarlet gilia (ipomosis aggregata) near Flagstaff, Arizona, USA. In a natural Survey of browsed and unbrowsed plants. we documented severe undercompensation. We tested two factors that potentially contributed to this atypical pattern: (1) the direct effect of drought stress oil the capacity to compensate (following the typical single bout of herbivory) and (2) the indirect effect of drought stress on compensation through increased ungulate browsing. Using a 2 x 2 factorial experiment (with or without supplemental water, with or without clip-simulated herbivory typical of non-drought years), We found that water availability limited compensation (direct effect). In a second experiment examining the indirect effects of drought. we found that ungulates browsed scarlet gilia at unprecedented levels during the drought year, resulting ill severe undercompensation. We conclude that, although water was ail important limiting factor for compensation during the drought year, the overriding factor determining fitness achieved through compensation was the indirect effect of drought, i.e., drought-year-associated ungulate browsing.

AB In a 1999 Ecology article, T G. Gregoire and O. Schabenberger addressed the problem of obtaining truly symmetric confidence intervals for the total of a positively skewed biological population under simple random sampling. Their simulation study revealed that the skewness induced a substantial positive correlation between the estimator of the total and the estimator of its variance. This caused the standard nominally symmetric t-based intervals, based on approximate normality of the estimator of the total, to be highly unbalanced, i.e., intervals much more often missed from below than from above. To better cope with this situation I suggest an alternative confidence interval procedure that takes into account and adjusts for the induced correlation. A simulation study based on one of the populations used by Gregoire and Schabenberger shows that the resulting adjusted intervals have more balanced noncoverage probabilities and often higher coverage probability than the standard intervals in cases of substantial correlation. I also provide an example of an unequal probability design using auxiliary information, where there is much less need for an adjustment.

AB The intriguing impact of physical mixing processes on species interactions has always fascinated ecologists. Here, we exploit recent advances in plankton models to develop competition theory that predicts how changes in turbulent mixing affect competition for light between buoyant and sinking phytoplankton species. We compared the model predictions with a lake experiment, in which the turbulence structure of the entire lake was manipulated using artificial, mixing. Vertical eddy diffusivities were calculated from the measured temperature microstructure in the lake. Changes in turbulent mixing of the take caused a dramatic shift in phytoplankton species composition, consistent with the predictions of the competition model. The buoyant and potentially toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis dominated at low turbulent diffusivity, whereas sinking diatoms and green algae dominated at high turbulent diffusivity. These findings warn that changes in the turbulence structure of natural waters, for instance driven by climate change, may induce major shifts in the species composition of phytoplankton communities.

AB Because inbreeding, herbivory, and disease are common in plants and their separate impacts on fitness are well documented, investigators have begun to examine the consequences of inbreeding on plant-herbivore and plant-pathogen interactions. In this study, we examined the interrelationships among inbreeding, herbivory, and disease on reproductive output through both male (pollen production and pollen performance) and female (fruit and seed production and seed germination) functions. Inbred (selfed) and outbred plants from five families of a wild gourd (Cucurbita pepo ssp. texana) were grown in five 0.2-ha randomized blocks in an experimental garden. Half of the inbred and half of the outbred plants were sprayed weekly with a contact pesticide to control herbivores. The other half of the plants served as the controls (no-spray treatment). The spray treatment significantly reduced damage by cucumber beetles and aphid infestation levels, the two primary herbivores of the wild gourd. Moreover, because these herbivores are the sole vectors for the five most common viral diseases of cucurbits (Watermelon mosaic-2, Cucumber mosaic, Zucchini yellow mosaic, Papaya ringspot, and Squash mosaic), the spray treatment also significantly reduced the amount and severity of the symptoms of viral diseases. Our analyses reveal that (1) there is variation for resistance to herbivores and pathogens among the five families used in the Study, indicating that there is broad-sense heritability for resistance; (2) inbred plants suffer greater herbivore damage and have more symptoms of viral infection than outbred plants, i.e., there is inbreeding depression for herbivore/pathogen resistance; (3) the impacts of insecticide applications and inbreeding on reproduction are mostly additive; (4) both male and female functions are significantly affected by the spray treatment and inbreeding; and (5) the adverse effects of both inbreeding and the increased exposure to herbivores/pathogens in the no-spray treatment are greater for female function than for male function, indicating that the impact of genetic and environmental stress can differentially affect the two sexual functions. Together, these findings have important implications for the evolution of selfing, the conservation of small populations, and the establishment and transmission of diseases within populations.

AB We examined the relative strengths of top-down and bottom-up effects acting on insect herbivores feeding on five species of plants growing in coastal or upland regions of a Florida salt marsh. Three of the plant species, Borrichia frutescens, Coccoloba uvifera, and Baccharis halimifolia, grew close to the shore, while the two remaining species, Myrica cerifera and Persea borbonia, grew in upland areas with lower salinity and no tidal input. For each species, we added nitrogen fertilizer and reduced parasitism with sticky traps in a fully factorial design, and assessed the relative impacts of these bottom-up and top-down manipulations on the most common herbivores of each plant. We then used a within-study meta-analysis to integrate the results and quantitatively compare the strengths of top-down and bottom-up effects on the herbivores of these coastal and upland plants.
   Both fertilization and reduction of parasitism resulted in significant increases in herbivore densities, and the effects of these treatments were only slightly more pronounced for herbivores of the upland plant species than the coastal plant species. The greatest difference, however, between coastal and upland systems was in the strength of the interaction between nutrients and parasitism. Fertilization strongly increased the effects of parasitism for herbivores of upland plants, but not coastal plants. Correlations between effect sizes and ambient salinity and foliar nitrogen levels showed that environmental stress levels may be principally responsible for the strength of interaction between bottom-up and top-down forces, but nutrient levels likely play a lesser role.

AB Interactions among organisms depend on their spatial distributions. In particular, meaningful interpretations of the role of these interactions in structuring population, community, and ecosystem dynamics depend on the scale of analysis. Here, I develop two statistical methods for analyzing patterns in the aggregation and association of organisms inhabiting pelagic ecosystems that are inherently three dimensional. The first method only utilizes data on the nearest neighbors of individuals and works well for multiple comparisons over species or time, but it is not designed to test for departures from a Poisson random distribution toward uniformity. The second approach, however, takes advantage of the measured distances among all of the sampled individuals in the population and can test for departures toward uniformity. I also develop an edge correction to account for the biases associated with sampling by hydroacoustics, an effective means for measuring the three-dimensional positions of organisms in pelagic ecosystems. I used empirical data on the locations of predatory and prey fishes obtained with hydroacoustics in Lake Washington to illustrate how three-dimensional patterns of aggregation and association of predators and their prey can be assessed with these metrics. I found that prey fish were aggregated only during the day and at spatial scales of I m or less. Their potential predators, on the other hand, were aggregated at all spatial scales up to 5 m during the day, but only at scales <3 m at night. Predators and their prey were positively associated with one another at scales of 0.5-1 m during the day, but not at all during the night, reflecting the visual foraging nature of the predators and their high mobility relative to their prey. Furthermore, predators and prey were negatively associated during the night and at scales >2 m during the day, which may reflect predator avoidance. These results highlight how high-resolution, three-dimensional data on the spatial positions of aquatic organisms can improve understanding of the spatial scaling of interactions among organisms in pelagic ecosystems.

AB We aimed to assess whether prey organisms with limited large-scale dispersal abilities are locally adapted to prevailing predator regimes by studying how chemical cues from predatory fish affected the behavior of Gammarus pulex (Amphipoda) from ponds with and without fish. We also examined, in the laboratory, the F1 generation from each pond by incubating them with or without cues from predatory fish. The potential benefits of a behavioral avoidance response were also assessed in an experiment in which G. pulex from the different ponds and incubations were exposed to fish predation. G. pulex from fish ponds increased their refuge use when exposed to fish cues, whereas populations from fishless ponds reduced their refuge use. The F1 generation responded similarly to their parents. Only the F1 generation from fish pond populations responded with more pronounced antipredatory behavior when raised in fish water. Moreover, both the original and the F1 generation of fish pond G. pulex survived longer when exposed to fish predation than those from fishless ponds, independent of whether they were raised in fish water or not (F1). Our results suggest that the behavioral response to predator cues in G. pulex is an inherited trait, i.e., a local adaptation to prevailing predator regimes.

AB Tree radial growth and seedling establishment of Nothofagus pumilio at alpine treeline near 40degrees S latitude in Chile and Argentina show time- and site-dependent relationships to interannual- and decadal-scale climate variation. Six treelines were sampled at two spatial scales corresponding to regional and local climates. A shift in climate from cool-wet to warm-dry conditions facilitated comparison of climate-vegetation relationships during two distinct periods: 1957-1976 and 1977-1996. For each treeline, tree radial growth and seedling establishment were correlated against monthly and seasonal temperature, precipitation, moisture availability, and two indices of El Ni (n) over tildeo-Southern Oscillation (ENSO): southern oscillation index (SOI) and sea surface temperature (SST). Four key aspects of climatic influences on N. pumilio radial growth and seedling establishment were as follows. (1) The relationship between krummholz radial growth and temperature variation was nonlinear. (2) Moisture availability was the dominant climatic factor influencing seedling establishment, although temperature-precipitation interactions resulted in variability among study areas. (3) Climate conditions that facilitated Nothofagus pumilio seedling establishment were distinct, and often opposite, from those that enhanced radial growth. (4) The relationships of radial growth and seedling demography with climate and ENSO differed among study areas and have been unstable over the past 40 years. Observed spatial and temporal instabilities in vegetation-climate relationships demonstrate the complexity of treeline dynamics in northern Patagonia under a changing climate. We conclude that a directional increase in temperature, as predicted by current global climate scenarios, will not necessarily result in an upslope expansion of the N. pumilio forests growing at altitudinal treeline in northern Patagonia.

AB Soil microbes may affect the way exotic invasive plants interact with native neighbors. We investigated the effects of soil fungi on interactions between the invasive weed Centaurea maculosa (spotted knapweed) and six species native to the intermountain prairies of the northwestern United States. We also compared the effect of C. maculosa on the composition of the soil microbial community to that of the native species. In the field, fungicide (Benomyl) reduced AM mycorrhizal colonization of C. maculosa roots by >80%. Fungicide did not significantly reduce non-AM fungi. When grown alone, the biomass of C. maculosa was not affected by the fungicide application. However, depending on the combination of native competitor and fungicide, C. maculosa biomass varied from 10-fold decreases to 1.9-fold increases. In untreated soils, C. maculosa grew larger in the presence of Festuca idahoensis or Koeleria cristata than when alone. When fungicide was applied these positive effects of Festuca and Koeleria on C. maculosa did not occur. A third native grass, Pseudoroegneria spicata, had much stronger competitive effects on C. maculosa than Festuca or Koeleria, and fungicide reduced the competitive effects of Pseudoroegneria. Fungicide increased Centaurea biomass when competing with the forb Gallardia aristata. However, fungicide did not affect the way two other forbs; Achillea millefolium and Linum lewisii, interacted with C. maculosa. Rhizosphere microbial communities in the root zones of the three native bunchgrass species differed from that of C. maculosa. However, despite the strong effects of soil fungi in field interactions and differences in microbial community composition, soil biota from different plant rhizospheres did not affect the growth of C. maculosa in the absence of native competitors in greenhouse experiments. Our results suggest that successful invasions by exotic plant species can be affected by complex and often beneficial effects of local soil microbial communities. These effects were not manifest as simple direct effects, but become apparent only when native plants, invasive plants, and soil microbial communities were interacting at the same time.

AB Future increases in atmospheric CO2 may not lead to enhanced plant performance, as has been predicted, when herbivory is considered as, an interactive factor. This study provides experimental evidence that herbivory by the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, either decreased or suppressed the lifetime fitness response of Arabidopsis thaliana to elevated CO2 (significant CO2 x herbivory interaction). In addition, even though A. thaliana genotypes had significant differences in their fitness response to increased CO2 the inclusion of herbivory cancelled this genotype-specific response to enriched CO2 conditions. These results have direct implications for evolutionary outcomes in plant populations exposed to elevated CO2 and emphasize the need to evaluate CO2 responses in light of other environmental factors that plants may commonly encounter in natural situations.

AB Normative, invasive plant species often increase in growth, abundance, or habitat distribution in their introduced ranges. The enemy-release hypothesis, proposed to account for these changes, posits that herbivores and pathogens (natural enemies) limit growth or survival of plants in native areas, that natural enemies have less impact in the introduced than in the native range, and that the release from natural-enemy regulation in areas of introduction accounts in part for observed changes in plant abundance. We tested experimentally the enemy-release hypothesis with the invasive neotropical shrub Clidemia hirta (L.) D. Don (Melastomataceae). Clidentia hirta does not occur in forest in its native range but is a vigorous invader of tropical forest in its introduced range. Therefore, we tested the specific prediction that release from natural enemies has contributed to its expanded habitat distribution. We planted C. hirta into understory and open habitats where it is native (Costa Rica) and where it has been introduced (Hawaii) and applied pesticides to examine the effects of fungal pathogen and insect herbivore exclusion. In understory sites in Costa Rica, C. hirta survival increased by 12% if sprayed with insecticide, 19% with fungicide, and 41% with both insecticide and fungicide compared to control plants sprayed only with water. Exclusion of natural enemies had no effect on survival in open sites in Costa Rica or in either habitat in Hawaii. Fungicide application promoted relative growth rates of plants that survived to the end of the experiment in both habitats of Costa Rica but not in Hawaii, suggesting that fungal pathogens only limit growth of C. hirta where it is native. Galls, stem borers, weevils, and leaf rollers were prevalent in Costa Rica but absent in Hawaii. In addition, the standing percentage of leaf area missing on plants in the control (water only) treatment was five times greater on plants in Costa Rica than in Hawaii and did not differ between habitats. The results from this study suggest that significant effects of herbivores and fungal pathogens may be limited to particular habitats. For Clidemia hirta, its absence from forest understory in its native range likely results in part from the strong pressures of natural enemies. Its invasion into Hawaiian forests is apparently aided by a release from these herbivores and pathogens.

AB Current research into indirect phytopathogen-herbivore interactions (i.e., interactions mediated by the host plant) is carried out in two largely independent directions: ecological/mechanistic and molecular. We investigate the origin of these approaches and their strengths and weaknesses. Ecological studies have determined the effect of herbivores and phytopathogens on their host plants and are often correlative: the need for long-term manipulative experiments is pressing. Molecular/cellular studies have concentrated on the role of signaling pathways for systemic induced resistance, mainly involving salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, and more recently the cross-talk between these pathways. This crosstalk demonstrates how interactions between signaling mechanisms and phytohormones could mediate plant-herbivore-pathogen interactions. A bridge between these approaches may be provided by field studies using chemical induction of defense, or investigating whole-organism mechanisms of interactions among the three species. To determine the role of phytohormones in induced resistance in the field, researchers must combine ecological and molecular methods. We discuss how these methods can be integrated and present the concept of "kaleidoscopic defense." Our recent molecular-level investigations of intern actions between the herbivore Gastrophysa viridula and the rust fungus Uromyces rumicis on Rumex obtusifolius, which were well studied at the mechanistic and ecological levels, illustrate the difficulty in combining these different approaches. We suggest that the choice of the right study system (possibly wild relatives of model species) is important, and that molecular studies must consider the environmental conditions under which experiments are performed. The generalization of molecular predictions to ecologically realistic settings will be facilitated by "middle-ground studies" concentrating on the outcomes of the interactions.

AB Resource edibility is a crucial factor in ecological theory on the relative importance of bottom-up and top-down control. Current theory explains trophic structure in terms of the relative abundance and succession of edible and inedible species across gradients of primary productivity. We argue that this explanation is incomplete owing to its focus on inedibility and the assumption that plants and herbivores have fixed defense levels. Consumer-induced defenses are an important source of variation in the vulnerability of prey and are prevalent in natural communities. Such induced defenses decrease per capita consumption rates of consumers but hardly ever result in complete inedibility. When defenses are inducible a prey population may consist of both undefended and defended individuals. Here we use food chain models with realistic parameter values to show that variation in consumption rates on different prey types causes a gradual instead of stepwise increase in the biomass of all trophic levels in response to enrichment. Such all-level responses have been observed in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and in microbial food chains in the laboratory. We stress that, in addition to the known food web effects of interspecific variation in edibility, intraspecific variation in edibility is another form of within-trophic-level heterogeneity that also has such effects. We conclude that inducible defenses increase the relative importance of bottom-up control.

AB Evidence for competitive lotteries among reef fishes has remained elusive despite this being the group of organisms for which the lottery model was first developed. I used a combination of laboratory and field experiments to test the mechanisms of coexistence between two closely related species of coral-dwelling goby, Gobiodon histrio and G. erythrospilus, that occur in similar abundance at Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef. These two species exhibited similar patterns of habitat use and nearly identical ability to compete for vacant corals. Furthermore, there was a priority effect where the first species to occupy a vacant coral excluded an interspecific intruder of similar body size. The relative abundance of recruit and juvenile G. histrio and G. erythrospilus in the field matched the relative abundance of adults, as expected where there is no post-recruitment displacement by a competitive hierarchy. Finally, a reciprocal competitor-reduction experiment confirmed that G. histrio and G. erythrospilus compete for vacant space, with the removal of either species leading to an increase in the abundance of the other species. Therefore these two species are nearly ecologically equivalent and appear to coexist by means of a competitive lottery for vacant space.

AB The nonlethal effects of predation threat can be pervasive but are also easily overlooked. We investigated effects of predation threat on feeding by guppies (Poecilia reticulata), and how threat-induced temporal shifts in feeding activity affect reproductive behavior and growth. Contrary to the view of the guppy as a "diurnal" species, our observations revealed that guppies free from severe predation threat expand their foraging into the nocturnal period. We found such nocturnal foraging to be as profitable as diurnal foraging, and guppies. under threat incurred a substantial growth penalty when predators inhibited night feeding. Denial of night feeding also decreased daytime courtship by males, facultatively duplicating a classical observation comparing courtship intensity in contrasting predator regimes, but providing a novel mechanism for the effect. Our findings support the view that evaluations of predator effects on life histories should consider potential predator-caused alterations in size-specific energetic gain,. along with the classical consideration of predator-altered mortality rates. The results of this study show that predation threat can induce a large, facultative shift in the temporal niche and vital rates of a prey species. We discuss some implications of, the, effect in the broader contexts of predator facilitation, evolution of life histories, and trait-dependent decisions to boost daily intake by expanded feeding times.

AB Biological invasions represent both an increasingly important applied problem and a tool for gaining insight into the structure of ecological communities. Although competitive interactions between invasive and native species are considered among the most important mechanisms driving invasion dynamics, such interactions are in general poorly understood. The European honey bee (Apis mellifera) is a widespread and economically important invader long suspected to competitively suppress many native bee species. Yet the extent to which this introduced species alters native communities remains controversial, reflecting ongoing debate over the importance of resource competition in regulating pollinator populations. I experimentally tested the effects of competition with Apis on colony foraging behavior and reproductive success of a native eusocial bee, Bombus occidentalis Greene, in coastal California. B. occidentalis colonies located near experimentally introduced Apis hives had lower mean rates of forager return and a lower ratio of foraging trips for pollen relative to nectar. Both male and female reproductive success of B. occidentalis were also reduced with greater proximity to introduced Apis hives. Reproductive success correlated significantly with measures of colony foraging behavior, most strongly with the relative allocation of foraging effort to pollen collection. This pattern suggests that B. occidentalis colonies exposed to competition with Apis experienced increased nectar scarcity and responded by reallocating foragers from pollen to nectar collection, resulting in lowered rates of larval production. These results provide evidence that Apis competitively suppresses a native social bee known to be an important pollinator, with the potential for cascading effects on native plant communities. This work also contributes to a greater understanding of the role competitive interactions play in pollinator communities, particularly for social bees.

AB The ability of animal species to disperse through matrix habitats is likely to have important implications for species' responses to habitat fragmentation. Within fragmented forests, open fields are among the most common matrix habitats. However, few empirical studies have measured the effects of open habitats on dispersal success of forest-dwelling species. We used two experiments to determine the effects of open habitats and distance on dispersal and colonization by red-backed salamanders, Plethodon cinereus. In the first experiment, salamanders were displaced from habitat edges 25m and 55m into an open field and farther into the forest. Return rates from salamanders crossing the field vs. the forest were then used to determine the barrier effects of open habitats. Although return rate declined with distance, salamanders returned successfully through open habitat as often as they returned Successfully through forest. In the second experiment, we constructed "islands" of forest-like habitat within an open field. As in the previous experiment, colonization declined with distance. However, salamanders did colonize most of these field plots within one year. Initial colonists tended to be in the size range of young adults, suggesting, that there may be a distinct dispersal phase for terrestrial salamanders. Collectively, these results suggest that even relatively sedentary species may be able to move through matrix habitats that are otherwise little used. Given that red-backed salamanders appear to be relatively abundant in fragmented forests, We suggest that movement through open habitats could help to offset some of the negative effects of habitat fragmentation.

AB Outcrossing in plants is influenced by the availability of pollinators and compatible mates. both of which may be modified by the population and community Context in which plant-pollinator interactions occur. Although indirect interactions among plants through shared pollinators are often expected to be competitive, pollinator sharing may be beneficial when plant species jointly attract or maintain populations of pollinators. In this study. I tested the hypothesis that pollinator-sharing congeners facilitate reproduction in a focal taxon. Clarkia xantiana ssp. xontiana, and that positive interactions are most pronounced in small and sparse populations. Population Surveys revealed that C. x. xantiana frequently coexists with pollinator-sharing congeners except at the periphery of its range. Populations varied extensively in size and density, with small populations more likely associated with pollinator-sharing congeners conversely, Populations occuring,11 alone were more likely large. Flowering schedules in Clarkia communities ranged from segreated to aggregated. Although there was not strong evidence of character displacement, modes in flowering, time were often staggered among Clarkia species resulting in a protracted flowering season within plant communities. Studies of bee pollinator availability in populations and pollen limitation to reproduction in 39 replicate populations revealed that populations occuring with multiple congeners had high pollinator availability and low pollen limitation of reproduction compared to populations occuring alone. Population size was inversely related to pollen limitation but did not affect pollinator availability, suggesting that Allee effects were caused by mate limitation. Intraspecific interactions were also positive at a fine spatial scale where pollen deposition increased with the density of closely neighboring conspecifics across 11 populations. Overall, inter- and intraspecific interactions through shared pollinators were generally facilitative, suggesting that population viability and title coexistence of ecologically similar Clarkia species may be promoted by positive reproductive interactions.

AB In ecological theory species interaction strengths are typically described by constants or functions that depend on the densities of the two interacting species. However, if species' traits (phenotypes) are plastic, then modifications in these traits (induced by the presence of another species) could affect interaction strengths of the focal species with a number of other species in the system. The magnitudes of such higher-order effects on interaction strengths have not been reported and are not straightforward to measure. We present a methodology to quantify changes in consumer-resource interaction coefficients (a metric of interaction strength) due to effects of predators on consumer (i.e., the prey of the predator) phenotype (e.g., nonlethal or trait-mediated effects). Application of this method to studies in diverse systems indicates that predators can strongly reduce consumer-resource interaction coefficients, often in the range of 20-80%. We use analytic and simulation models to show that effects on interaction coefficients of this magnitude can lead to trait-mediated effects that contribute more strongly than density-mediated effects to the net effects of predators on consumers and their resources, and even qualitatively change model predictions. Our results strengthen previous claims that trait-mediated effects strongly influence species interactions and suggest that recent calls to quantify interaction strengths must be broadened to include examination of the variation in interaction strengths due to their dependence on densities of other species (most notably predators) in food webs.

AB Nonlethal (trait-mediated) effects of predators on prey populations, particularly with regard to prey dispersal, scarcely have been considered in spatial ecological studies. In this study, we report on the effects of spider predators on the mortality, dispersal, and spatial population dynamics of Prokelisia crocea planthoppers (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) in a prairie landscape. Based on a three-generation survey of host-plant patches (Spartina pectinata; Poaceae), the density of cursorial and web-building spiders declined significantly with increasing patch size (a pattern the opposite of that for the planthopper). Independent of patch size effects, an increase in the density of web-building and cursorial spiders had a negative effect on planthopper density in one of three generations each. Finally, the likelihood of extinction of local (patch) populations of planthoppers increased significantly with an increase in the density of web-building spiders. Planthoppers in small host-plant patches with high densities of web-building spiders were especially at risk of extinction. To evaluate whether spider effects on planthopper spatial dynamics were mediated by predation and/or spider-induced dispersal, we performed a field experiment in which host-plant patches were either caged or left open and received one of three spider density treatments (removal, ambient levels, or high = triple ambient levels). For the caged patches, there was a nonsignificant decline in planthopper recaptures with increasing spider density, suggesting that mortality effects of spiders on planthoppers were weak. In contrast, planthopper recaptures in open patches declined by 85% between the removal and high spider treatments. This significant decline was mostly attributed to spider-induced emigration. We conclude that, at high spider densities, spiders are likely to have a greater impact on planthopper densities through induced emigration than consumption. Because small cordgrass patches support high spider densities and favor high planthopper emigration rates, the nonlethal effects of spiders may play a very important role in determining critical patch size, source-sink properties of cordgrass patches, and the spatial distribution and spread of planthoppers.

AB We studied the resilience of southeastern Norwegian old-growth Picea abies forest floor vegetation to experimental disturbance. Five treatments, differing in depth of removal of vegetation and soil layers and making up a gradient in disturbance severity, and three controls, were replicated 10 times. The experiment was analyzed with respect to the full species composition before and for seven years after treatment. The soil-buried propagule bank and local, environmental conditions were recorded before treatment. Total cover of vascular plants and bryophytes and lichens increased slowly after treatment and was still below pre-disturbance levels after seven years. The rate of succession, measured as change in floristic dissimilarity between recordings made in successive years, declined with time for all treatments. The magnitude of vegetation change was strongly influenced, by disturbance severity. DCA ordination revealed a main gradient in species composition from undisturbed forest floor to severely disturbed vegetation three years after disturbance, while in the fourth year, the direction of vegetation change turned in the direction of pre-disturbance positions. The turning point represented the maximum abundance of pioneer species (e.g., Luzula pilosa and Pohlia nutans) relative to dominant species before the disturbance (e.g., Dicranum majus and Hylocomium splendens). The return to pre-disturbance positions from the fourth year was, however, slow and will probably take 5-25 more years to be completed if current trends continue. DCA ordination revealed two additional, interpretable, gradients in vegetation; one related to pulses of regeneration from the soil-buried propagule banks the other represented a gradient in pre-disturbance environmental conditions. We demonstrate that one vegetation gradient related to time after disturbance is insufficient to account for the full complexity of revegetation processes following disturbance.

AB One of the most commonly predicted effects of global ocean warming on marine communities is a poleward shift in the distributional boundaries of species with an associated replacement of cold-water species by warm-water species. However, these types of predictions are imprecise and based largely on broad correlations in uncontrolled studies that examine changes in the distribution or abundances of species in relation to seawater temperature. Our study used an 18-year sampling program in intertidal and subtidal habitats and before-after, control-impact analyses. We show that a 3.5degreesC rise in seawater temperature, induced by the thermal outfall of a power-generating station, over 10 years along 2 km of rocky coastline in California resulted in significant community-wide changes in 150 species of algae and invertebrates relative to adjacent control areas experiencing natural temperatures. Contrary to predictions based on current biogeographic models, there was no trend toward warmer-water species with southern geographic affinities replacing colder-water species with northern affinities. Instead, the communities were greatly altered in apparently cascading responses to changes in abundance of several key taxa, particularly habitat-forming subtidal kelps and intertidal foliose red algae. Many temperature-sensitive algae decreased greatly in abundance, whereas many invertebrate grazers increased. The responses of these benthic communities to ocean warming were-mostly unpredicted and strongly, coupled to direct effects of temperature on key taxa and indirect effects operating through ecological interactions.

AB Population models in ecology are rarely validated by comparing their predictions to long-term observations of changes in population size. We have used a variety of analytical tools to examine a 45-year time series of annual censuses of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) in the Gran Paradiso National Park in northwestern Italy. This ibex population grew from about 3300 to almost 5000 individuals in the 1980s during a decade of anomalously mild winters, and then began to decline in the 1990s. By 1997, the population size had returned to previous levels. Adult survival apparently increased and adult sex ratio may have changed to slightly favor males during the increase in population density. Yearly changes in total population were correlated with seasonal average snow depth and population density over the 39 years for which climate data were available. Our results show that the ibex population size was limited by both density dependence and deep snow. A model based on these factors fit to the first 19 years of data was used to forecast subsequent changes in total population based on initial population size and yearly snow depth. The model was able to predict the increase and subsequent decline in total population size over the final 20 years of the study but failed to reproduce population levels after the eruption. Our results suggest that the 1980s episode of population growth was primarily driven by increased adult survival, rather than increased recruitment.

AB Invasions by nonindigenous species impose large environmental and economic costs. In order to prevent invasions and target monitoring efforts most effectively, we need to forecast locations at the greatest risk of new invasions. To accomplish this, we need to estimate propagule pressure (inoculum size) and consider population processes, including possible Allee effects. Here, we develop a method to estimate the probability of population establishment, based on survival analysis and maximum likelihood techniques. We demonstrate theoretically the validity of this approach, considering environmental heterogeneity, estimation error, and nonlinearity. We then apply this method to zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasions of Michigan inland lakes. We fit our model using presence/absence data for 1589 lakes between 1992 and 1996 and propagule pressure estimates from gravity models of boater traffic. Using our fitted model, we estimated the probabilities of establishment and demonstrated that Allee effects were present in the zebra mussel system. We validated our model using invasion data from 1997-2001 (data not used to parameterize the model). For the validation time period, we correctly predicted up to nine times as many invasions as a null (random) model. Further, the Allee model assigned average probabilities of invasion four times higher for lakes that became invaded than for uninvaded, lakes, whereas the non-Allee model predicted probabilities for invaded lakes only two times higher. Thus, our model demonstrates the importance of considering the Allee effect and improves predictions of invasions.

ID BIRDS; SIZE
AB Distance-sampling methods are commonly used in studies of animal populations to estimate population density. A common objective of such studies is to evaluate the relationship between abundance or density and covariates that describe animal habitat or other environmental influences. However, little attention has been focused on methods of modeling abundance covariate effects in conventional distance-sampling models. In this paper we propose a distance-sampling model that accommodates covariate effects on abundance. The model is based on specification of the distance-sampling likelihood at the level of the sample unit in terms of local abundance (for each sampling unit). This model is augmented with a Poisson regression model for local abundance that is parameterized in terms of available covariates. Maximum-likelihood estimation of detection and density parameters is based on the integrated likelihood, wherein local abundance is removed from the likelihood by integration. We provide an example using avian point-transect data of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) collected using a distance-sampling protocol and two measures of habitat structure (understory cover and basal area of overstory trees). The model yields a sensible description (positive effect of understory cover, negative effect on basal area) of the relationship between habitat and Ovenbird density that can be used to evaluate the effects of habitat management on Ovenbird populations.

AB The availability of nonhost resource subsidies affects the ability of parasitoids to overcome egg and time limitation and maximize lifetime reproductive success. We combined field and laboratory experiments to examine the effects of floral resource subsidies on the reproductive fitness of aphid parasitoids. Under controlled laboratory conditions, sugar resources significantly increased longevity and potential fecundity (egg load) in the endoparasitoids Aphidius rhopalosiphi and Diaeretiella rapae (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae). Laboratory microcosm experiments showed that increased potential fecundity translated into significantly higher realized fecundity (i.e., rates of aphid parasitism) by A. rhopalosiphi receiving resource subsidies. Mechanisms of enhanced realized fecundity also operated under natural field conditions. Replicated field experiments on cultivated wheat, with host density controlled by experimental placement of aphids, showed that, in general, proximity to floral resource patches significantly increased rates of parasitism. Parasitism rates declined exponentially with increasing distance from floral patches, reaching zero beyond 14 m. Increased potential fecundity reduces the chances of parasitoids becoming egg-limited, whereas increased longevity reduces the chances of parasitoids becoming time-limited during host oviposition. Although the plasticity of egg load and longevity observed under varying conditions of resource availability is probably more relevant to parasitoid evolution, the individual fitness benefits from ephemeral resource patches are certainly important in the ecological enhancement of biological control agents.

AB The relative importance of large lianas (woody vines) increased by 100% for stem enumerations conducted during the 1980s and 1990s in widely scattered Neotropical forests. We use three independent types of data to evaluate the hypothesis that lianas have increased in importance in old growth forests on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Liana leaf litter production and the proportion of forest-wide leaf litter composed of lianas increased between 1986 and 2002. In contrast, liana seed production and liana seedling densities were much more variable through time with particularly high levels during and immediately after El Nino years. Longer time series will be required to detect shifts in life-form composition for highly dynamic seed and seedling communities. The Barro Colorado Island leaf production data are, however, consistent with the hypothesis that lianas are increasing in importance in Neotropical forests.

AB Theory and empirical evidence have long suggested that some species are extremely vulnerable to extinction because they have combinations of extinction promoting traits. However, ecologists have not considered whether the form of the relationship between traits is additive (not synergistic) or nonadditive (synergistic). We looked at how traits and their interactions were related to the difference in species' population growth rates between experimentally fragmented forest and continuous forest. Two traits acted synergistically; natural abundance and degree of specialization interacted so that beetle species that were rare and specialized had a greater reduction in their growth rates in fragments, compared to continuous forest, than the sum of the reductions in growth rates attributable to these traits. In other words, species that were both rare and specialized were especially vulnerable to extinction. From a conservation perspective, an implication of our findings is that making predictions about. extinction risk from a single trait, like abundance or population variability, may be risky because traits may act synergistically rendering species more, or less, vulnerable than predicted by that single trait. There is currently a great deal of interest in which traits predict the sensitivity of species to a given threat, but if we are going to look at risks in this way, then we also need to consider how traits interact, because this can alter the vulnerability of species.

AB There is little understanding of successional dynamics of N fixation in northern boreal forests. Recent evidence suggests that N fixation by cyanobacteria in association with the common feather moss Pleurozium schreberi contributes to a significant proportion of the total N economy. The Purpose Of the work herein was to determine how time since last fire influences N fixation rates in boreal forests. We evaluated seasonal N fixation rates oil a total of 12 natural forest preserves varying in time since last fire (35-355 years). Each site was monitored for N fixation activity using a calibrated acetylene reduction assay. Nitrogen fixation rates were found to increase linearly with time since fire. This increase in N fixation with succession is likely a function of degree of colonization by cyanobacteria and site factors Such as presence of available N. Surface applications of 4.5 kg N(.)ha (1.)yr(-1) as NH4NO3 Were found to eliminate N fixation while applications of P resulted in only a slight and temporary increase of N fixation rates. In contrast to common observation our findings suggest that N fixation in boreal forests becomes more important in late Succession. Limited N availability in late Succession is clearly one of the primary drivers of N fixation rates in boreal forest ecosystems. These findings may help to explain the origin of high rates of net N accumulation in Soil unaccounted for at northern boreal sites.

AB The two most fundamental levels of biodiversity, species diversity and genetic diversity, are seldom studied simultaneously despite a strikingly similar set of processes that underlie patterns at the two levels. Agricultural land use drastically reduces populations of forest herbs in the north-temperate zone, so that bottlenecks or founder events in forests on abandoned agricultural land (i.e., secondary forests) may have a longterm impact on both species diversity and genetic diversity. Using forest-herb community surveys and molecular-genetic analysis of populations of Trillium grandiflorum, a representative species of forest herb, I investigated the influence of land-use history, landscape context, and environmental conditions on diversity and divergence at the population and community levels. Secondary forests (70-100 years old) had reduced diversity of both genes and species relative to primary forests (i.e., stands never cleared for agriculture). The community in secondary forests had an overrepresentation of the most common species in the landscape, though divergence in species' relative abundances within stands suggested an influence of community drift via local bottlenecks. Secondary-forest populations of T. grandiflorum were more genetically divergent than those in primary forests, again indicating drift in small populations. Land-use history and the size of populations and communities drove correlations between species diversity and genetic diversity (and community divergence X genetic divergence), though the strength of correlations was relatively weak. These results extend the generality of positive species-genetic diversity correlations previously observed for islands, and they demonstrate a long-term legacy of land-use history at multiple levels of biodiversity.

AB Prominent models of herbivore regulation focus on predators, low plant biomass, or poor resource quality as factors that limit herbivore populations. We examined predictions of these tritrophic models for herbivores on the understory shrub, Piper cenocladum, which is defended by mutualistic ants (Pheidole bicornis) and three amide secondary metabolites. To examine sources of variation in P. cenocladum amide content and to compare the effects of amides vs. ants on herbivores, we used three linked experiments in the field and in shadehouses. We manipulated light, nutrient availability, and presence of symbionts for experimental plant fragments and shrubs and then quantified leaf amide concentration. We also examined relationships between amide content and damage by the three most common groups of folivores on P. cenocladum: generalist orthopterans, specialist coleopterans, and specialist lepidopterans. For all experiments, enhanced resources and absence of symbionts caused higher levels of amides. These increased chemical defenses had strong effects on generalist herbivores in this system, while the ant predators were more effective at depressing herbivory by specialists. The negative effects of amides on specialist lepidopterans were small, suggesting that these herbivores are adapted to chemical defenses in their host plant. It is possible that our results are part of a more general trend where top-down effects are stronger against specialist herbivores, while chemical defenses are more effective against generalists. We concluded that different models of herbivore regulation were supported by components of the P. cenocladum arthropod community, depending on resource availability and on the portion of the web examined.

AB Over the past 50 years, conceptual developments in stream ecology and ecosystem ecology have converged, thanks to biogeochemistry and the recognition that in situ processing on one hand and spatial translation of materials, processes, and influence along flowpaths on the other, unite to generate a holistic picture of ecosystem functioning at the landscape level. Early emphases in stream biogeochemistry involved organic carbon dynamics and whole-ecosystem budgets. These approaches were holistic but cumbersome and laborious and ignored several crucial issues, such as variation in organic matter quality. Nutrient-spiraling approaches rectified this shortcoming and provided a flowpath-specific technique for resolving the dynamics of both inorganic and organic materials and for comparing streams of different sizes and flow rates. The ability of nutrient-spiraling approaches to deal with multiple elements and fluctuating flows, including floods, remains elusive, however.
   There are several opportunities for stream ecology and biogeochemistry to continue cross-fertilization to the benefit of both disciplines. Chief among these is an emphasis on streams as spatially distributed heterogeneous systems, constantly shifting in shape and configuration through time. Hydrologic and material flowpaths integrate this heterogeneity as they alternately converge and diverge and perfuse the channel, hyporheic zone, riparian zone, and floodplain as they transport materials inexorably downstream. Conceptualizing streams as branched structures adds new insights to biogeochemical processing in space and raises several questions about network shape as an independent variable influencing biogeochemical dynamics such as nutrient retention efficiency. Junctions of streams emerge as potentially significant functional units when streams are viewed as networks. Ultimately, stream drainages finely dissect the land and receive water from soils in channelless upland regions which are themselves pervaded by convergent flowpaths, thus blurring the difference between streams and the landscapes they drain.
   Other lucrative future research opportunities are discussed including a plea for greater use of stoichiometric approaches and a consideration of geometry, disturbance, and legacies at multiple scales of space and time. We predict that future research in biogeochemistry will increasingly seek and find similarities among diverse ecosystem types by focusing on the spatially explicit flowpaths that integrate and connect them.

AB Although the structure and composition of plant communities is known to influence the functioning of ecosystems, there is as yet no agreement as to how these should be described from a functional perspective. We tested the biomass ratio hypothesis, which postulates that ecosystem properties should depend on species traits and on species contribution to the total biomass of the community, in a successional sere following vineyard abandonment in the Mediterranean region of France. Ecosystem-specific net primary productivity, litter decomposition rate, and total soil carbon and nitrogen varied significantly with field age, and correlated with community-aggregated (i.e., weighed according to the relative abundance of species) functional leaf traits. The three easily measurable traits tested, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, and nitrogen concentration, provide a simple means to scale up from organ to ecosystem functioning in complex plant communities. We propose that they be called "functional markers," and be used to assess the impacts of community changes on ecosystem properties induced, in particular, by global change drivers.

AB Many species of vertebrate animals skip reproduction in some years. We studied the pattern of reproduction exhibited by female four-toed salamanders (Hemidactylium scutatum). Data from a 10-year field study showed that females reproduced in sequential years with a frequency of 0.56 but skipped one or more years of reproduction with a frequency of. 0.44. This pattern was not correlated with whether a female attended or deserted her nest. When females skipped reproduction, they had higher growth, which can translate into higher fecundity. We experimentally examined whether female four-toed salamanders reproduced in sequential years if they had adequate resources after nesting and before the onset of winter. A manipulation of food level after the nesting period revealed that females fed a high food ration were twice as likely to return the next year to oviposit as females fed a lower food level. This study is the first to document experimentally that reproductive frequency varies with resource level in a vertebrate species.

AB Extrafloral (EF) nectar resources can affect the dynamics of species interactions at the community scale. Furthermore, selection acting on EF nectary traits may extend beyond simple mutualisms between plants and the enemies of herbivores to involve other community members that use EF nectar. We examine how EF nectaries influence and are influenced by interactions with multiple species, highlighting our review with original data from the association between ants and wild cotton (Gossypium, thurberi). Our survey of the literature suggested that EF nectar attracts a diverse assemblage of arthropods and may enhance the diversity and abundance of arthropod assemblages. However, experimental evidence on the importance of EF nectar to terrestrial food webs was equivocal. Exploring potential avenues for selection, we uncovered several costs and benefits of EF nectary traits that have received little empirical attention. These include a constraint faced by plants when attracting both pollinators and protectors via nectar, as well as an ecological cost of nectar when herbivores consume EF nectar as adults. Finally, we discuss how geographic variation in multispecies interactions may affect selection on EF nectary traits. In wild cotton, variation among populations in EF nectar composition was consistent with the benefits afforded by attracting ants; however, non-ant species may also mediate spatially variable selection on EF nectaries. Our synthesis underscores a need for studies that manipulate EF resources at the community level and investigate selection on EF nectaries in a multispecies and geographic context.

AB Previous laboratory studies have frequently determined the maximal running speeds of lizards. However, neither the extent to which animals use maximal speeds in nature nor the effects of arboreal habitat structure on undisturbed speeds of locomotion have been well documented. Furthermore, quantitative data describing the physical structure of arboreal habitats are lacking. Thus, we quantified available habitat, perch use, and the undisturbed locomotor behavior of four syntopic ecomorphs of Anolis lizards (A. sagrei, A. distichus, A. carolinensis, and A. angusticeps) in the field. Fifty percent of the cumulative perch length available in the habitat had values of diameter, length, and incline <0.8 cm, 54 cm, and 67degrees, respectively, indicating that narrow, short, and steep perches dominated the study site. The selection of all perch attributes by A. distichus was biased, whereas each of the remaining species randomly used at least one of the three attributes describing perch structure. Narrow breadth of resource use most often reflected the narrow breadth of available resources rather than selective use of resources. Interestingly, the behavioral and morphological specializations of A. angusticeps facilitate the use of the most common type of perch (twig) rather than a rare resource. Based on median values, the undisturbed speeds and distances of locomotion of A. sagrei (8.9 cm/s and 5.3 cm), A. distichus (31.5 cm/s and 2.8 cm), A. carolinensis (1.6 cm/s and 5.0 cm), and A. angusticeps (2.7 cm/s and 3.9 cm) were exceedingly slow and short, suggesting that neither maximal sprinting speeds nor endurance capacities were used frequently by any species in the field. The effects of habitat structure on undisturbed locomotor speeds and movement distances were highly species specific.

AB Mycorrhizae play a key role in ecosystem dynamics, and it is important to understand how environmental stress and climate change affect these symbionts. Several climate models predict that the intercontinental western United States will experience an increase in extreme precipitation events and warming temperatures. In 1996, northern Arizona, USA, experienced a 100-year drought that caused high local mortality of pinyon pine (Pinus edulis), a dominant tree of the southwest. We compared trunk growth, water potentials, and ectomycorrhizal dynamics for surviving trees at three high-mortality sites and adjacent low-mortality sites. Four major patterns emerged. First, surviving trees at sites that suffered high mortality exhibited reduced long-term growth and increased water stress relative to adjacent sites where little or no mortality occurred. Second, surviving trees from high-mortality sites had 50% lower ectomycorrhizal colonization and showed a pronounced shift in fungal community composition relative to low-mortality sites. Third, in support of an intermediate-host plant stress hypothesis, trees that experienced intermediate levels of stress supported two-fold greater ectomycorrhizal colonization than trees at the high or low end of a stress gradient. Fourth, we observed a strong correlation between trunk growth and ectomycorrhizal colonization and validated the resulting regression model with independent data. This relationship suggests that tree rings can be used to reconstruct past and predict future ectomycorrhizal colonization. Overall, our findings suggest that predicted climate changes might be accompanied by both qualitative and quantitative changes in ectomycorrhizal dynamics that could affect ecosystems by altering nutrient cycling, carbon dynamics, and host-plant performance.

AB Biological populations are strongly influenced by the random variation in their environment. The spectrum of frequencies in noise is particularly important to dynamics and persistence. Here we present an analysis of the variance spectra of a wide variety of long-term time series of environmental variables. Spectra were well approximated by the inverse power law 1/f(beta) within the appropriate range of frequencies f; however, the majority of spectra were "flattened" at low frequencies. With some qualification we found the spectral exponents (beta) to corroborate an earlier suggestion that terrestrial noise tends to be "white" (P < 0.5), while marine environments tend to be "red" (beta approximate to 1) or "brown" (beta approximate to 2). As well, we found a tendency for whiter noise in temperate latitudes than in either high or low latitudes. These results have wide-ranging consequences for ecosystem fragility and species conservation.

AB The relationship among asymmetric competition, habitat selection, and niche overlap is poorly understood. I conducted a response surface design experiment in artificial stream, channels using juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and steelhead trout (O. mykiss). to explore the density- and scale-dependent relationship among asymmetric competition, habitat selection, and niche overlap. In these sympatric populations, juvenile coho are larger, occupy mutually preferred deep, low-Velocity pools, and displace steelhead into shallow, high-velocity riffles. I measured habitat selection over a wide range of species' densities under two competitive scenarios: coho larger than steelhead (natural size asymmetry), and species size matched (natural size asymmetry removed). When coho had their natural size advantage, interspecific competition was. strongly asymmetric, and habitat selection by both species depended primarily. on coho density. Removing the size advantage of coho reduced by half the per capita effect of coho on steelhead habitat selection, which was then affected similarly by intra- and interspecific competition. However, habitat selection by coho still depended more on intra- than interspecific competition. The effect of asymmetric. competition on niche overlap was density- and scale-dependent. Asymmetric competition reduced niche overlap nonsignificantly across all densities at the habitat type scale (pools, riffles). At the microhabitat scale (velocity, distance, depth), asymmetric competition reduced niche overlap at low, but not high, densities. Because I manipulated the competitive asymmetry. in a single sympatric species pair, this experiment alters a competitive interaction while controlling for evolutionary history and thus provides a direct test of the effect of asymmetric competition on habitat selection and niche overlap. Combining a response surface design with different measures of niche overlap reveals how this effect can be both density- and scale-dependent.

TI Effects of spatial structures on the results of field experiments

AB Field experiments have been designed to account for spatial Structures since the inception of randomized complete block designs by R. A. Fisher. In recent years, our understanding of spatial structures led to refinements in the design and analysis of field experiments in the face of spatial patterning. In the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the response variable, is it possible to optimize the experimental design to maximize the response to the experimental factors? The questions addressed in this paper are: (1) What is the effect of spatial autocorrelation on type I error of the tests of significance commonly used to analyze the results of field experiments? (2) How effectively can we control for the effect of spatial autocorrelation by the design of the experiment? (3) Which experimental designs lead to tests of significance that have greater power? (4) What is the influence of Spatial autocorrelation on power of ANOVA tests of significance? This paper attempts to answer these questions through numerical simulations with known spatial autocorrelation. Response variable were simulated to represent the SLIM of separate effects: (1) an explanatory environmental variable (which could be used as a covariable in the analysis) with a deterministic structure Plus spatial autocorrelation, (2) an effect of the experimental treatments, (3) spatial autocorrelation in the response (e.g., biological) variable, and (4) it random error. The program repeatedly generated and analyzed Surfaces with given parameters (1000 replicates). The rejection rate of the null hypothesis of no effect of the treatment onto the response variable provided estimates of type 1 error and power. The simulations showed the following: (1) In the presence of spatial autocorrelation, or if repetitive deterministic Structures are present in the variables influencing the response, experimental units should not be positioned at random. (2) ANOVA that takes blocking into account is an efficient way of correcting for deterministic structures or spatial autocorrelation. (3) For constant effort, experimental designs that have more, smaller blocks, broadly spread across the experimental area, lead to tests that have more power in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. (4) Short-ranged spatial autocorrelation affects the power of ANOVA tests more than large-ranged spatial autocorrelation.

AB Hydrochemical monitoring of catchments provided a philosophical framework as well as hard data to understand and quantify the linked biological and abiotic processes that explain how atmospheric deposition of S and N changed soils and waters in nonagricultural areas across Europe. Initially, as a tool to collect relevant data in a representative and systematic ways hydrochemical monitoring provided evidence for widespread surface water acidification related to atmospheric pollution and long-range air transport. Recognizing the strong effect biota can have on their chemical environment, in the context of catchment biogeochemistry, these data provided new insights into individual processes of soil and water acidification and helped to quantify the relative importance of natural and anthropogenic sources of H.. Furthermore, combined with large-scale ecosystem manipulation and modeling, catchment biogeochemistry offered an effective tool to investigate risks of acidification and of nitrogen saturation of soils and waters.

AB Most predictions of plant species effects on ecosystems are based on single traits (e.g., litter chemistry) or suites of related traits (functional groups). However, recent studies demonstrate that predictions of species effects on ecosystems are improved by considering multiple traits. In order to develop this multiple trait approach, it is critical to understand how these multiple traits vary in relation to one another among species. The ecosystem effects of traits that strongly covary can likely be summarized by one of these traits. In contrast, it will be necessary to determine the ecosystem effects of specific trait combinations for those traits that vary independently across species.
   In the field, I established monocultures of eight herbaceous species common in California annual grasslands. Plant species significantly differed in their litter quantity and quality, live biomass, and effects on soil labile C, soil temperature, and soil moisture. Species effects on soil moisture and temperature were only significant at the times of the growing season when each of these limited plant and microbial activity. Some of these traits correlated with one another, such as litter biomass and species effects on soil temperature during the winter. However, for the most part, plant species exhibited unique combinations of these traits. For example, species with similar litter chemistry had the largest differences in plant biomass, soil moisture, and soil labile C. Species rankings for many traits changed over the growing season (e.g., biomass), so that the relationship among traits varied seasonally. The independent variation of these fraits suggests that predictions of plant species effects on ecosystems will likely be enhanced by an, understanding of how the ecosystem effects of plant traits may vary depending on the combination of traits.

AB For organisms with complex life cycles, larval history is increasingly being found to influence later juvenile or adult performance; however, most experiments maintain manipulations in the larval environment at a constant level. Here, I assess the effects of constant vs. variable larval food availability on the marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. In the laboratory, I raised larvae in four food concentrations: constant high, constant low, initial low switched to high, and initial high switched to low. After settlement, I outplanted juveniles to the field for two weeks. Changes in food availability affected larval size and lipid stores, and covariance between the two. Losses of juveniles were greater, and juvenile growth was lower, for those that had been reared as larvae in constant low food compared to those reared in constant high larval food. For the switched treatments, losses were greater, and growth was lower, for juveniles that had experienced initial low larval food relative to those that had experienced initial high larval food, regardless of average larval size or lipid stores from the different treatments. Thus, the timing of pulses of larval food may impact dynamics of later stages.

AB A major challenge in plant ecology is quantifying how roots obtain water and nutrients from the soil. Stable-isotope analysis of hydrogen and oxygen in plant and soil water is one of the best and least destructive methods for elucidating plant-soil interactions. Plant roots obtain water from various depths in the soil and the isotopic signature of plant stem water reflects the soil water sources. Current methods for inferring plant water sources based on stable isotopes ("simple linear mixing models") are limited. First, their formulation restricts the number of water sources to a maximum of three (e.g., surface, intermediate, deep-soil water); estimation of additional sources leads to an identifiability problem. Second, simple linear mixing models do not appropriately reflect uncertainty, and most importantly, they cannot be employed to elucidate behavior of the root system itself, such as root activity for water uptake. This study introduces the RAPID (root area profile and isotope deconvolution) algorithm, a powerful approach for reconstructing plant water uptake and root area profiles. The RAPID algorithm overcomes the nonidentifiability problem by incorporating a biophysical model for root water uptake into a Bayesian framework such that the biophysics and prior distributions place biologically realistic constraints on the profiles. Posterior distributions for the proportions of active root area and water acquired from each soil layer are obtained via Markov chain Monte Carlo. We apply the RAPID algorithm to data collected for a desert shrub and examine its sampling implications.

AB Biotic homogenization, the process of gradual replacement of native biotas by nonindigeous and locally expanding normative species, is rapidly diminishing the regional distinctiveness of global terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Although the empirical study of biotic homogenization is substantial and growing, the mechanisms underlying its dynamics remain poorly understood. We recently developed a theoretical model that predicts levels of biotic homogenization or differentiation (i.e., decreased community similarity) according to a series of distinct mechanisms. that describe the outcomes of various interactions between native species, normative species, and the environment. Here, we test this model using empirical data for freshwater fish faunas in the United States at three spatial scales: the entire continent, zoogeographic provinces in California, and watersheds within these provinces. Our analysis reveals that, in general, mechanisms depicting widespread introductions of cosmopolitan species and either no or differential spatial patterns of native-species extirpations explain fish-community homogenization across multiple spatial scales. Our results also highlight the potential effect of spatial grain on the perceived importance of different invasion-extinction scenarios shaping patterns of homogenization and differentiation. Next, we discuss the utility of the model for providing insight into the dominant ecological processes likely driving the homogenization of other major taxonomic groups that currently lack quantitative estimates of community change. Our study is the first to quantitatively examine the relative importance of different ecological mechanisms that can generate observed patterns of biotic homogenization. Using this model may allow advance prediction of future patterns of homogenization by explicitly considering underlying ecological processes and mechanisms.

AB Diel vertical migration (DVM) is a dynamic behavioral pattern found extensively in the world's oceans and lakes, yet the role of food and temperature distribution on DVM is still unclear. While DVM has been mostly studied in systems with surface food maxima, deep-water food maxima are quite common in lakes and oceans. In such ecosystems, optimal conditions of temperature and food are uncoupled. In a Swiss high-mountain lake (Oberer Arosasee) with a deep-water food maximum, we found that Daphnia galeata adults and juveniles exhibit DVM behavior almost throughout the year and migrated upwards, out of food-rich environments, at night. In a large indoor mesocosm experiment, we were able to show that Daphnia respond to fish-mediated cues by migrating into deeper water layers. In the presence of fish and using natural vertical food and temperature distributions in the mesocosms, we could reproduce the vertical distribution of adult Daphnia observed in the field. The indoor experiments show that food and temperature modulate the actual depth at which the animals stop migrating, whereas fish and ultraviolet radiation likely determine the timing of migration (its synchronization with dawn and dusk). Overall, our results show that the nighttime movement into the surface waters contributes to the fitness of Daphnia, given the costs and benefits associated with the trade-off between food and temperature.

AB We compared physiological, demographic, and ecological variables of larks to gain insights into life history variation along an aridity gradient, incorporating phylogenetic relationships in analyses when appropriate. Quantifying field metabolic rate (FMR). and water influx rate (WIR) of parents feeding nestlings as measures of parental effort, we found that parental FMR and WIR of larks decreased with increasing aridity. Water and energy requirements of 6-8 d old nestlings were reduced in desert species. Nestling growth rate, clutch size, and number of clutches decreased with increasing aridity, and nest predation rates increased with increasing aridity. We combined FMR and WIR of parents and chicks, energy and water accumulated during growth, and brood size to establish energy and water budgets of parent-brood units. Parent-offspring energy budgets equaled 261 kJ/d for Hoopoe Lark, 164 kJ/d for Dunn's Lark, 388 kJ/d for Skylark, and 347 Old for Woodlark, a 27% reduction in the desert species when taking into account mass differences. Family unit WIRs were 46.6 g/d for Hoopoe Lark, 37.3 g/d for Dunn's Lark, 101.6 g/d for Skylark, and 83.2 g/d for Woodlark. Parent-brood units of arid-zone species used 28-51% less water per gram mass than species from mesic areas. These results support the hypothesis that decreasing food and water availability favor lower energy and water requirements of parents and young, reduced growth rates, and smaller clutch sizes with increasing aridity. The decrease in parental effort with increasing aridity might reflect a lower fitness value of a single brood for arid-zone species than for larks from mesic habitats, suggesting that the probability of adult survival is higher in arid than in mesic areas.

AB Incremental (distance-dependent) costs and benefits of dispersal have received less attention than those that are qualitative. We present a dynamic programming model of settling behavior using parameters estimated from a field study of dispersal in desert isopods, Hemilepistus reaumuri, which walk up to thousands of meters before settling in new or already-established burrows each spring. The model shows that incremental costs of dispersal lead to right-skewed population dispersal patterns, in contrast to cost-free systems or those with unitary costs (i.e., a one-time cost of leaving a group or patch). In the model, continuous variation in habitat quality, as opposed to discrete suitable vs. unsuitable sites, allows for trade-offs with dispersal costs that lead to shifts in the likelihood of settling in a patch of a given quality. Thus, measurement of quantitative costs and benefits of movement are needed to understand population dispersal distributions. These costs or benefits may be observable during or after movement, and we examined both pre- and postsettling incremental consequences of dispersal. The daily mortality rate of traveling isopods was 4.2% during the dispersal season, higher than that of settled individuals. Successful settlers traveled more slowly, but burrows started in midseason were most likely to succeed. More distant burrows failed more often, suggesting either an additional cost of movement or a difference in the quality of individuals traveling different distances. The predicted mean dispersal duration from the simulations matched observed values closely, but was based on an unrealistic assumption of perfect knowledge of habitat quality, suggesting some other factor favors longer times before settling. Reproductive success was much higher in re-used burrows than in new burrows, making them a possible incentive for long-distance movements.

AB Dendrochronology generally operates under the assumption that climategrowth relationships are age independent, once growth trends and/or disturbance pulses have been accounted for. However, several studies have demonstrated that tree physiology undergoes changes with age. This may cause growth-related climate signals to vary over time. Using chronology statistics and response functions, we tested the consistency of climate-growth responses in tree-ring series from Larix decidua and Pinus cembra trees of four age classes. Tree-ring statistics (mean sensitivity, standard deviation, correlation between trees, and first principal component) did not change significantly with age in P. cembra, whereas in L. decidua they appeared to be correlated with age classes. Response function analysis indicated that climate accounts for a high amount of variance in tree-ring widths in both species. The older the trees are, the higher the variance explained by climate, the significance of the models, and the percentage of trees with significant responses. Age influence on climate sensitivity is likely to be non-monotonic. In L. decidua, the most important response function variables changed with age according to a twofold pattern: increasing for trees younger than 200 years and decreasing or constant for older trees. A similar pattern was observed in both species for the relationship between tree height and age. It is hypothesized that an endogenous parameter linked to hydraulic status becomes increasingly limiting as trees grow and age, inducing more stressful conditions and a higher climate sensitivity in older individuals. The results of this study confirm that the climate signal is maximized in older trees, but also that a sampling procedure non-stratified by age (especially in multi-aged forests) could lead to biased mean chronologies due to the higher amount of noise present in younger trees. The issue requires more extensive research as there are important ecological implications both at small and large geographic scales. Predictive modeling of forest dynamics and paleo-climate reconstructions may be less robust if the age effect is not accounted for.

AB Centaurea corymbosa is an endemic plant species restricted to a 3-km(2) area in southern France. This species is known from only six. small populations that are highly differentiated genetically. Matrix models based on eight years of data (1994-2001) were used to assess the pattern of variation in the demographic vital rates of this species, and to investigate the causes of their variation. Asymptotic growth rates X varied widely between years and populations (0.613-1.424). Randomization tests were developed to test for spatial and temporal variation in the asymptotic growth rates. These tests rely on individual data on both survival and fecundity. As our demographic survey only allowed us to estimate,average fecundities, additional fecundity data collected from 1994 to 1996 were used to assess the distribution of individual fecundity expected within populations under demographic stochasticity or sampling error. Randomization tests showed that asymptotic growth rates were significantly different between populations and between years in C. corymbosa. In contrast, log-linear analysis performed only on transition data (i.e., excluding fecundity) suggested that the observed variations in transition probabilities were mostly explained by sampling error or demographic stochasticity rather than environmental stochasticity. This suggested that variations in fecundity among populations and among years may play a key role to explain temporal and spatial differences in X. Life-table response experiment analysis revealed that variations in fecundity and especially in the number of just-emerged seedlings per plant explained most of the observed variance in X. Spatial and temporal variations were detected for most lower-level vital rates, but causal factors that may account for these patterns a. re still unknown: no effect of genetic diversity was detected on the dynamics of the species, and correlation between lower-level vital rates and climatic data did not reveal any clear trends. Our study emphasizes the need to conduct long-term demographic surveys and to collect individual fecundity data to get more insights into the causes of variation of the demographic behavior of C. corymbosa.

AB Many plants offer rewards to attract ants that provide indirect defense against herbivores. These rewards include nectar and swollen thorn domatia, and their production can be inducible. Theory predicts that costly rewards should be relaxed if the risk of herbivory is reduced, although this has not been previously demonstrated. Acacia drepanolobium trees in East Africa produce two ant rewards, extrafloral nectar and swollen thorns. We compared the rewards offered by trees experimentally protected from mammalian browsing for seven years with those offered by unprotected trees. Protected trees produced 25% fewer nectaries per leaf and 25% fewer swollen thorns than did trees in browsed plots. Relaxation of indirect defenses when trees are protected from herbivores is consistent with the dual hypotheses that inducible defenses are dynamic and that plants can save costs by relaxing these defenses when they are not needed. Among trees exposed to mammalian herbivores, trees that were browsed within roughly the past year provided rewards for ants similar to those provided by trees exposed to herbivores but not browsed within the past year. This result suggests that relaxation of indirect defenses only occurs following more than one year of protection from mammalian herbivory.

AB Winter temperatures may reduce energy, costs for ectotherms. However, variable mid-temperate and low-latitude winters may interact with scaling of size, metabolism, and energy reserves to cause energy deficits and require trade-offs between foraging and predation. A dynamic optimization model explored how ration, fall fat, and both non- and size-selective predation influenced foraging (i.e., fast or forage) and energy allocation (i.e., length or fat) decisions that maximize winter survival of age-0 largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). During a mid-latitude (38degrees N) winter, a pond experiment in which age-0 fish occurred with or without adult conspecific predators tested a subset of the model.
   In the model without predators, winter foraging occurred, with small size only reducing survival when low ration and low fall fat caused small fish to exhaust reserves. With predation, all sizes foraged to maintain mass and fat reserves when ration was sufficiently high, with small fish also growing in length. When modeled predation was nonselective, size-dependent mortality varied in complex ways. In contrast, size-selective predators consistently reduced survival of small fish. Generally consistent with the model, fish in ponds without predators gained mass and energy content, while those with predators only maintained these parameters. All small individuals grew more than large counterparts in length. Mortality in ponds never depended on size but was similar to20% higher with predators. Energy deficits often demand active foraging during mid-temperate winters, with predation rather than energy depletion influencing size-dependent survival.

AB Recognition of the complex spatial and temporal variability of abundance and diversity found in many populations has led to a greater focus on the roles of heterogeneity, stochasticity, and disturbance in the structure and persistence of communities. This focus is directly relevant to coral reef communities that are characterized by very high species diversity in a spatially heterogeneous environment, display stochastic variability in community structure at small spatial and temporal scales, and are subject to major disturbances. We monitored coral and fish assemblages over 14 years on fixed sites spread over 80 km of the southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, and found evidence of large-scale resilience and predictable recovery of these assemblages. Sometime between November 1987 and October 1989, live coral cover on the shallow northeast flanks of some reefs in the southern GBR decreased from >80% to <10%, probably as a result of storm damage. We compared the fish and benthic communities present in these areas prior to the disturbance (1983-1984) with those present in 1992 and the subsequent changes through to 1998. Hard coral cover increased slowly from 1992 to 1994, then accelerated to be indistinguishable from pre-impact levels by 1998. The response of the coral assemblages was largely due to the predominance of tabulate Acropora species and their characteristics of rapid growth and competitive dominance. Patterns of species richness of the fish families Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Scaridae, and Pomacentridae mirrored that of hard coral, except the Pomacentridae had not recovered to pre-impact levels by 1998. Of the 26 fish species analyzed for changes in abundance, 88% decreased after the disturbance, then subsequently increased, with all but two recovering to pre-impact levels by 1998. Although processes such as settlement and immigration are ultimately responsible for replenishment of local populations, our data suggested that habitat plays a strong role in modifying fish assemblages. Thus, both coral and fish assemblages demonstrated resilience to large-scale natural disturbance and predictability in the structure of the assemblages, with most taxa approaching the asymptote of abundance and species richness that existed prior to the disturbance.

AB We investigated a link between facultative semelparity ("male die-off") in a small, endangered marsupial, Parantechinus apicalis (the dibbler), and the availability of resources on two small islands in Western Australia. Post-mating survival of male dibblers differed between the two islands, and the input of nutrients from nesting seabirds was a possible factor affecting available resources and therefore survival of male dibblers. Seabirds can increase significantly the concentration of nutrients in the soil and can ultimately lead to an increase in abundance of primary consumers and predators. We compared concentrations of soil nutrients, body condition, and post-mating survival of male dibblers on both islands. The body condition and post-breeding survival were significantly better on the island with many seabirds, where soil nutrients were up to 18 times higher, than on the adjacent island with fewer seabirds. Our results indicate a potential link between male die-off and resource availability. We suggest that marine-derived nutrients transported onto islands by nesting seabirds can alter the productivity as well as the life history traits of species in an island ecosystem.

AB A common framework toward understanding the ecological forces affecting herbivore population dynamics is to partition those forces according to their origin higher ("top-down"),or lower ("bottom-up") on the trophic chain. I employed that framework to describe phenotypic life history trade-offs in a large herbivore, moose (Alces alces). The relative importance of top-down and bottom-up ecological constraints to female moose in south-central Alaska was appraised at the population level by analyzing population size, growth, and winter habitat of moose, and the size and impact of their principal predator populations (wolves [Canis lupus] and brown bears [Ursus arctos]). At the individual level, longitudinal mortality and reproductive patterns of radio-collared individuals were studied to estimate vital rates and life history trade-offs that could be attributed to nutrition and predation, respectively. The population was essentially stable through the 1980s and early 1990s, and began declining in the period of this study (1994-2000). Nutritional constraints on productivity were evident in low twinning rates (9-24%) and delayed age of first reproduction (3.4 yr) relative to other moose populations. However, the decline of the population was due principally to high rates of summer mortality of calves, resulting in low recruitment in the fall (0.11-0.22 offspring/female) and increasing adult mortality. Bear and wolf densities were high and moderate, respectively, while human harvest of moose was limited to males. Modeled population growth indicated a very limited capacity for population recovery through increased reproduction when compared to the effects of reducing predation. Constraints on population growth were mirrored in life history trade-offs. Trade-offs that were attributed to bottom-up effects included reduced rates of both parturition and twinning as a consequence of maternal investment in the prior year. Important trade-offs also were detected between top-down factors and reproductive effort through significantly increased predation on adult females with calves and increased survival of yearlings when adults skipped or abandoned reproductive attempts and extended the duration of maternal care.

AB Ant communities are thought to consist of a competitive hierarchy of interacting species, with an assemblage of subordinate species being structured by a dominant species. Mensurative and behavioral studies suggest a significant role for competition in structuring ant communities, although there are few experimental studies to support this. contention. We examined the effect of the dominant ant Iridomyrmex purpureus on the ant fauna of sandstone outcrops in southeastern Australia. We conducted a mensurative survey using transect counts to compare ant assemblages at eight outcrops with, and eight without L purpureus. Using cages, we then successfully excluded the dominant ant from four outcrops and compared assemblages at these exclusion sites,with those at sites with and without L purpureus and with procedural control sites over a period of 12 months. We conducted behavioral studies comparing I. purpureus with six other common species in terms of their abilities to locate, recruit to, and defend bait. While initial surveys indicated both positive and negative effects of L purpureus on the activity of several subordinate species, exclusion of I. purpureus resulted only in changes in the abundance of other species of Iridomyrmex, which are behaviorally and ecologically similar to the dominant species. Iridomyrmex purpureus was faster at discovering bait than other species, but not always better at recruiting to the bait. It interfered with the foraging of all species tested; however, it displaced other Iridomyrmex from bait most often. While longer-term studies may provide more definitive results, exclusion of the dominant species over one year had strong effects only on ecologically similar species. Despite its behavioral dominance and association with several other species in the mensurative surveys, L purpureus was not shown to cause any other major changes in ant community structure.

AB The spatial distribution of. canopy trees in the temperate deciduous forests of the northeastern United States creates "neighborhoods" that vary in species composition as well as understory features. These neighborhoods may affect the distribution and abundance of generalist small-mammal seed predators by creating spatial variation in the availability of food resources, protective cover, and interactions with competitors. Small-mammal distribution and abundance may then influence tree population dynamics through variation in seed predation and seedling establishment. To. determine if small-mammal activity patterns, seed survival, and seedling recruitment varied with neighborhood structure, we designed a study conducted at two habitat levels: canopy-tree neighborhoods, which reflected variation in seed production, and understory neighborhoods, which reflected differences in protective cover and interactions among animals. We live-trapped small mammals during the summer and fall of 1995 and 1996, experimentally measured seed survival in the falls of 1995 and 1996, and quantified total tree seedling recruitment in the spring of 1997. We developed a new method for nonlinear Poisson regression to relate canopy and understory neighborhood composition to small-mammal distribution and activity,. seed survival, and seedling establishment. Small-mammal activity patterns changed between 1995 and 1996 in response to seed production. Canopy tree neighborhoods were a good predictor of overall small-mammal activity, and neighborhoods with high small-mammal activity had low seed survival. The canopy-tree neighborhoods with sufficient, seed rain and high seed survival displayed increased seedling recruitment. Understory structure was a poor predictor of seed survival and seedling recruitment but appeared to be the primary axis along which habitat partitioning among mammal species took place when population densities were low. This study demonstrates that small-mammal seed predators influence tree recruitment patterns through their actions as seed predators in temperate deciduous forests, and that local effects of small mammals on seedling recruitment can be predicted from the species composition of tree neighborhoods.

AB Virulent parasites cannot persist in small host populations unless the parasite also has a reservoir host. We hypothesize that, in hosts with complex life histories, one stage may act as an intraspecific reservoir for another. In amphibians, for example, larvae often occur at high densities, but these densities are ephemeral and fixed in space, whereas metamorphs are long-lived and vagile but may be very sparse. Parasite persistence is unlikely in either stage alone, but transmission between stages could maintain virulent parasites in seasonally fluctuating amphibian populations.
   We examined this hypothesis with a lethal ranavirus, Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV), that causes recurrent epidemics in larval tiger salamander populations, but which has no reservoir host and degrades quickly in the environment. Although exposure to ATV is generally lethal, larvae and metamorphs maintained sublethal, transmissible infections for >5 mo. Field data corroborate the persistence of ATV between epidemics in sublethally infected metamorphs. Three-quarters of dispersing metamorphs during one epidemic were infected, and apparently healthy metamorphs returning,to breed harbored ATV infections. Our results suggest that larval epidemics amplify virus prevalence and sublethally infected metamorphs (re)introduce the virus into uninfected larval populations. Intraspecific reservoirs may explain the persistence of parasites in and declines of small, isolated amphibian populations.

AB In fragmented landscapes, habitat patches are often destroyed and created through time, though most metapopulation models treat patch networks as static. Here we present a generally applicable, modified version of Hanski's Incidence Function Model (IFM) that incorporates landscape dynamics (i.e., habitat patch turnover), and we parameterize the model with data on patch occupancy patterns for forest plants in central Lincolnshire, UK. The modified IFM provided a better, or equally good, fit to species' patch occupancy patterns than logistic regression. Estimated colonization and extinction rates, and the results of logistic regression analyses. varied significantly among species with different life history traits. For example, species with low seed production and predominantly short-distance seed dispersal showed lower rates of colonization and extinction and were more likely to show effects of patch age and connectivity on patch-level presence than species with the opposite set of traits. Model Simulations demonstrate a profound negative influence of habitat turnover rate on metapopulation dynamics and persistence, particularly for slow-colonizing species. The incorporation of temporal habitat dynamics into the metapopulation paradigm will permit its application to organisms in a much wider ran-e of real landscapes.

AB Conservation strategies often call for the utilization of corridors and/or stepping stones to promote dispersal among fragmented populations. However, the extent to which these strategies increase connectivity for an organism may depend not only on the corridors and stepping stones themselves, but also on the composition of the surrounding matrix. Using an herbivore-host-plant system consisting of the planthopper Prokelisia crocea and its sole host plant, prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata), we show that the effectiveness of corridors and stepping stones for promoting planthopper dispersal among patches depended strongly on the intervening matrix habitat. In a low-resistance matrix (one that facilitates high rates of interpatch dispersal), both stepping stones and corridors promoted high connectivity, increasing the number of colonists by threefold relative to patches separated by matrix habitat only. The effectiveness of stepping stones and corridors was significantly lower in a high-resistance matrix (one that promotes low rates of interpatch dispersal), with stepping stones failing to improve connectivity for the planthoppers relative to controls. Thus, we conclude that the matrix is an integral component of landscapes and should be considered together with corridors and stepping stones in strategies designed to increase dispersal among fragmented populations.

   RISK; KELP FOREST; FOOD; COMPETITION
AB Canopy-forming plants and algae, in addition to their role as food, can positively affect higher trophic levels by providing protection from predation or stressful abiotic conditions. In the low rocky intertidal zone of the Pacific Northwest, the chiton Katharina tunicata is closely associated with the canopy-forming alga Hedophyllum sessile. In a 27-month field experiment, I used experimental devices to mimic characteristics of the Hedophyllum canopy and monitored the abundance and physiology of Katharina to determine the mechanism behind this association. The data show that this association is due to selection of shaded microhabitats by Katharina, and that neither predation nor Hedophyllum per se influenced the distribution of the chiton. Exclusion of visual predators had no effect on chiton abundance, and tests of the effects of shade independent of Hedophyllum presence indicated that the shade produced by the alga was critical to the chiton. Seasonal fluctuations in levels of 70 kDa 0.16 X 10(-19) g) heat shock proteins (Hsp70), indicate that Katharina experience sublethal physiological stress during the spring and summer. The corresponding use of shaded areas during spring and summer low tides suggests that the chiton's distribution is limited during these seasons by the availability of refugia from sublethal abiotic stresses. Subtle variations in environmental conditions are also important to this association; the strength of the positive interaction varied annually, becoming more positive in warm summers (1998 and 2000) and neutral in a cooler summer (1999). On a finer scale, physiological measurements indicate that the response of chitons to summertime temperatures depends on both absolute temperature change and the animal's recent thermal history. In particular, the seasonal onset of daytime low tides in the spring is associated with increased Hsp70 levels, indicating that this is a significant physiological event for Katharina. The importance of facultative positive interactions that allow consumers to escape from sublethal abiotic stresses will likely be variable in time but can have large impacts on communities both by affecting the small-scale distribution of consumers over the short term and potentially by affecting the persistence of organisms over the long term.

AB Belowground interactions can affect plants either directly or indirectly via their associated mycorrhizal fungi. However, few studies have experimentally examined the consequences of interspecific root interactions for these important mutualists in the field. We used a trenching experiment to examine how belowground interactions between pinyon pine and one-seed juniper affected the ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal communities of pinyon pine. Three major findings emerged: (1) pinyons responded to the reduction of juniper roots with a near doubling of fine root biomass in just two years, (2) this increase in pinyon roots translated into a potential two-fold increase in EM abundance, and (3) the EM fungal communities of trenched trees differed significantly from controls largely due to a decrease in ascomycete fungi. Because species of EM fungi vary in the benefits they provide, changes in EM communities could have long-term consequences for host-plant establishment, growth, and survival. Belowground interactions with juniper may contribute to the high mortality of pinyons and the reduced diversity of EM fungi associated with recent droughts.

AB Under R. H. Whittaker's "multiplicative" perspective of species diversity, regional (gamma) diversity is viewed as the product of within-assemblage (alpha) diversity and among-assemblage (eta) diversity. An additive perspective, which views alpha and beta as complements, has recently been endorsed for the study of spatial patterns in species diversity. Here we highlight the relation between the two measures of beta diversity, showing the multiplicative beta as a simple summary statistic of the relation between the additive components. We provide analytical solutions for approximate confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for both measures of beta diversity. We also present results of simulation studies that can help delimit the sample sizes needed for future studies, and which suggest the effect-size likely to be detected with samples of a given size.

AB Replenishment of benthic marine populations typically involves "settlement" from pelagic larval to benthic juvenile habitats. Mortality during this transition has been unknown because of the difficulty of measuring propagule supply in open water. For three weeks, we compared the nocturnal passage of presettlement fishes across the barrier reef encircling Moorea Island (French Polynesia) with the abundance of benthic recruits in the back-reef lagoon on the following morning. During, this time, >40,000 presettlement unicornfish, Naso unicornis entered our study area of similar to1 km(2) with half arriving on just two nights. Using coupled Beverton-Holt functions to describe the decay of each cohort, we were able to predict the daily abundance of recruits and their final age structure from the presettlement inputs. The best model estimated that similar to61% of the potential settlers were lost between their nocturnal arrival and the following morning, independent of cohort size. Postsettlement mortality was density dependent, varying between 9% and 20% per day. We attribute all mortality to predation and suggest that high risk associated with settlement has shaped colonization strategies. Because fishing targets the survivors of this population bottleneck, aquarium fisheries may be more sustainable when sourced from pelagic juveniles.

AB We modify a method of estimating size-age relations from a minimal set of individual increment data, recognizing that growth depends not only on size but also varies greatly among individuals and is consistent within an individual for several to many time intervals. The method is exemplified with data from a long-lived desert plant and a range of autocorrelation factors encompassing field-measured values. The results suggest that age estimates based on size and growth rates with only moderate autocorrelation are subject to large variation, which raises major problems for prediction or hindcasting for ecological analysis or management.

AB Although animals are widely assumed to select habitats in ways that enhance organismal fitness, there are few empirical data to demonstrate this link. We studied flat rock spiders (Hemicloea major, Gnaphosidae) from eastern Australia, where these highly modified (dorsoventrally flattened) spiders live under loose surface rocks on sandstone outcrops. Field surveys showed that the rocks used as diurnal retreat sites by spiders were relatively thin with low canopy cover and a rocky substrate and therefore were likely to experience high temperatures and large thermal fluctuations. Laboratory trials suggest that this nonrandom rock use is a direct response to thermal cues; juvenile spiders selected warmer over cooler retreat sites. To investigate consequences of habitat selection on fitness-related traits, we maintained cohorts of juvenile spiders at cycling-temperature regimes corresponding to those measured in the field under rocks that were fully, partially, or never exposed to direct sunlight (diel thermal ranges of 16.2degrees-37.8degreesC, 15.5degrees-31.2degreesC, and 15.2degrees-24.3degreesC). Survival rates were high for all groups over the eight-week study, but hotter conditions accelerated growth and development. Our data thus confirm that thermal cues are used in retreat-site selection and that selection of warmer retreat sites will confer fitness benefits to flat rock spiders.

AB This article explores the potential indirect effects due to changes in consumption-related traits of a focal prey species in each of two simple food webs. The systems considered are: one predator exploiting two independent prey, and one predator exploiting two prey that use a common limiting resource. In each system, the indirect effect of a change in a consumption-related parameter of one prey species on the population density of the other prey is determined. When prey only share a predator, the change in one prey's density produced by a change in the other prey's vulnerability to the predator is determined by whether or not that second prey is initially overexploited; i.e., whether its exploiter's intake decreases with an increase in the attack rate. Increases in the vulnerability of an overexploited prey decrease the predator population and thereby indirectly increase the population size of the second prey. Increases in the vulnerability of a prey that is not overexploited have the opposite effects on both the predator and second prey populations. Both of these outcomes can be reversed by strong direct density dependence in the predator, provided the predator exhibits satiation. In the food web with a shared food and a shared resource, increases in predator vulnerability of the more vulnerable prey species always increase the population size of the more resistant prey species. However, increases in the vulnerability of the more resistant prey can either increase or decrease the population size of the more vulnerable prey species. When the more resistant prey becomes better at capturing the resource, the less resistant may either increase or decrease. Overexploitation also explains these outcomes. General principles for understanding the consequences of changes in vulnerabilities or attack rates are discussed.

AB Two field experiments were performed to examine the impacts on stream invertebrates of crayfish (Paranephrops zealandicus). as predators and bioturbators. A density manipulation experiment involved three treatments with different crayfish densities in streamside channels (0, 5, and 10 crayfish/m(2)) in which accrual of fine sediment, leaf decomposition, and associated invertebrates were measured. During the 50-d experiment, leaf decomposition was not affected by the presence of crayfish, whereas fine sediment was reduced to similar extents in both crayfish treatments. Some invertebrates followed a similar pattern to that of sediment accrual, suggesting that removal of fine sediment by crayfish was a primary mechanism underlying differences in invertebrate densities. Medium (4-6 mm body length) and large (greater than or equal to7 mm) Tanypodinae were rare in crayfish treatments, probably as a result of selective predation. Conversely, crayfish appeared to facilitate Deleatidium mayflies, as predicted by a trophic cascade (large Tanypodinae predator removal) or shredder-collector facilitation (fine particulate organic matter production). In many cases, the response of dependent variables was equally strong at both crayfish densities. In a sediment flush experiment, sediment removal treatments were established, along with no-crayfish control and crayfish treatments, to assess the relative impacts of predation and sediment removal on each invertebrate taxon. Crayfish had little impact on leaf decomposition, although decomposition rate was significantly faster than in sediment flush treatments, where collector-scraper invertebrates were reduced as a result of sediment removal. Despite the, fact that fine sediment was similarly reduced in crayfish and flush treatments, the response of invertebrates to treatments differed according to invertebrate taxon and size class. Overall, large Tanypodinae were selectively preyed upon; Orthocladiinae, Oribatei, and Oligochaeta responded primarily to sediment removal; Deleatidium were indirectly facilitated; and Chironominae, Ostracoda, and Cyclopoida were relatively:unaffected. These results are likely to be relevant at various levels of local scale in the natural environment, but not at the catchment scale. Crayfish are therefore considered to play important roles in determining local distribution of invertebrates through both trophic and nontrophic effects.

AB Plant palatability plays an important part in the fitness of species and is therefore regarded as a key functional trait. The aim of this study was to relate the palatability of aquatic macrophytes to their distribution in riverine wetlands differing in their exposure to spate flood disturbances. Thirty-three former channels of the Rhone River Basin (eastern France) were characterized in terms of flood-disturbance level. Nutrient richness was also measured to eliminate its potential confounding effect. The coverage of 40 macrophyte species was recorded in these wetlands, and their palatability was assessed through laboratory feeding trials using a generalist consumer, the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. The consumption rate of L. stagnalis ranged from 3.9 mg (.) g(-1) (.) d(-1) (for Hottonia palustris) to 137.9 mg (.) g(-1) (.) d(-1) (for Sagittaria sagittifolia) and was used as a palatability index. Plant palatability was unrelated to the nutrient richness of sites but was positively correlated with their flood-disturbance level. However, the strength of this correlation decreased as nutrient richness increased. These results suggest that spate floods promote functional diversity in riverine wetlands, allowing the persistence of the most palatable plant species otherwise eliminated by herbivores, especially in nutrient-poor habitats.

AB Numerous field studies show that changing environmental conditions and ecological interactions within complex food webs can influence the dynamics of populations. Nonetheless, the potential benefit of understanding and predicting this variation to manage harvesting rarely has been considered. Here we develop analytic approximations to explore the relationship between the proportion of variation in annual recruitment that can be predicted and the expected annual harvest yield arising from fixed escapement harvesting methods. Simulations suggest that these approximations are reliable, provided that the unpredicted variance in recruitment is not large and the escapement threshold is set below carrying capacity. As an example of how these approximations may be applied, we use demographic and environmental data from a trapped population of martens (Martes americana) in Ontario to evaluate the effect on harvest yield of improvements in prediction of recruitment based on fluctuations in its prey base. We conclude that realistic improvements in forecasting of recruitment lead to only a modest increase in the average annual harvest and increase the variation in realized harvests, but could substantially reduce the risk of over-harvesting when escapement levels are set low.

AB I describe a diffusion model aimed at the quantitative analysis of movement in heterogeneous landscapes. The model is based on classifying a landscape into a number of habitat types, which are assumed to differ from each other in terms of the movement behavior of the focal species. In addition to habitat-specific diffusion and mortality coefficients, the model accounts for edge-mediated behavior, meaning biased behavior close to boundaries between the habitat types. I illustrate the model with three examples. In the first example, I examine how the strength of edge-mediated behavior and the size of a habitat patch affect the probability that an individual will immigrate to a patch, the probability that an individual will emigrate from a patch, and the time that an individual is expected to spend in a patch. In the second example, I study how a dispersal corridor affects the probability that an individual will move through a landscape. In the third example, I estimate the movement parameters for a species of butterfly from mark-recapture data. In the butterfly examples I classify the landscape into habitat patches, other open areas, and forests. Edge-mediated behavior is found to have a highly significant effect on the general dispersal pattern of the butterfly: the model predicts that the density of butterflies inside habitat patches is >100 times the density of butterflies in adjacent areas.

AB We tested alternative hypotheses concerning factors affecting early forest succession and community composition in deforested and abandoned areas invaded by an exotic grass, Saccharum spontaneum, in Panama. We hypothesized three barriers to natural regeneration: (1) Saccharum competition, (2) seed dispersal limitations, and (3) fire. We measured natural free and shrub regeneration in a factorial experiment combining distances from adjacent forest. mowing treatments of the Saccharum, and a prescribed burn. To determine the applicability of the general model of neotropical succession and the nucleation model Of succession to species composition of forest regeneration in these anthropogenic grasslands in Panama the effect of time since fire and distance to remnant vegetation (isolated trees, shrubs, and large monocots) was measured.
   Fire significantly affected species composition and decreased species richness because most species had either their resprouting ability or seed germination inhibited by fire: the few species that had regeneration enhanced by fire dominated early successional communities. Sites differed in time since fire, ranging from 1 to 4 yr; the interaction of site and distance from the forest significantly affected community composition and the prevalence of species with different dispersal mechanisms and shade tolerance. At recently burned sites. light-dependent wind-dispersed species predominated; most were found near the forest edge. As time since fire increased, significantly more shade-tolerant, larger-animal-dispersed species were recorded, and the proximity to and species identity of remnant vegetation became more important in affecting species composition of the natural regeneration; no significant effect of distance from the forest was found at sites that were unburned for three or more years. Our results support both successional models; the temporal sequence of species composition corresponded to later stages of the general model, while the spatial distribution of species followed the nucleation model. Our results highlight the importance of effective seed dispersal in structuring successional species composition and distribution and in regaining, lost diversity resulting from frequent fires ill the Saccharum.

AB Ecologists increasingly recognize pathogens as playing significant roles in community dynamics, yet few experimental studies have documented patterns of disease impacts oil natural systems. We studied the effects of a pathogenic fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) on community interactions between two sympatric North American anurans: Fowler's toad. Bufo fowleri, and the gray treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis. Recent studies have identified chytridiomycosis as an emerging infections disease, whose widespread occurence poses a significant risk for amphibian populations. We manipulated the presence of B. dendrobatidis in replicated experimental tanks and examined if exposure to this fungus during development could influence recruitment and competitive interactions between larval Bufo and Hyla. Tanks were followed throughout larval development, and we recorded survival. time to metamorphosis. and body mass at metamorphosis. We also tested the effects of competitive and pathogen-mediated stress on developmental stability by measuring fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of surviving metamorphs. B. dendrobatidis had no significant effect on larval survival, but the pathogen reduced metamorphic body mass and increased larval-period length. B. dendrobatidis had different effects oil larval growth depending on the community sructure; in the presence of the pathogen, both Bufo and Hyla metamorphosed at smaller body masses when reared together compared to when reared separately. Bit also had strong negative effects oil Hyla development, but Only in the presence of B. dendrobatidis. FA of hind-limb length was significantly higher for metamorphs front pathogen tanks, but was not associated with density or competitive environment. Our results suggest that chytridiomycosis may impact Bufo and Hyla directly by reducing life-history performance and increasing developmental instability, and indirectly by inducing interspecific competitive effects in mixed-species environments.

AB The view of terrestrial arthropod Communities as potentially exhibiting a mixture of three- and four-trophic-level dynamics creates a new challenge for researchers: the indeterminacy of predator function. Here we evaluate two predictions linking a predator's foraging behavior with its likely ecological role: (1) widely foraging predators may act as effective regulators of sedentary herbivore Populations, and (2) sit-and-wait predators are unlikely to regulate sedentary herbivore Populations but may act as top predators, consuming widely foraging intermediate predators and allowing herbivore Populations to escape from control. We tested these predictions by manipulating the predator community associated with a sedentary herbivore, the spider mite Tetranychus cinnaborinus, feeding on papaya, Carica papayae. The predators included a widely foraging specialist consumer of spider mites, the ladybird beetle Stethorus siphonulus, and a sit-and-wait generalist predator, the tangle-web spider Nesticodes rufipes. The experiments provided support for both predictions. The widely foraging predator Stethorus when tested alone was capable of effective suppression of spider mite populations. In contrast, the sit-and-wait predator, Nesticodes, never suppressed spider mites. Instead, Nesticodes consistently increased the population growth rates of spider mites. This effect was most likely due to Nesticodes suppressing populations of the intermediate predator Stelhorus. Our results underscore the presence of both three- and four-trophic-level dynamics within this arthropod community and begin to address the challenging problem of the indeterminacy of predator function.

AB The damage caused by biological invasions has traditionally been thought to result from alien species taking advantage of ecological differences between the native and introduced ranges. In contrast, the role of evolutionary forces has received relatively little attention. Our results show that evolutionary change in Silene latifolia, a North American weed that was introduced from Europe about 200 years ago, can help explain the plant's Successful North American invasion. By growing plants from seed collected in 40 populations from Europe and North America under common garden greenhouse and field conditions, we found significant genetic differences in life history, reproductive, and defensive characters. In general, morphological traits and competitive ability remained unchanged, while North American plants germinated earlier, grew faster, produced more flowers, had greater survival, and invested less into defensive traits (trichomes, fruit capsule) than their European conspecifics.

AB Activity is an important behavioral trait that in most animals mediates a trade-off between obtaining food for growth and avoiding predation. Active individuals usually experience a higher encounter rate with food items and predators and, as a consequence, grow faster and suffer higher predation pressure than less active individuals. We investigated how predator-induced mortality and growth of the damselfly Coenagrion hastulatum depend on activity at the level of the genotype. Larvae from six different C. hastulatum families were reared in two different predator treatments: predator present or absent. Families differed in activity, and active families grew to a significantly larger size than less-active families. Within families there was a plastic response to predators. Larvae reared without predators were more active and grew larger than larvae reared with a non-lethal predator. In the presence of a lethal predator the active families experienced higher mortality than the less active families. The results illustrate that the growth/predation-risk trade-off was mediated by activity and clearly show a cost of antipredator behavior. They also suggest that variation in activity level might be genetically regulated and Could explain why C. hastulatum are abundant in aquatic systems both with and Without potential predators.

AB Human effects on plant colonization capacity have not been studied mechanistically because a crucial component of colonization capacity, long-distance seed dispersal. could not be quantified. Now, development of mechanistic models has progressed sufficiently to estimate long-distance seed dispersal by wind. We used a recently developed mechanistic dispersal model to quantify seed dispersal by wind in grasslands for three important human effects on natural systems: habitat fragmentation, eutrophication, and an increase in extreme wind velocity events due to climate change. We combined the dispersal data with data on seed production and germination ability to estimate effects on colonization capacity. Habitat fragmentation decreases the number and size of populations. This does not affect the populations' seed dispersal ability, but it reduces the number and germinability of produced seeds, and hence the colonization capacity. Site eutrophication strongly reduces seed dispersal distances, but in some species it also increases seed production and germinability. Thus, long-distance colonization decreases, but short-distance colonization may increase. Wind velocity is the key determinant of dispersal distances. An increase in extreme winds increases long-distance dispersal and long-distance colonization capacity. However, increases in extreme winds predicted for climate change scenarios are not sufficient to compensate the reductions in long-distance colonization due to habitat fragmentation or eutrophication.

AB Although the bulk of plant biomass contains relatively light, atmospherically derived elements (C, H, O, N, and S), 5-10% of biomass is composed of heavier elements from soil minerals, such as Ca, Mg, K, and P. Plant uptake and cycling transport these heavier elements to the soil Surface, resulting in shallower vertical distributions for strongly cycled elements than for other elements. In this paper, we evaluate the biogeochemical consequences of this process at different spatial and temporal scales based on chronosequence studies and soil database analyses. In the bare coastal dunes of Argentina, the vertical distributions of exchangeable K+ (strongly cycled) and Na+ (more weakly cycled) were similar initially but diverged 15 years after pine afforestation, with K distributions becoming significantly concentrated in the surface and Na distributions becoming deeper. To evaluate the effects of plant stoichiometry on micronutrient distributions, chronosequences of paired native grasslands (low Mn cycling) and eucalypt plantations (high Mn cycling) in the pampas of Argentina were also used. Within 50 years, eucalypts dramatically redistributed Mn pools toward the soil surface, reducing total pools by half at medium depths (20-60 cm) and increasing concentrations by up to an order of magnitude at the surface. Globally, we used generalized contrasts among exchangeable K, Na, and Mg in 7661 soil profiles to estimate the global magnitude of K uplift due to plant activity. Based on this calculation, the exchangeable K pool in the top 20 cm of soils without plant uplift would be 4-6 X 10(15) g smaller globally, one-third to one-half smaller than its current size. Vegetation change alters the vertical distribution and bioavailability of mineral elements. Understanding how the stoichiometry of plant cycling affects soil nutrient distributions will help refine predictions of the biogeochemical consequences of current vegetation change.

AB Numerous theories have been developed and tested to explain the high botanical diversity in tropical forests, ranging from nonequilibrium theories emphasizing the importance of chance to equilibrium theories depicting highly specialized species occupying narrow ecological niches. Niche-based theories have most often evaluated species adaptation to different light environments, but some studies have evaluated the importance of edaphic attributes in controlling species distributions. We evaluated the role of edaphic factors in controlling the distribution of African mahogany in the genus Entandrophragma on a 100-ha plot in the Dzanga-Sangha Dense Forest Reserve, Central African Republic. This study went beyond simple characterization of edaphic conditions in topographic or other classes to test for specific associations with chemical and physical soil parameters known to be kimportant to plant growth. Trees greater than or equal to30 cm dbh of the four species of Entandrophragma evaluated were nonrandomly distributed in the forest. Torus translation tests indicated that none of the species exhibited any topographic preferences. However, three of the four species had significant associations with at least two soil chemical attributes. Randomization tests evaluating links between soil chemical and physical properties and topographic position underscored the complexity of the relationship and suggest that inferring edaphic attributes from broadly and simply defined habitat classes may significantly underestimate the importance of soil heterogeneity in contributing to species coexistence.

AB Ecosystem engineering-the physical modification of habitats by organisms-can create patches with altered species richness relative to adjacent, unmodified patches. The effect of ecosystem engineering on patch-scale species richness is likely to be difficult to predict from the identity of the engineer, the resources altered as a result of engineering, or the identities of the affected species. Here we develop a simple conceptual model that predicts the effects of ecosystem engineers on species richness based on how the habitat modifications caused by engineers affect primary productivity, assuming a hump-shaped relationship between productivity and species richness. We review data from 35 studies that contained 60 comparisons of species richness on patches that had been modified by ecosystem engineers vs. unmodified patches. We found no general patterns in whether species richness at the patch scale was increased or decreased by ecosystem engineering. However, 14 of these studies also contained data on primary productivity on and off engineered patches, giving 30 cases to: (1) test whether the effects of ecosystem engineering on richness depend upon the productivity of the ecosystem, and (2) examine the effect of the engineer on productivity. Matching the predictions of the conceptual model, we found a significant negative relationship between productivity and the engineering effect on species richness when ecosystem engineers increased productivity and a weak positive relationship when engineers decreased productivity. We compare the conceptual model developed here to models predicting the effects of grazing and facilitation on species richness. These results, if supported by further studies, can contribute to our general understanding of ecosystem engineering and have important implications regarding the consequences of the loss or introduction of ecosystem engineers on species richness and ecosystem function across landscapes that vary in productivity.

AB The services provided within a community can change as the species composition of that community changes. For example, ant-seed dispersal mutualisms can be disrupted in habitats dominated by invasive ants. We propose that this disruption is related to changes in mean ant body size, given that invasive ants are smaller than most native seed-dispersing ants. We demonstrate that the mean and maximum distances that ants transport seeds adapted for ant dispersal increase with worker body size, and that this relationship is an accelerating power function. This pattern is consistent among three ant subfamilies that include most seed-dispersing ants as well as most invasive ant species, is generalizable across ant species and communities, and is independent of diaspore mass. Using a case study, we demonstrate that both the mean body size of seed-collecting ants and seed dispersal distances are decreased in sites invaded by Solenopsis invicta, the imported red fire ant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mean size of seed-collecting ants at a seed depot or within a community is a useful predictor of mean seed dispersal distances at those sites. Last, we show that small seed-collecting ants and decreased seed dispersal distances are common features of sites occupied by invasive ants. The link between ant body size and seed dispersal distance, combined with the dominance of invaded communities by typically small ants, predicts the disruption of native ant-seed dispersal mutualisms in invaded habitats.

AB Ecological stoichiometry represents an important innovation in ecological modeling, both in its recognition of the causal role of species-specific regulatory physiology in high-level ecological processes and in its adoption of multiple-substance models. In this paper we provide an overview of a geometrical approach for studying the exchange of nutrients between individual organisms and their environment that, although developed independently, shares much in common with ecological stoichiometry and might, we believe, contribute to its further development. In particular, the framework focuses on identifying food components that interact in their effects on organismal nutrition, and quantifying the consequences of these interactions for ingestive regulation,. post-ingestive processing, and animal performance. We illustrate our approach using data,for terrestrial herbivores (insects) and discuss the potential relevance of these data for models of ecological processes.

AB Habitat selection that maximizes both larval settlement success and subsequent juvenile and adult performance is a fundamental challenge for marine benthic organisms with complex life histories (e.g., planktonic larvae). For benthic herbivores, chemical cues from macroalgae can strongly influence both larval settlement/metamorphosis and subsequent performance. We compared the effects of chemical cues from host algae on different life history stages of the "arboreal" sea urchin Holopneustes purpurascens. In sublittoral habitats near Sydney, Australia, H. purpurascens occurred primarily on two algal hosts: red alga (Delisea pulchra) and kelp (Ecklonia radiata). Urchins on E. radiata were significantly larger than those on D. pulchra, but no recruits occurred on E. radiata. In experiments, larvae rapidly metamorphosed in the presence of D. pulchra, but metamorphosis was delayed or nonexistent in the presence of E. radiata. D. pulchra produces a polar chemical inducer of metamorphosis not found in E. radiata. In contrast to larval metamorphosis, feeding and performance of juvenile and adult urchins were considerably worse on D. pulchra than on E. radiata. Feeding experiments confirmed that nonpolar metabolites (halogenated furanones) in D. pulchra deter feeding. Adding natural concentrations of the most abundant furanone to otherwise palatable diets completely inhibited feeding. Urchins fed D. pulchra had reduced survival, growth, and reproduction compared to those fed E. radiata. H. purpurascens did not thrive on the alga on which they preferentially settled; therefore, postrecruitment movement from D. pulchra to E. radiata was crucial to fitness. Urchins in D. pulchra beds moved between plants at night and preferred E. radiata in habitat preference experiments. Movement was constrained by diurnal predators, particularly damselfish Parma microlepis. When H. purpurascens was removed from their algal hosts during the day (but not at night), P. microlepis "clipped" their spines and tube feet. Removal of 10% of an urchin's spines and tube feet was fatal. H. purpurascens recruits onto a host that does not support persistence of the benthic phase and then shifts host plants, incurring a predation risk. Though chemically mediated, ontogenetic shifts in host plant use are known for insect herbivores, this is the first known example in a marine herbivore.

AB In territorial species, the reproductive success of a male is dependent on the quality of his territory. One important component of territory quality is spatial location. High-quality territories not only should be located in areas of high food abundance and low predation, but also should be located in areas that offer optimal amounts of social interaction. Such optima might be different for individuals according to their sex, dominance, or genotype. We studied territory quality (size, vegetation structure, and placement) in a socially monogamous, polymorphic passerine, the White-throated Sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), in order to determine how spatial attributes contribute to selection intensity on two genotypes. In this species, plumage (white and tan), behavior, and life-history characteristics have a genetic basis and are correlated with the presence or absence of a chromosomal inversion. Using remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), we found that the territories of white and tan males do not differ in size or vegetation structure, suggesting that these factors are not of primary importance to males when deciding where to establish a territory. Instead, we suggest that the placement of white and tan territories depends on the number of neighbors (particularly, white male neighbors). Tan males settle in low-density, neighbor-restrictive habitats where intruder pressure from white males seeking extra-pair copulations is reduced. In contrast, white males tend to settle in high-density areas where the probability of encountering neighboring fertile females is greatest. This segregation has led to intraspecific niche partitioning in the two disassortative pair types so that each male morph can best exploit its respective reproductive strategies. These factors may, in turn, contribute to the maintenance of this unusual mating system and, ultimately, the stability of the polymorphism in this species. Similar forces may be operating in other species without distinct morphological markers; we suggest that researchers keep social factors in mind when examining habitat selection.

AB Leaves of Datura wrightii in California (USA) are covered either with glandular trichomes ("sticky" plants) or non-glandular trichomes ("velvety" plants), and sticky plants are resistant to many insect herbivores. Theoretical models suggest that variation in resistance to herbivores may persist if resistance is costly and herbivore damage is variable. If so, then natural selection should favor resistant plants when damage is high and disfavor it when damage is low. However, without long-term equivalence between costs and benefits, then natural selection either should drive the trait to fixation if it has a net benefit or eliminate it if it has a net cost. Previously we showed that the production of glandular trichomes carried a net cost in short-term studies, suggesting that this expensive resistant trait might be eliminated from D. wrightii populations. To test this hypothesis we monitored survival and seed production of sticky and velvety D. wrightii in the presence of herbivores in 11 natural populations over four or five years. In eight populations where both types occurred, the finite rate of increase for velvety plants was 60-274% greater than for sticky plants. Plant survival averaged between two and three years and did not differ significantly between types. Because seed production consistently favored velvety plants, our prediction that the proportion of sticky plants should decline was met within five years in seven of those eight populations. If the variation in trichome morphology in D. wrightii is indeed maintained by variation in costs and benefits of glandular trichomes, then the periodicity of such variation extends over more than five seasons.

AB Ecological theory suggests that community structure determines how ecosystems respond to perturbation. However, this idea is not well-tested empirically, in part because it is difficult to define the appropriate reference state for evaluating post-perturbation dynamics in field experiments. In this study, we (1) evaluated two different methods of determining the reference state, and (2) tested hypotheses derived from theory and previous experiments about the effects of herbivore community structure on autotroph responses to nutrient pulses in freshwater plankton communities. We hypothesized that (1) phytoplankton are less sensitive to a nutrient pulse with increasing zooplankton biomass, size, and Daphnia abundance, and (2) phytoplankton recover more quickly from the nutrient pulse with increased zooplankton biomass and increased abundance of taxa with rapid numerical responses, especially small-bodied cladocerans. We tested these hypotheses in field mesocosm experiments, which crossed four zooplankton community structures with two nutrient pulse treatments in a fully randomized factorial design. We found that phytoplankton sensitivity decreased with increased zooplankton biomass, size, and Daphnia biomass regardless of the method used to define the reference state, supporting our first hypothesis and suggesting that results for sensitivity are robust to methodology. This result, together with previous work, clearly demonstrates that zooplankton have a strong effect on phytoplankton sensitivity. Further, as predicted, return times were shorter with increased zooplankton biomass and biomass of small cladocerans. However, contrary to expectations, return times also declined with Daphnia and copepod biomass, suggesting that the effects of zooplankton on return time are more complex than we hypothesized. Moreover, conclusions for return time depended somewhat on methodology, indicating that we may need to reevaluate whether the concept of return time is relevant for field experiments.

AB In theory, the rate of interpatch dispersal significantly influences the population dynamics of predators and their prey, yet there are relatively few field experiments that provide a strong link between these two processes. In tallgrass prairies of North America, the planthopper, Prokelisia crocea, and its specialist parasitoid, Anagrus columbi, exist among discrete host-plant patches (prairie cordgrass, Spartina pectinata). In many areas, the matrix, or habitat between patches, has become dominated by the invasive exotic grass, smooth brome (Bromus inermis). We performed a landscape-level field study in which replicate cordgrass networks (identical in number, size, quality, and distribution of cordgrass patches) were embedded in a matrix composed of either mudflat (a native matrix habitat) or smooth brome. Mark-recapture experiments with the planthopper and parasitoid revealed that the rate of movement among cordgrass patches for both species was 3-11 times higher in smooth brome than in mudflat. Within three generations, planthopper and parasitoid densities per patch were on average similar to50% lower and spatially 50-87% more variable for patches embedded in a brome as compared to a mudflat matrix. A brome-dominated landscape also promoted extinction rates per patch that were 4-5 times higher than the rates per patch in native mudflat habitat. The effect was more acute for the parasitoid. We suggest that the differences in population dynamics between networks of patches in brome and those in mudflat were driven by underlying differences in interpatch dispersal (i.e., patch connectivity). To our knowledge, this is the first experimental study to reveal that matrix composition, in particular, the presence of an invasive plant species, affects the spatial and temporal dynamics of an herbivore and its natural enemy.

AB The temperate deciduous forest of the northeastern United States is believed to be undergoing a shift from domination by mixed oak (Quercus sp.) to red maple (Acer rubrum); a shift termed "The Red Maple Paradox." This shift in the composition of the forest has the potential to affect ecosystems within the forest that use leaf litter as an energy source. To assess the impact of the red maple paradox on detrital food webs, we conducted a mesocosm experiment investigating the influence of red maple litter on the food web of temporary woodland ponds. Amphibian biomass and survival were significantly lower in experimental ponds that contained only maple litter. The negative effects of maple litter were most pronounced in larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica). We hypothesize that this effect resulted from a temporary shift from a grazing-based food web in oak mesocosms to a microbial-based food web in maple mesocosms, as oak mesocosms initially had higher levels of phytoplankton biomass and lower levels of bacterial production than maple mesocosms. This bottom-up effect of maple litter on wood frogs then appeared to affect other amphibians and zooplankton through a complex series of interactions. These data suggest that litter composition impacted the performance of most trophic groups by altering the processing of energy in this system, thereby destabilizing species interactions throughout the food web. Therefore, "subtle" compositional shifts in the forest have the potential to influence communities that rely upon leaf litter inputs as a primary source of energy.

AB The open population Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) capture-mark-recapture model for estimating survival allows for random temporary emigration from the sampling area, but Markovian temporary emigration can bias estimates of survival. We explore a multistate capture-recapture model that has been proposed for coping with Markovian temporary emigration. We provide a comprehensive assessment of the performance of this model using computer algebra and simulation. We found that most model parameters were identifiable unless survival, emigration, and immigration were all time dependent. Simulation results showed that intrinsically identifiable parameters were estimated without bias and that precision of survival estimates was always high. When temporary emigration was Markovian, precision of estimates of emigration, immigration, and recapture probabilities was acceptable; otherwise it was not. Test component 2.Ct of the goodness-of-fit test for the CJS model had good power to detect Markovian temporary emigration. We conclude that the multistate model works well when temporary emigration is Markovian (i.e., when the CJS model should not be used) and when survival and recapture probabilities are high.

AB Traditionally, herbivorous insects are thought to exhibit enhanced performance and outbreak dynamics on water-stressed host plants due to induced changes in plant physiology. Recent experimental studies, however, provide mixed support for this historical view. To test the plant-stress hypothesis (PSH), we employed two methods (the traditional vote-counting approach and meta-analysis) to assess published studies that investigated insect responses to experimentally induced water-deficit in plants. For insects, we examined how water deficit affects survivorship, fecundity, density, relative growth rate, and oviposition preference. Responses were analyzed by major feeding guild (sap-feeding insects and chewing insects) and for the subguilds of sap-feeders (phloem, mesophyll, and xylem feeders) and chewing insects (free-living chewers, borers, leaf miners, and gall-formers).
   Both vote counting and meta-analysis found strong negative effects of water stress on the performance of sap-feeding insects at large and on members of the phloem- and mesophyll-feeding subguilds in particular. Both analytical techniques demonstrated a nonsignificant response for chewing insects at large due to the offsetting effects of water stress on the different subguilds. For example, our analyses found consistent positive responses for borers, negative responses for gall-formers, and in consistent responses for free-living species and leaf miners.
   Overall, our analyses strongly challenge the historical view that herbivorous insects exhibit. elevated performance and outbreak dynamics on water-stressed plants. Rather, there is widespread evidence that many phytophagous insects, especially sap-feeders, are adversely affected by continuous water stress. Despite enhanced foliar nitrogen during times of plant stress, concurrent reductions in turgor and water content interfere with an herbivore's ability to access or utilize nitrogen. To explain the discrepancy between the observed outbreaks of phytophagous insects on water-stressed plants in nature and the negative effects detected in many experimental studies where plants are continuously stressed, we propose a "pulsed stress hypothesis" whereby bouts of stress and the recovery of turgor allow sap-feeders to benefit from stress-induced increases in plant nitrogen. Our finding that phloem-feeding insects respond positively on intermittently stressed plants but exhibit poor performance on continuously stressed ones is consistent with this hypothesis and suggests that the phenology of water stress as it mediates nitrogen availability may hold the key to understanding how water stress affects the population dynamics of insect herbivores.

AB Epilithic biofilms play a key role in marine ecosystems. They also provide a tractable system to investigate the relative roles of environmental stressors, bottom-up physicochemical factors and top-down biological control in regulating communities. Patterns of photosynthetic microbial biomass were recorded over a four-year period at several tidal levels on shores in the Isle of Man. Photosynthetic biomass and the abundance of diatoms were consistently greater during winter than summer. Biomass Was negatively correlated with insolation stress and air temperature, but was not correlated with grazing intensity, dissolved nutrients, sea temperature, or planktonic chlorophyll. Field experiments confirmed that reducing insolation stress led to substantial increases in photosynthetic biomass, predominantly of diatoms and macroalgal germlings. Reducing grazing intensity also led to considerable increases in photosynthetic biomass, but reducing desiccation stress or increasing nutrient availability had no effect. Although grazing can regulate microalgal biomass, seasonal patterns of grazing activity were driven by temperature and were decoupled from photosynthetic biomass. Our study demonstrates the importance of physiological stresses for the direct and indirect regulation of the balance between primary producers and consumers. Based on these findings, we present a model that combines the roles of stressors together with bottom-up forcing and top-down regulation in controlling communities on wave-exposed shores.

In this study we compare soil concentrations and microbial and plant uptake of amino acids, ammonium (NH4+), and nitrate (NO3-) in acidic and nonacidic tundra. The objective was to determine any differences between the tundra sites that may relate to the differences in vegetation. We sampled the water-extractable soil N pool over one growing season and found that it at all times was higher at the nonacidic than at the acidic site, while at both sites it was dominated by NH4+ followed in order by amino acid N and NO3-. In addition, we designed an experiment in which a mixture of aspartic acid, glycine, NH4+, and NO3- were injected into the soil in the middle of the growth period. In the mixture, one N form at a time was labeled with N-15 and in the case of amino acids also with C-13. Soil and plant samples were collected 4 h following the injection of labeled N. A large portion of the experimental N was recovered in the soil microbial biomass (on average 49% at the acidic site and 40% at the nonacidic site), while less than 1% was recovered in plants. Soil microbes and plants at both acidic and nonacidic tundra were able to take up all isotopically labeled N forms in the presence of added unlabeled N, demonstrating adequate potential to use any N form available. In addition, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of plant roots revealed plant uptake of intact glycine, while isotopically labeled aspartic acid was not recovered inside plants.

AB The intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) has been used for several decades as an explanation for the coexistence of species in ecological communities. It is 14 intuitively simple, but deceptively so. We show, via discussion and examples, that the IDH is not one mechanism of coexistence, but rather summarizes a set of similar phenomena 14 that can arise from the action of several different coexistence mechanisms. These underlying mechanisms are defined by the various ways in which species differ in their response to disturbance-induced spatial and temporal variability in resources and environmental conditions. As an example, the original specification of the IDH required patchy disturbances for coexistence. However, because the underlying mechanisms of coexistence can also operate at the within-patch scale, patchy disturbances are not a necessary requirement for coexistence under intermediate-disturbance regimes. These conclusions are illustrated through,the analysis of three models: a spatial within-patch model, a spatial between-patch model, and a purely temporal model. All three generate similar patterns of coexistence under intermediate disturbance, yet underlying that coexistence lie at least two quite-distinct mechanisms of species coexistence: the storage effect and relative nonlinearity. The results from our analyses suggest that, as a promoter of species coexistence, the IDH is both broader in scope and richer in detail than has previously been recognized.

AB Results from both a spatially explicit stochastic simulation model and a spatially implicit deterministic model show that a weak Allee effect can slow the spread of an invasive plant, Spartina alterniflora, in a Pacific Coast estuary. The mean rate of spread with the Allee effect is similar to19%; removing the Allee effect results ill a mean rate of spread of similar to31%. Sensitivity analysis both with and without the Allee effect reveal that seedling establishment, inflorescence density, and outcrossed seed production are key factors determining invasion rate. When there is ail Allee effect, the invasion rate is sensitive to variation in self-pollinated seed production. By structuring the Population according to density classes instead of the more usual age or stage classes, the deterministic model demonstrates a novel way of representing density dependence and an Allee effect in population biology. This approach could be applied to model the population dynamics of any species that spreads from multiple foci and in which these foci later coalesce.

AB The relatively shorter growing seasons, lower temperatures, and severe winter weather associated with higher latitudes have long been assumed to limit the size of populations, and therefore to constrain the geographical ranges of species. In particular, conspicuous instances of catastrophic mortality during periods of severe winter weather suggest that losses to "winterkill" may often determine latitudinal range limits. However, actual comparisons of overwinter mortality among latitudinally separated populations have been exceedingly rare, and no such study has focused on temperate-zone lizards, one of the groups thought to experience greater overwinter mortality at higher latitudes.
   Here we examine latitudinal variation in overwinter mortality among seven populations of the side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana) alone, a transect spanning nearly 15degrees of latitude in the western United States. We used standard mark-recapture techniques to estimate daily mortality rates for the fall through spring (overwinter) period for three consecutive years. Using these data, we directly test the hypothesis that rates of overwinter mortality increase with increasing latitude.
   Surprisingly, daily mortality rates during the overwinter period appear to be lower-not higher-at higher latitudes. And, in spite of longer winters in the north, even total seasonal losses to winterkill appear, if anything, to be lower at higher latitudes. Mortality rates during the overwinter period were consistently lower than during the activity season, and this pattern was especially pronounced at cold northern sites. These observations indicate that winterkill may not be an important determinant of annual mortality for these populations, and they support the view that predator-mediated mortality during the activity season is the primary source of population loss. Because Uta are inactive during cold winter weather, and because their primary predators are either similarly inactive (e.g., other lizards and snakes) or may have migrated south (e.g., birds), predator-prey encounter rates are lower during higher latitude winters.

AB Population sample data are complex; inference and prediction require proper accommodation of not only the nonlinear interactions that determine the expected future abundance, but also the stochasticity inherent in data and variable (often unobserved) environmental factors. Moreover, censuses may occur sporadically, and observation errors change with sample methods and effort. The state variable (usually density or abundance) may be hidden from view and known only through highly indirect observational schemes (such as public health records, hunting reports, or fossil/archeological surveys). We extend the basic state-space model for time-series analysis to accommodate these dominant sources of variability that influence population data. Using examples, we show how different types of process error and observation error, unequal sample intervals, and missing values can be accounted for within the flexible framework of Bayesian state-space models. We provide algorithms based on Gibbs sampling that can be used to obtain posterior estimates of population states and of model parameters. For models that can be linearized, results can be used for direct sampling of the posterior, including those with missing values and unequal sample intervals. For nonlinear models, we make use of Metropolis-Hastings within the Gibbs sampling framework. Examples derive from long-term census and population data. We illustrate the extension to discrete state variables with multiple stages using a Time-series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (TSIR) model for mid 20th-century measles infection in London, where birth rates are assumed known, but susceptibles and infected individuals arise from imperfect reporting.

AB Edge effects are among the most extensively studied ecological phenomena, yet we lack a general, predictive framework to understand the patterns and variability observed. We present a conceptual model, based on resource distribution, that predicts whether organismal abundances near edges are expected to increase, decrease, or remain unchanged for any species at any edge type. Predictions are based on whether resources are found predominantly in one habitat (decreased abundance in preferred habitat, increase in non-preferred), divided between habitats (predicts an increase near both edges), spread equally among habitats (predicts a neutral edge response), or concentrated along the edge (increase). There are several implications of this model that can explain much of the variability reported in the edge literature. For instance, our model predicts that a species may show positive, negative, and neutral responses, depending on the edge type encountered, which explains some intraspecific variability observed in the literature. In addition, any predictable change in resource use (for example, by region or season) may explain temporal or spatial variability in responses even for the same species at the same edge type. We offer a preliminary test of our model by making predictions for 52 bird species from three published studies of abundance responses near forest edges. Predictions are based solely on general information about each species' habitat associations and resource use. Our model correctly predicted the direction of 25 out of 29 observed edge responses, although it tended to under-predict increases and over-predict decreases. This model is important because it helps make sense of a largely descriptive literature and allows future studies to be carried out under a predictive framework.

AB Metacommunity theories, which consider communities as interacting species assemblages connected by dispersal, differ in their assumptions about the importance of interspecific adaptations and environmental heterogeneity as controls of assemblage composition. I assess the relative importance of regional (dispersal) and local (abiotic and biotic environmental variation) processes in explaining the structure of a freshwater pond metacommunity. Results did not support the hypothesis that dispersal was limited by interpatch distance. Instead, community diversity, composition, and trophic structure were best explained by local environmental variation associated with pond permanence. Many taxa were restricted either to temporary or semipermanent ponds, an outcome that suggests species trade off adaptations to disturbance with those to biotic interactions (species-sorting model) and that refutes the neutral model of interspecific equivalence. However, evidence for high dispersal rates, low-fitness habitats, and high temporal environmental variability indicated that interpatch dispersal also may influence local dynamics through mass effects. These results suggest that integrating the species-sorting and mass-effect niche assembly frameworks will provide a necessary step in the successful application of metacommunity theory.

AB Grasslands and savannas worldwide are experiencing increases in woody plant abundance. In the subtropical Rio Grande Plains of southern Texas and northern Mexico, this change in physiognomy typically results in soil C and N accumulation. The extent to which this accumulation is the result of increased C and N inputs vs. decreased losses is not known. To address this issue, we compared soil C and N pools, soil respiration, soil microbial biomass, and potential C and N mineralization and nitrification rates in remnant grassland communities and adjacent woody plant communities known to have developed on grassland within the past 100 years. Mean soil organic C (SOC) and total N pools in the upper 20 cm of the profile were 2X larger in wooded communities (3382 and 273 g/m(2) for C and N, respectively) than in remnant grasslands (1737 and 150 g/m(2)). The larger pool sizes in the wooded communities supported higher annual soil respiration (SR; 745 vs. 611 g C(.)m(-2.)yr(-1) for woodlands and grasslands, respectively) and greater soil microbial biomass C (444 vs. 311 mg C/kg soil), potential rates of N mineralization (0.9 vs. 0.6 mg N(.)kg(-1.)d(-1)) and nitrification (0.9 vs. 0.4 mg N(.)kg(-1.)d(-1)). However, despite higher SR rates, mean residence time of near-surface SOC in wooded communities (11 years) exceeded that of remnant grassland communities (6 years). The fact that increased fluxes of soil C and N were accompanied by increases in SOC and N pools and total SOC mean residence time suggests that shifts from grass to woody plant dominance have increased both labile and recalcitrant pools of SOC and total N, the latter to a greater extent than the former. Given the widespread increase in woody plant abundance in drylands in recent history, the observed net increase in soil C storage that potentially accompanies this change could have global implications for C and N cycling and the climate system.

AB The ability of females to assess habitat quality for offspring can strongly influence individual reproductive success as well as population dynamics and community assembly. However, the specific relationship between oviposition site selection and larval performance is often unclear. Ovipositing females of several species of treefrogs (Hyla) avoid predatory fish. The fish density required to elicit such avoidance and its relationship to larval performance are central to our understanding of how behavior can drive population dynamics and community assembly in complex landscapes. We conducted experiments investigating both oviposition preference and larval performance in pinewoods treefrogs (Hyla femoralis) along a density gradient of predatory fish (0-6 Umbra pygmaea). Female H. femoralis detected and strongly avoided the nonlethal presence of even a single 2-g fish, ovipositing almost exclusively in predator-free controls. In a separate experiment, larval performance largely matched adult preferences; larvae were totally eliminated in all but the lowest fish density. Given a landscape of breeding sites of varying risks, ovipositing H. femoralis behaviorally partition available habitats into those with and without fish, largely matching the associated fitness consequences.

AB We review an increasingly commonly used experimental approach in avian ecological studies that typifies the difficulties of maximizing two major components of experimental design: internal and external validity. Avian ecologists estimate reproductive success by measuring the rate at which nests in specified treatment groups fledge or fail. Because real bird nests are time-consuming and difficult to find and are rarely dispersed across treatments in sufficient numbers for powerful statistical analyses, investigators often utilize artificial nests, which are human-constructed surrogates baited with eggs and distributed in the field across treatments of interest. The primary advantage of artificial nests is that investigators can control the distribution and numbers of nests. The underlying assumption of similar predation rates on artificial and real nests is almost never tested. In the few studies that directly compare predation of artificial and real nests, however, external validity (or the degree to which results of an experiment can be generalized to subjects other than the experimental sample) is poor: predation of artificial nests differs from that of real nests in unpredictable and inconsistent directions. A primary reason for discrepancies may be that real and artificial nests attract different predators. We conclude that past protocols for use of artificial nests should be abandoned unless investigators carefully demonstrate minimal bias between measures of predation on real and artificial nests.

AB Among air-breathing divers, control of buoyancy through lung volume regulation may be most highly developed in marine turtles. In short, the turtle lung may serve a dual role as both an oxygen store and in buoyancy control. A simple model is developed to show that, for turtles diving up to the maximum depth at which they can still use their lungs to attain neutral buoyancy, the total oxygen store will increase greatly with dive depth, and hence a corresponding increase in dive duration is predicted. Time-depth recorders attached to free-living green turtles (Chelonia mydas) at Ascension Island continued a marked increase in dive duration with depth, with the gradient of this relationship being >10 times that seen in diving birds and mammals. Consistent with the prediction that the lungs serve a dual role, we found that, when lead weights were added to some turtles to increase their specific gravity, the mean depth of dives decreased, but for dives to the same depth, weighted animals dived for longer. The depth distribution of green turtles seems to be generally constrained by the maximum depth at which they can still attain close to neutral buoyancy.

AB A long-term stream fertilization experiment was performed to evaluate the potential eutrophication of an arctic stream ecosystem. During 16 years of summer phosphorus (H3PO4) fertilization, we observed a dramatic change in the community structure of the Kuparuk River on the North Slope of Alaska. A positive response to fertilization was observed at all trophic levels with increases in epilithic algal stocks, some insect densities, and fish growth rates. After approximately eight years of P fertilization, bryophytes (mosses) replaced epilithic diatoms as the dominant primary producers in the Kuparuk River. The moss impacted NH4+ uptake rates, benthic gross primary production, habitat structure, and insect abundance and species composition. This study documents the long-term changes in an arctic tundra stream in response to nutrient enrichment. Predicting stream ecosystem responses to chronic perturbation requires long-term observation and experiments.

AB Ecological genetics is increasingly recognized as critical to understanding interactions among organisms and ecosystem processes. Using a common garden with pure and hybrid cottonwood trees of known genotype, two years of field surveys, and a cafeteria feeding experiment, we link introgression of Fremont genetic markers, condensed tannins (a genetically based plant trait), and foraging by beavers. These data support two major arguments. First, hybridization is an important mechanism for the transmission of ecologically functional traits. Second, links between a genetically based plant trait in a dominant riparian-forest,tree species and the foraging behavior of beavers, an ecosystem engineer, emphasize that genetically based plant traits can directly and indirectly link population, community, and ecosystem processes.

AB Processes controlling the production of new fish (recruitment) are poorly understood and therefore challenge population ecologists and resource managers. Sprat in the Baltic Sea is no exception: recruitment varies widely between years and is virtually independent of the biomass of mature sprat. Sprat is a key prey and predator species in the Baltic ecosystem and is commercially exploited (1.86 X 10(8) kg/yr since 1974). The population and fishery must therefore be managed sustainably and if necessary accommodate environmental effects on population dynamics. We demonstrate using 45 years of data that recruitment depends on temperature conditions during the months when sprat gonads, eggs, and larvae are developing. We also show that recruitment can be predicted before adults spawn (and fully 15 months earlier than using present technology) by using linkages between recruitment, large-scale climate variability (North Atlantic Oscillation), Baltic Sea ice coverage, and water temperature. These relationships increase our understanding of sprat population dynamics and enable a desirable integration of fisheries ecology and management with climatology and oceanography.

AB Based on evidence of negative relationships between forest fragment area and mouse density, earlier studies suggested that forest edge might be high quality habitat for white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus). However, we have found lower densities of this species and higher prevalence of parasitism near woodland edges. To examine the overall effect of edge habitat, we measured food availability (tree seeds and litter invertebrates), reproductive effort, and risk of predation along edge-to-interior gradients in eastern deciduous forests. We also compared woods adjacent to restored prairies to woods adjacent to agricultural fields to determine if the type of habitat adjacent to the edge affected these factors. Results showed slightly higher production of tree seeds in forest interior but no edge-to-interior pattern in abundance of invertebrates. Reproductive effort did not differ between edge and interior either. Risk of predation, however, showed a significant increase with proximity to the woodland edge. Type of adjacent habitat did not consistently affect factors determining. edge-to-interior patterns. Mass of tree seeds differed little between woodland edges adjacent to different habitats in spring but was greater adjacent to agriculture in fall. Invertebrate abundance did not differ between woodland edges with different adjacent habitats. Risk of predation was higher at edges adjacent to restored prairies than at edges adjacent to agricultural fields. We conclude that forest edges are generally lower quality habitat than forest interior for white-footed mice because of increased predation, and that relatively natural edges are likely to have higher risk of predation than anthropogpnic edges.

AB A widespread but controversial idea in ecology states that the number of invaders of a species assemblage depends oil its species richness. Both negative and positive relationships have been reported. We examined whether a simple neutral model where assemblages are generated by drawing individuals from two pools of identical species (native and alien) call predict this relationship. We performed a meta-analysis of published data oil this relationship.
   The neutral model showed that in communities with low and fixed numbers of individuals. the relationship between the number of aliens and native species is strong and negative. This becomes weaker as the proportion of species from both pools already present in the community increases. The relationship between alien and native species richness becomes positive when the number of individuals is allowed to vary, because the richness depends on number of individuals and/or area sampled. The meta-analysis showed that scale-dependence of the relationship between alien and native species richness is universal and compatible with the neutral model. Unless more evidence is available to refute it. the relationship between native and alien species richness should be considered a result of a neutral processes due to constraints on the number of individuals in the community.

AB Canopy nodulation of Acacia koa (koa) is the result of a unique symbiosis between the host adventitious root system and the bradyrhizobia residing in "pockets" within the canopy of koa. These canopy pockets contain trapped organic soils that are mainly derived from decomposing heartwood and phyllode litter of the host tree. These canopy soils have significantly higher levels of exchangeable cations, total nitrogen content, and significantly lower aluminum levels than the terrestrial soils. Canopy Bradyrhizobium isolates from separate koa trees of different locations do not share matching box-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fingerprints, showing that there is no single type that is specific to canopy nodulation. Within the canopy pocket of a single tree, however, we observed a homogenous Bradyrhizobium population that was distinct from the proximal terrestrial population. Canopy nodulation has only been observed on mature koa trees and may function in maintaining symbiosis under stresses occurring within the rhizosphere of the terrestrial environment.

AB Priority effects occur when established residents influence the colonization of individuals entering the community and thus provide insight into mechanisms underlying spatial differences and temporal changes in community composition. Using 20 spatially isolated patch reefs, I factorially manipulated the presence and absence of resident predators (groupers and dottybacks) and potential competitors (damselfishes) to determine whether and how they affect subsequent recruitment and mortality of newly settled fishes. During the 50-day experiment at Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef, western Pacific), prior residency by predators dramatically reduced recruitment of damselfish, surgeonfish, butterflyfish, and rabbitfish and increased damselfish recruit mortality. In contrast, prior residency by potential competitors only reduced recruitment of damselfish and rabbitfish and did not affect recruit mortality. Effects of competitors were likely due to aggressive interactions between competitors and recruits that increased susceptibility of recruits to predators. Effects of residents were strongest within 48 hours of settlement, resulting in rapid establishment of patterns that persisted to the conclusion of the experiment. These results are similar to those from a comparable experiment in the Bahamas (western Atlantic), suggesting that priority effects may be a generally important cause of temporal and spatial variability in the composition of reef fish communities.

AB Beetles in the genus Tetraopes share a long evolutionary history with milkweeds (Asclepias spp.), feeding on roots as larvae and leaves as adults. Despite their extreme specialization on milkweed, Tetraopes require drying grass stems as oviposition sites, even though they do not consume grass. The natural history of the interaction suggests that herbivory may be likely only when milkweeds are in close proximity to grasses. Theory also predicts that two stresses on plants, competition and herbivory, may have non-additive negative impacts on correlates of fitness. In field experiments conducted over two years, I followed the consequences of grass competition and beetle attack for herbivory, growth, and reproduction of milkweed, and reciprocal effects of milkweed on grass in common gardens. To assess the effect of milkweed traits on beetles, I conducted a quantitative genetic experiment using full-sibling families of milkweed and measured the effects of putative resistance traits on the abundance of Tetraopes adults. Milkweeds growing next to grass were initially unaffected in growth but suffered 10% greater leaf herbivory by adult Tetraopes than did milkweeds growing alone. This effect was caused by direct attraction of beetles to grass, not by a competitive modification of milkweed's phenotype. In late summer of the first growing season, when Tetraopes naturally oviposits, I experimentally added larvae to milkweed roots with and without grass competition. Within a month, I detected an interaction between competition and herbivory: neither had an individual impact, but jointly they reduced milkweed growth. In spring of the second growing season, when Tetraopes had completed development, I again found strong evidence for a non-additive effect of competition and herbivory together, severely reducing plant growth compared to their individual effects. Root herbivory induced a plant response that reduced the abundance of leaf-mining flies by 40%, but only for milkweeds with grass competition. Neither competition nor herbivory affected the production of defensive latex, cardenolides, or carbon, but they interacted to affect leaf nitrogen content. Thus, although trait-mediated indirect interactions were implicated in the effect of competition and root herbivory on leaf miner abundance, I did not uncover the mechanism. In the final harvest, beetle herbivory reduced reproductive characters (fruit production, fruit mass, aboveground biomass) by 20-30%, whereas competition had negligible effects. The net interaction effect for grass was competitive, with a 23% reduction in grass biomass caused by milkweed in the absence of herbivory. However, the presence of beetle herbivory on milkweed roots completely alleviated the competitive effect of milkweed on grass. Thus, the associational effect of grass on milkweed resulted in milkweed suffering the non-additive effects of competition and herbivory, whereas grass enjoyed competitive release by facilitating its neighbor's herbivore. Many traits of milkweed (e.g., growth, reproduction, and several resistance traits) showed variation among 23 full-sibling families, indicating that competitive ability and resistance may be subject to natural selection. A multiple regression analysis on family means revealed that leaf trichome density and nitrogen content were negatively genetically correlated with abundance of Tetraopes adults, but probability of flowering and plant height were positively associated. Leaf miners were most strongly negatively affected by latex and trichomes.
   Thus, complex interactions among competition, root herbivory, and plant genetic variation affect the herbivore and plant community and may result in diffuse co-evolution between milkweed and its herbivores. I present a general model that predicts the conditions in which plant-plant interactions result in net competition or facilitation.

AB Tropical rain forests, some of the most diverse natural communities, have been characterized either as inherently stable or as extremely fragile. Theoretically, complex food webs allow for alternative pathways and overlapping functions within and among trophic levels, such that cascading effects are buffered and perturbation is resisted. On the other hand, strong interdependence among species and trophic levels in these same systems can make them vulnerable to perturbation. To assess the ability of a tropical rain forest community to resist perturbation or to amplify perturbation through trophic cascades, we measured changes in overall vegetative cover and species richness of understory plants in response to the experimental addition of a top predator beetle.
   In August 2000, 30 randomly located patches of naturally occurring Piper cenocladum shrubs were found at sites with variable soil quality and light availability, and top predator addition treatments were randomly assigned to half the patches. Using an 8-m(2) subplot within each P. cenocladum patch, we estimated (nondestructively) vegetative cover of understory plants for nine months and measured herbivore damage, plant longevity and plant species richness for similar to1.5 years.
   For all understory species in our subplots, vegetative cover and total numbers of leaves declined significantly more in predator addition patches than in control patches. Understory cover also declined significantly more on poor soils than on rich soils. Mortality of small plants was high overall, but longevity was significantly greater in control patches than in patches with top predators. Herbivore damage was lowest, plant establishment highest, and the accumulation of new plant species highest in control plots on rich soils. The cumulative effect of top predators interacted with plant resources, such that plant species richness was suppressed when beetles were present in understory communities on rich soils. Patterns of herbivore damage suggest that trophic cascades from apex predators through ant predators to herbivores altered the structure of understory vegetation. The presence of indirect effects supports the characterization of rain forests as vulnerable ecosystems whose integrity may be threatened by the slow erosion of complex tight interactions among species.

AB While epidemiological models have suggested that the spread of parasites and infectious diseases often depends critically on the extent of movement by infected individuals between populations, there is little empirical information for any organism on the frequency of between-group parasite transmission or how it varies spatially. The transmission of parasites between discrete social groups or populations may also help determine a host's total parasite or pathogen exposure. We measured the introduction of parasitic bugs (Oeciacus vicarius) into colonies of Cliff Swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) by transient birds from outside each group. The transmission of bugs increased strongly as the size of a nesting colony increased. More total transients visited the larger colonies, and the direction of change in transient numbers and the numbers of bugs introduced at a site from week to week tended to vary together. Transients at large colonies were more likely to have previously or subsequently visited other large, infested colonies. The greater likelihood of parasites being introduced into larger colonies by transient birds contributes to an increase in parasite load with increased colony size in Cliff Swallows.

AB Do reproducing female reptiles adaptively manipulate phenotypic traits of their offspring by selecting appropriate nest sites? Evidence to support this hypothesis is indirect, mostly involving the distinctive characteristics of used (vs. available) nest sites, and the fact that physical conditions during egg incubation can modify hatchling phenotypic traits that plausibly might influence fitness. Such data fall well short of demonstrating that nesting females actively select from among potential sites based on cues that predict fitness-determining phenotypic modifications of their offspring. We provide such data from experimental studies on a small oviparous snake (the keelback, Tropidonophis mairii) from the wet-dry tropics of Australia. When presented with a choice of alternative nesting sites, egg-laying females selected more moist substrates for egg deposition. Incubation on wetter substrates significantly increased body size at hatching, a trait under strong positive selection in this population (based on mark-recapture studies of free-ranging hatchlings). Remarkably, the hydric conditions experienced by an egg in the first few hours after it was laid substantially affected phenotypic traits (notably, muscular strength) of the hatchling that emerged from that egg 10 weeks later. Thus, our data provide empirical support for the hypothesis that nesting female reptiles manipulate the phenotypic traits of their offspring through nest-site selection, in ways that enhance offspring fitness.

AB Flowering plants often exhibit declining investment in gametes, seeds, and floral organs among sequentially blooming flowers within inflorescences. However, few experimental studies have determined the relative importance of proximate underlying causes such as architectural constraints or resource competition among flowers, and fewer still have identified likely selective factors that favor sequential variation in allocation. By combining observational and experimental studies in natural populations of Aquilegia canadensis, we showed that ovule and pollen production declined with flower sequence by 9% and. 18%, respectively, due to architectural effects. However, a much stronger decline in fruit set (27%) and seeds per fruit (58%) was mediated entirely by competition for resources among flowers. Reducing resources by defoliation greatly reduced fruit set (-37%) and seeds per fruit (-61%) and increased the severity of the decline in fruit set. Experimentally alleviating resource preemption by first flowers greatly increased the seed production of later flowers (+39%) to the extent that fourth flowers on manipulated plants set as many seeds as first flowers on control plants. In contrast, aspects of floral morphology including sepal size, nectar spur length, and herkogamy showed little or no sequential variation and were relatively insensitive to experimental manipulation of resources. We also investigated whether the positional decline in allocation was adaptive. Disproportionate investment in early flowers was not associated with a seasonal decline in important environmental factors (e.g., light, water, soil nutrients) or cross-pollination. Marker-gene assays also failed to show that early flowers consistently produced a greater proportion of high-quality outcrossed progeny. All flowers had a high probability of being eaten by herbivores (mean = 70%). However, the risk of herbivory was lower for early flowers (64%) than later flowers (79%). Herbivory may, therefore, select for higher allocation to early flowers as well as flexible investment mediated by interflower competition because it allows the reallocation of resources to later flowers when early flowers are lost to herbivores. This adaptive hypothesis is further supported by comparative data from closely related A. caerulea, which differs from A. canadensis in the nature of herbivory as well as the pattern and mechanism of sequential variation in reproductive allocation.

AB We tested the biological cause of density-dependent mortality in the bridled goby (Coryphopterus glaucofraenum), a small coral reef fish, and evaluated whether this knowledge allowed us to detect density dependence at different spatial scales in natural habitats. To identify the biological cause of density dependence, we manipulated both population density and the availability of shelter (crevices used as refuges from predators) in small plots of continuous reef. We detected strong density-dependent mortality in plots with few refuges, but mortality was density independent in plots with abundant refuges, indicating that limited shelter causes density dependence. Predator density was unrelated to the density of gobies and refuges, suggesting that predators displayed a type III functional response in patches with few refuges. In a second experiment, we manipulated goby density within replicate plots of three sizes (4, 16, and 64 m(2)) that varied naturally in the availability of refuges. If refuge availability was ignored, mortality appeared to be density independent at all scales. If, however, plots were grouped by refuge availability, mortality was density dependent in plots with few refuges, but low and density independent in plots with many refuges at all spatial scales. Understanding the mechanism of density dependence (refuge shortage) was thus required to measure the strength of density dependence in natural, spatially variable, habitat. We suggest that density dependence was detectable in plots of different sizes because the relationships between the densities of gobies, refuges, and goby predators were similar across the spatial scales we studied. Our work demonstrates that identifying the biological interactions that cause density dependence, and characterizing the spatial domains at which those interactions operate, will be important to accurately assess the effects of density dependence on population dynamics.

AB A change in population density can generate spatial and demographic effects that can have an impact on fluctuations in population Size for many years. Although the demographic effects of time lags have been incorporated into analyses of time series data, there are few detailed descriptions of the long-term demographic consequences of a change in density. We use detailed, individual-based data from a population of red deer (Cervus elaphus) from the North Block of the Isle of Rum, Scotland, to describe long-term demographic and spatial effects of a change in density. The population was released from hunting pressure in 1972. Over the following 10 years population density doubled and, since the early 1980s, has fluctuated around ecological carrying capacity. The cessation of culling led to long-term transient spatial and demographic effects that have persisted for 30 years. Different vital rates responded to the increase in density at different rates, causing long-term changes to the demographic and spatial structure of the population. These changes altered the impact of different age- and sex-specific vital rates on annual changes in population size. These changes are still ongoing, 30 years after cessation of the cull, suggesting that a change in density may generate transient dynamics that persist for several generations.

AB In this paper, we examine how per capita emigration rates vary with patch size. Analyses of analytic diffusion models and lattice simulations show that the scale dependence of emigration rates is expected to differ between small and large patches. In large patches, per-capita emigration rate (E) is given by E = kA(-beta). A is the area, k is a constant, and beta, which describes the strength of the scale dependence, is given by beta = 1-d/2, where d is the fractal dimension of the patch boundary. In small patches, the scale dependence is predicted to level off, and the value of the scaling coefficient (beta) is influenced by details about how movement behaviors and mortality rates vary across patch boundaries. However, much of this variation can be explained as effects on the magnitude of per capita emigration rates.
   Analyses of published empirical studies of the scale dependence of emigration in terrestrial insects show that observed scaling coefficients are within the expected range (0 < beta < 0.5), and that scaling coefficients decrease with decreasing scale. Moreover, we find that the fractal dimension of patch boundaries and the magnitude of emigration explain much of the observed variation between different patch networks, species, years, and sexes.

AB Despite increasing evidence of seed limitation in forest ecosystems, data remain sparse on Spatial patterns of seed rain at large (>1 ha) spatial scales. We monitored seed rain (28.5 m(2)) throughout five northern hardwood forest fragments (27 ha sampled across 14-km(2) area) in southeastern Michigan over two years. Four fragments were nearest neighbors (300-700 m), yet varied in species composition, providing,the opportunity to detect landscape-scale seed exchange. Of the 37 species of woody plants present in the seed rain (98 032 mature seeds), only three (Betula papyrifera, Ostrya virginiana, and Ulmus americana) had widespread seed dispersions within all fragments containing resident sources (seed in >70% of traps in each fragment). Seed dispersions, measured as the percentage of traps within a fragment receiving seed, differed among species using different dispersal vectors with animal-dispersed species arriving in a lower percentage of seed traps than wind-dispersed seeds. At a given source density, seed dispersions increased with decreasing seed mass. Light-seeded, fecund species such as Betula or Tsuga required lower source densities to saturate fragments with seed compared to heavy-seeded species (Acer, Fraxinus, Tilia). Heavy-seeded wind- and animal - dispersed species also displayed the strongest evidence of seed limitation, with seedling presence significantly associated with presence of seed for Carpinus caroliniana, Fagus grandifolia, Prunus avium, and Tilia americana. Of 17 species, landscape-scale seed exchange was detected for only four disturbance-associated species (Acer negundo, Betula papyrifera, Celastrus scandens, Eleaganus umbellata). No exchange was detected for Acer rubrum, Betula alleghaniensis, or Tsuga canadensis, despite broad seed dispersions (>50%) in fragments with resident sources, suggesting the potential for seed limitation for these species at larger spatial scales. Seed encounter probabilities suggest that potential seed competitors often fail to simultaneously colonize microsites. We suggest that all dominant species in northern hardwood forests can be seed limited at some spatial scale and that results are consistent with "winning by forfeit" scenarios of diversity maintenance in forest ecosystems.

AB In this paper, we present a statistical method called STATICO that can be used to analyze series of pairs of ecological tables. The objective of this method is to find the stable part in the dynamics of the relationships between the species and their environment. The treateddata are a sequence of pairs of ecological tables. Each pair is made of a species abundance table (species in columns) and an environmental variables table (variables in columns). The sampling sites (in rows) must be the same for the two tables of one pair, but they may be different among the pairs. The environmental variables must be the same in all the environmental tables, and the list of species must be the same in all the species tables too, although some species may be absent from some tables (the corresponding columns will contain all zeros). From a statistical point of view, STATICO is a multitable analysis (partial triadic analysis) performed on the series of cross-tables resulting from the co-inertia analysis of each pair of tables. A small ecological example data set is analyzed and the results are discussed to show how this method can be used to extract the stable part of species-environment relationships. All computations and graphical displays can be performed with free software available on Internet.

AB Although species diversity is often correlated with ecosystem size ill a consistent manner, mechanistic explanations of when and why diversity is related to size remain elusive. Rarely considered ill understanding size-diversity relationships is the history of community assembly. I conducted a laboratory microcosm experiment with freshwater protists and rotifers to test for interactive effects of assembly history and ecosystem size oil species diversity. The experiment used a two-way factorial design with four assembly sequences and four ecosystem sizes as treatments. Community dynamics were monitored for about 50-100 generations. The results show that history affected diversity more strongly in smaller ecosystems, presumably owing to greater priority effects. Consequently. history determined when diversity was significantly related to ecosystem size. The results also suggest that long-term transient community dynamics can make assembly history important for community structuring even in the absence of alternative stable states. Because species immigration is essentially stochastic, ecosystem size is variable. and priority effects can be strong in many natural systems, the history X size interaction revealed in this Study also has the potential to shape natural size-diversity patterns.

Furthermore, we provide the first empirical evidence for a deceleration of the coevolutionary arms race caused by the inclusion of a second host species into a parasite-host association. We compare two communities, each including the North American slavemaking ant Protomognathus americanus and two Leptothorax host species, with similar parasite and host densities. At the first site, the minority host species occurred at frequencies too low to sustain the parasite, whereas at the second location, both hosts constituted an exploitable resource. Thus, only in the latter community does the parasite have the options to expand its niche or to alternate between the available host species. During slave raids, which represent the crucial parasite-host encounter, hosts and slavemakers from the second site were less efficient at defending and raiding, respectively. Thus, we demonstrate a higher degree of reciprocal adaptation at the location where the parasite specializes on a single host, indicating a more advanced stage of the arms race.

AB It is commonly thought that diverse agroecosystems are less prone to pest outbreaks because they support a high diversity of natural enemies. The idea that diversity stabilizes functional properties of communities to environmental perturbation is formalized in the ecological literature as the "insurance hypothesis." Recently this hypothesis has been examined theoretically and in microcosm experiments. However it has not been tested empirically in an agroecosystem. Here we provide a test of the insurance hypothesis by examining insect predation by birds in coffee farms with different levels of plant diversity. Lepidopteran larvae were placed in coffee plants, and larval disappearance rates were measured within and outside bird exclosures in two farms with distinct levels of shade. Significant differences were found associated with the exclosure treatment, indicating that birds can potentially prevent pest outbreaks. Furthermore, the effect was significant only for the, farm with a high floristic diversity, providing partial evidence in support of the insurance hypothesis.

AB Biodiversity is declining worldwide from reductions in both species richness and evenness. Field experiments have shown that primary productivity is often reduced when richness of plant species is lowered. However, experiments testing richness effects have used evenness levels that are much higher than normally encountered in plant communities and have been based on the assumption that species extinctions are random. We experimentally varied, for the first time, both species richness (1-8 perennial species/m(2)) and species evenness (near maximal vs. realistically low) in grassland plots. Net primary productivity (NPP) and ecosystem CO2 uptake declined when richness was reduced, and reductions were similar between evenness treatments. Richness effects were associated more with a selection effect than with complementarity (found only with high evenness). Importantly, extinctions in plots during the second year were not random, but were greater at low than at high evenness (i.e., with increased rarity) and in species with low above-ground growth rates. Thus, species evenness can affect grassland ecosystem processes indirectly by affecting species richness, and it will be imperative to understand. how nonrandom extinctions affect NPP in future studies. Our results indicate that richness studies may not be biased by using mixtures with artificially high evenness levels, but the results also demonstrate that results from these studies are directly applicable only to communities in which plant extinctions are random.

AB Pathogens and herbivores can severely reduce host fitness, potentially leading to altered succession rates and changes in plant community composition. Thus, to predict vegetation dynamics under climate change, it is necessary to understand how plant pathogens and herbivores will respond. Pathogens and herbivores are predicted to increase under climate warming because the amount of time available for growth and reproduction will increase. To test this prediction, we used a warming experiment in which heaters were suspended over a natural montane meadow for 12 years. In the summer of 2002, we quantified damage by all the observable (aboveground) pathogens and herbivores on six of the most common plant species (Artemisia tridentata, Helianthella quinquenervis, Erigeron speciosus, Potentilla gracilis, Potentilla hippiana, and Lathyrus leucanthus). We found that plants in the earlier melting plots generally had the most damage and were attacked by a larger number of species, which is consistent with predictions. However, although the overall trend was an increase in damage with warmer temperatures and earlier snowmelt, some pathogens and herbivores performed better in cooler or later melting plots. The idiosyncratic response of each species to environmental conditions suggests that there are likely to be changes in community composition as the planet warms.

AB The ecological mechanisms hypothesized to structure species-rich communities range from strict local determinism to neutral ecological drift. We assessed the degree of ecological determinism in tropical plant community structure by analyses of published demographic data; a broad range of spatial, historical, and environmental variables; and the distributions of 33 herbaceous species (plot size = 0.02 ha) and 61 woody species (plot size = 0.09 ha) among 350 plots in a 16-km(2) forest landscape (Barro Colorado Island, Panama). We found a strong degree of cross-landscape dominance by a subset of species whose identities were predictable from sapling survivorship rates under shade. Using canonical ordination we found that spatial and environmental-historical factors were of comparable importance for controlling within-landscape variability in species composition. Past land use had a strong impact on species composition despite ceasing 100-200 years ago. Furthermore, edaphic-hydrological factors, treefall gaps, and an edge effect all had unique impacts on species composition. Hence, ecological determinism was evident in terms of both cross-landscape dominance and within-landscape variability in species composition. However, at the latter scale, the large portion of the explained variance in species composition among plots uniquely attributed to spatial location pointed to an equally important role for neutral processes.

AB The largest uncertainty in forecasting the effects of climate change on ecosystems is in understanding how it will affect the nature of interactions among species. Climate change may have unexpected consequences because different species show unique responses to changes in environmental temperatures. Here we show that increasingly warmer springs since 1962 have disrupted the trophic linkages between phytoplankton and zoo-plankton in a large temperate lake because of differing sensitivity to vernal warming. The timing of thermal stratification and the spring diatom bloom have advanced by more than 20 days during this time period. A long-term decline in Daphnia populations, the keystone herbivore, is associated with an expanding temporal mismatch with the spring diatom bloom and may have severe consequences for resource flow to upper trophic levels.

AB Many plant populations reproduce synchronously over time. Hypotheses to explain reproductive synchrony have typically been based on evolutionary advantages of synchrony, such as increased pollination or decreased predation with increasing numbers of flowering plants, often referred to as economies of scale. We tested for decreased herbivory, increased fruit set, and decreased predation as evolutionary mechanisms driving synchronous reproduction in an iteroparous perennial plant, Astragalus scaphoides, at three semiarid sagebrush steppe sites in intermountain valleys of Idaho and Montana, USA. Reproduction was synchronous at all sites and significantly bimodal at two sites, but it was never as variable as distinctly mast-seeding plant species. Plants in all populations experienced at least one economy of scale: decreased inflorescence herbivory, increased fruit set, and/or decreased weevil seed predation with increasing flowering plant density. At two of three sites, these relationships were strong enough to increase expected geometric mean seed set. However, among-site differences in benefits and strength of synchrony were not concordant. In particular, the site with the strongest economy of scale and highest coefficient of variation (cv) was the least bimodal. We suggest that different mechanisms drive. cv and bimodality in this species, both of which contribute to overall synchrony. In addition to reflecting direct fitness benefits, synchrony may be at least partly an indirect consequence of individual-level reproductive constraints. Recent models have demonstrated that individual-level constraints can make bimodal, alternate-year flowering likely.

AB Trees of the genus Acacia are widespread and important components of savanna ecosystems. Factors or organisms that influence the survival of Acacia seedlings are likely to affect tree recruitment and therefore community and ecosystem dynamics. In African savannas, large mammals, especially elephants, have been considered the most important agents of mortality for adult trees, but their impacts on tree seedlings are not well known. We investigated the effects of large mammals on Acacia seedling survival by excluding large mammals from replicated 4-ha plots. Approximately twice as many seedlings were killed in plots with large mammals absent as on plots with large mammals present. Rodents and some invertebrates were more abundant on plots without large mammals and were responsible for these higher predation rates. Seedlings in areas with large mammals were more likely to die of desiccation; however, net seedling survival was approximately twice as high in the presence of large mammals. Our results indicate that large mammals may indirectly increase Acacia seedling survival and thus accelerate, rather than inhibit, tree recruitment.

AB In contrast to competing explanations of species-area relationships (SARs), neutral theory is dynamic, meaning that it should explain patterns in both space and time. However, most empirical tests of neutral theory have. relied on snapshots, such as comparisons of observed and simulated SARs observed at one point in time. I used 35 years of data from permanent plots in Kansas grasslands to test the ability of strict and modified neutral models to reproduce observed species-area and species-time relationships (STRs). Holding species density to observed values, the models could generate realistic SARs or STRs, but not both simultaneously. Parameter combinations that simulated realistic STRs led to SARs with extremely steep slopes. To examine the consequences of relaxing neutrality, I incorporated plant functional types into the model. More realistic dominance produced only limited improvement in the simulated results, and indicates that the models' primary flaw is their failure to reproduce rapid but spatially correlated changes in species composition. In these grasslands, characterized by large interannual variation in resources and many short-lived species, functional differences among species play a strong role in driving macroscopic patterns. The results emphasize the need to test neutral models, and other dynamic community models, with spatiotemporal data.

AB Overall mortality rates often are based upon a variety of mortality sources such as predation, disease, and accidents, and each of these sources may influence population dynamics differently. To better understand population dynamics or to derive effective conservation plans, it is thus crucial to know the frequency of specific mortality causes as well as their variation over time. However, although the mortality cause of retrieved marked animals is often known, this information cannot be used directly to estimate the frequency of a mortality cause. By calculating the ratio of the number of animals reported dead from a specific cause to the total number of retrieved animals, one does not consider the fact that the probability of finding a dead individual depends on the cause of its death. Although frequently used, such ad hoc estimates can be heavily biased. Here we present a new way of estimating the frequency of a mortality cause from ring-recovery (band-recovery) data without bias. We consider the states "alive," "dead because of mortality cause A," and "dead due to all other causes" and estimate within a multistate capture-recapture framework the transition probabilities as well as the state-specific resighting probabilities. Among the transition probabilities are the overall survival probability and the proportion of animals dying because of A. From these, the probability that an animal dies during a year due to the specific cause of interest (cause A kill rate) can easily be calculated. We illustrate this model using data from White Storks Ciconia ciconia ringed in Switzerland to estimate the proportion of storks that died due to power line collision. Average unbiased estimates of this proportion were 0.37 +/- 0.08 (mean +/- 1 SE) for juveniles, about 25% lower than ad hoc estimates, and 0.35 +/- 0.09 for adults. The annual survival rate of juveniles was 0.33 +/- 0.05 and of adults, 0.83 +/- 0.02. Power line mortality is thus important for White Storks, with about one in four juveniles and one in 17 adults dying each year because of power line collision. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of the new model and how the results could be used to explore the link between a specific mortality cause and population dynamics.

AB Time series of population abundance estimates often are the only data available for evaluating the prospects for persistence of a species of concern. With such data, it is possible to perform a population viability analysis (PVA) with diffusion approximation methods using estimates of the mean population trend and the variance of the trend, the so-called process variation. Sampling error in the data, however, may bias estimators of process variation derived by simple methods. We develop a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based method for estimating trend, process variation, and sampling error from a single time series based on a discrete-time model of density-independent growth coupled with a model of the sampling process. Transformation of the data yields a conventional linear mixed model, in which the variance components are functions of the process variation and sampling error. Simulation results show essentially unbiased estimators of trend, process variation, and sampling error over a range of process variation/sampling error combinations. Example data analyses are provided for the Whooping Crane (Grus americana), grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), California Condor (Gymnogyps californianus), and Puerto Rican Parrot (Amazona vittata). This REML-based method is useful for PVA methods that depend on accurate estimation of process variation from time-series data.

AB Coexistence of resource specialists can be maintained through various spatial mechanisms, each potentially inducing different resource dynamics. We used observational data to suggest plausible spatial coexistence mechanisms for Aphytis melinus and Encarsia perniciosi, two parasitoids of California red scale. Aphytis consistently produced more progeny from scale insects on leaves, and Encarsia produced progeny equally from scale insects on leaves and stems. To investigate the mechanism inducing this pattern, we performed field experiments to test two possible explanations. In the absence of substrate choice and at a given abundance of scale, the number of progeny produced by each species was the same on stems as on leaves. When given a choice, Encarsia had no substrate preference, while Aphytis preferred scale insects on leaves, producing results qualitatively similar to the field observations. Ecological theory suggests that this form of habitat preference may facilitate coexistence. Although this mechanism of coexistence is clearly compatible with biological control by multiple natural enemies in the red scale-system, theory dealing with this type of interaction has not thoroughly examined the predictions for resource dynamics.

AB Elasticities of matrix elements from population projection matrices are commonly used to analyze the relative contributions of different life history transitions (birth, survival, growth) to the finite rate of increase (lambda). Hitherto, comparative demography based on matrix models has relied upon decomposing elasticity matrices into blocks, each containing matrix elements deemed to represent recruitment, stasis, or progression to larger size classes. Elasticities across an entire matrix always sum to unity, and different populations and species can be compared on the basis of the relative proportions of these three variables. This method has been widely used, but it contains a weakness in that the value of matrix elements is a function of more than one vital rate. For example, transitions representing progression to larger size classes involve a survival rate as well as a growth rate. Ideally, then, demographic comparisons between populations should be made using elasticities of vital rates themselves, rather than elasticities of matrix elements that are compounds of those rates. Here, we employ the complete set of general equations for the elasticity of vital rates in an entirely new analysis of matrices for 102 species of perennial plants. The results show a surprising similarity to an earlier analysis based upon matrix element elasticity and provide important confirmation of general patterns of correlation between plant life history and demography. In addition, we show that individual vital rate elasticities cannot, on their own, predict variation in life history. Therefore, all three demographic processes (survival, growth, and reproduction) are necessary to account for life history variation. The new analysis provides a firmer foundation for comparative demography.

AB The food value theory of territoriality predicts an inverse relationship between territory size and food density. However, several non-mutually exclusive hypotheses can explain this relationship. We studied the relationship between foliage density, food density, competitor density, and territory size of the Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus), a canopy-dwelling, insectivorous songbird, in the Monongahela National Forest, West Virginia, USA, 1995-1998. First, we established the relationship between territory size and the canopy-tree foliage density. We then utilized the relationship between foliage density and foliage arthropod density (in particular, Lepidoptera larvae) to evaluate whether an inverse correlation between food density and territory size existed and to examine the proximate cues that Red-eyed Vireos used to adjust territory size. Foliage density in a habitat patch was used by Red-eyed Vireos as a proximate cue to set the size of a three-dimensional territory volume that ultimately corresponded to the "average" caterpillar density on those trees during the nestling stage. Territory volumes were smaller where foliage density was greater. Two measures of competitor density were not inversely correlated with territory size. These results support the structural-cues hypothesis for a species that forages in the structurally complex foliage of deciduous forests, and they are consistent with the food-value theory of territoriality. Caterpillar density varied widely over the course of the breeding season, among locations and among tree species, reaching a low during the nestling stage of the breeding cycle. Yet, the total territory volume utilized by Redeyed Vireos was inversely related to the density of caterpillars during this stage (i.e., when they would be needed as a food source to provision young), consistent with the food-value theory. Food availability at the time of territory selection was not a reliable cue for future food resources because of spatial and temporal variability in caterpillar density. Instead, a stable structural cue, foliage density, was highly predictive of caterpillar density during the nestling stage of an average, or typical, year. This study suggests that Red-eyed Vireos can reliably secure food resources for nestlings at the time of territory establishment, using foliage density as a cue.

AB Multilevel natural selection has been demonstrated in natural plant populations, but the ecological conditions that influence the strength of different levels of selection are poorly known empirically. One of the factors most likely to influence the relative strength of individual and group selection is density. If density determines the intensity of interactions among neighbors, one expects that individual selection may be strong at low density but that group selection would be strongest at high density. This study characterized how density influences multilevel selection on size in the Great Lakes sea rocket (Cakile edentula). Plants were grown at three different densities in the field, and multilevel natural selection on plant size was estimated. As predicted, only individual selection was detected at the lowest density, but group selection was detected at higher densities. Surprisingly, group selection was strongest not at the highest density, but at intermediate density, where it opposed individual selection; shorter, heavier individuals growing in groups of tall, light plants had the highest fitness. At the highest density, the effect of neighbor phenotype on reproduction differed between central and peripheral group members, leading to no overall group selection detected at high density. The observation that group selection was more prevalent at higher density than at the lowest density supports the general prediction that more intense interactions among group members can lead to stronger group selection. However, the strength and direction of group selection changed unpredictably with increasing density and spatial placement. This result emphasizes the need for spatially explicit investigations of how interactions among individuals influence patterns of multilevel selection in plant populations.

AB One goal of phytohormonal ecology is to study the interactions between biotic and abiotic stress at hierarchical levels of biological organization. From an ecological perspective, exposure to one stress may alter the Plant's probability of being exposed to another stress. From a mechanistic perspective, hormonal and biochemical signaling interactions between responses to each stress may influence the severity or ability to adaptively respond to the subsequent stress. In this article, we consider the relationship between plant water and salt stress and attack by pathogens and herbivores. Empirical data suggest that water stress and the probability of attack by pathogens and herbivores are correlated between habitats. Biochemical interactions between plant responses to water and salt stress and insect. and pathogen attack are also interrelated. Initial biochemical models indicated that abscisic acid (ABA), an important hormone in responses to water and salt stress, had a synergistic positive role with jasmonate-induced defenses against herbivores and an,antagonistic role with salicylate-based resistance to some pathogens. Based on this background, we developed predictions about how water and salt stress would alter plant resistance to insects and pathogens and tested the predictions using tomato plants as a model system. We: used polyphenol oxidase activity as a marker of the jasmonate response and, pathogenesis-related protein P4 as a marker of the salicylate response. First, we examined levels of chemical defense in wild-type and ABA-deficient plants and the ability of these plants to resist insect and pathogen attack. In the second experiment, we exposed plants to short-term salinity stress and tested their subsequent resistance to a chewing. insect Spodoptera exigua and the bacterial speck pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. We have two key findings. First, ABA-deficient plants had higher levels of salicylate-mediated responses and were more resistant to bacterial speck disease, consistent with the proposed role of salicylate in defense against pathogens. This suggests linkage between water availability to the plant and salicylate action in pathogenesis through ABA signaling. ABA-deficient plants had reduced resistance to the insect Spodoptera exigua, suggesting a positive correlation between responses to water stress and herbivory. The lack of difference in chemical expression of the jasmonate (JA) response (polyphenol oxidase activity) between wild-type and ABA-deficient plants did not support the proposed mechanism of synergism with the jasmonate response. Second, salt stress reduced the chemical induction, (e.g., pathogenesis-related protein P4) of the salicylate response, but this did not affect resistance to the pathogen. Salt stress did not alter resistance to the herbivore Trichoplusia ni, but did alter the negative signal interaction between the jasmonate and salicylate responses. Under control conditions, the jasmonate and salicylate responses are antagonistic to one another, with induction of one response reducing the inducibility of the other. Under salt stress conditions, the negative effect of salicylate on the jasmonate response was reduced. Thus, complex interactions occur between. ABA, JA, and SA, hormones that are important regulators of abiotic and biotic stress responses. Phytohormonal ecology is attempting to link ecological and hormonal interactions to develop a predictive framework for how and Why plants coordinate responses to the environment.

AB Desert ecosystems are characterized by distinct spatial patterning in soil biogeochemistry and biodiversity. In the Antarctic Dry Valleys, soil polygons are prominent features of the landscape and may be key units for scaling local ecological information to the greater region. We examined polygon soils in each of the three basins of Taylor Valley, Antarctica. Our objectives were to characterize variability in soil biogeochemistry and biodiversity at local to regional scales, and to test the influence of soil properties upon invertebrate communities. We found that soil biogeochemical properties and biodiversity vary over multiple spatial scales from fine (< 10 m) to broad (> 10 km) scales. Differences in biogeochemistry were most pronounced at broad scales among the major lake basins of Taylor Valley corresponding to differences in geology and microclimate, while variation in invertebrate biodiversity and abundance occurred at landscape scales of 10-500 m, and within individual soil polygons. Variation in biogeochernistry and invertebrate communities across these scales reflects the influence of physical processes and landscape development over ecosystem structure in the dry valleys. The development of soil polygons influences the spatial patterning of soil properties such as soil organic matter, salinity, moisture, and invertebrate habitat suitability. Nematode abundance and life history data indicate that polygon interiors are more suitable habitats than soils in the troughs at the edges of polygons. These data Suggest that physical processes (i.e., polygon development) and biogeochemistry are important influences on the spatial variability of biotic communities in dry valley soil ecosystems.

AB The high trophic connectivity of many communities can produce large numbers of indirect interactions. Although many trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMII) are caused by changes in prey behavior, less is known about the effects of changes in predator behavior such as prey switching or multiple predator effects (MPE) on indirect interactions, especially in marine systems. We performed a series of field caging experiments off the Isles of Shoals, Maine (USA) from 2000 to 2002 to test for the presence of behaviorally mediated indirect effects in a shallow subtidal food web. Specifically, crab (Cancer borealis) predation on sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) was quantified in three habitats (Codium fragile algal beds, barrens, and mussel beds) representing differing combinations of food and shelter to examine the effects of prey switching by crabs. A second predator (the lobster, Homarus americanus) was added to the crab treatments to examine MPE effects.
   Urchin mortality was significantly lower in the mussel habitat than in the Codium. and barren habitats. Mussels produced a positive indirect effect on urchins by changing the behavior of crabs; crabs fed on mussels instead of urchins (prey switching). In the barrens, crab predation on urchins indirectly increased the abundance of the introduced ascidian, Diplosoma sp., whereas Codium density did not change among treatments.
   A significant risk reduction for urchins occurred in Codium and barren habitats, but not in mussel habitats when crabs and lobsters were combined. Lobsters also produced a positive indirect effect on mussels by reducing crab predation. Thus, lobsters modify crab behavior and dampen changes in community structure.
   Our results illustrate the importance of predator behavior and habitat context in modifying consumer pressure and community structure, and argue for the consideration of these factors in other multi-predator systems where habitats represent food and/or shelter.

AB A general binomial mixture model is proposed for the species accumulation function based on presence-absence (incidence) of species in a sample of quadrats or other sampling units. The model covers interpolation between zero and the observed number of samples, as well as extrapolation beyond the observed sample set. For interpolation (sample-based rarefaction), easily calculated, closed-form expressions for both expected richness and its confidence limits are developed (using the method of moments) that completely eliminate the need for resampling methods and permit direct statistical comparison of richness between sample sets. An incidence-based form of the Coleman (random-placement) model is developed and compared with the moment-based interpolation method. For extrapolation beyond the empirical sample set (and simultaneously, as an alternative method of interpolation), a likelihood-based estimator with a bootstrap confidence interval is described that relies on a sequential, AIC-guided algorithm to fit the mixture model parameters. Both the moment-based and likelihood-based estimators are illustrated with data sets for temperate birds and tropical seeds, ants, and trees. The moment-based estimator is confidently recommended for interpolation (sample-based rarefaction). For extrapolation, the likelihood-based estimator performs well for doubling or tripling the number of empirical samples, but it is not reliable for estimating the richness asymptote. The sensitivity of individual-based and sample-based rarefaction to spatial (or temporal) patchiness is discussed.

AB Multiple environmental factors may act synergistically to influence demographic characteristics, and ultimately the dynamics, of biological populations. Using prospective and retrospective analyses of demographic data from a 40-year study of individually marked animals, we investigated the demographic mechanisms of the temporal and spatial dynamics of a yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris) population. Prospective elasticity analyses indicated juvenile survival (P-j) would have the largest relative influence on the projected population growth rate (lambda). Relative magnitudes of elasticities did not differ between years characterized by positive (lambda > 1.0) and negative (lambda < 1.0) population growth. However, retrospective analyses of a life table response experiment (LTRE) revealed that changes in fertility (F), followed by age of first reproduction (alpha) made the largest contributions to observed annual changes in lambda. Changes in F and alpha made the largest contributions to annual declines in lambda, whereas changes in P-j also were important to cause increases in lambda. Population dynamic differences among marmot colonies were due primarily to spatial variations in alpha and P-j. Our results indicate that changes in reproductive parameters (a and F) primarily drive the temporal dynamics of our study population, and that demographic mechanisms of population increases might differ from those of population declines. Studies of the regulation of yellow-bellied marmot populations should focus on the factors or processes influencing reproductive parameters.

AB We investigated the role of individual variation among female red deer (Cervus elaphus) on the body mass of their offspring based on the long-term monitoring (1977-1996) of a Norwegian population. We studied 273 calves weighed in winter, belonging to 114 mothers of known age. After accounting for yearly variation, we found that calf body mass increased with the age of their mother until mothers were 6 years of age, then leveled off until 15 years of age. Body mass varied from year to year in similar ways for male and female calves. Winter harshness, and density when calves were in utero, could account for only a small part of this variation. Variation in calf body mass could be decomposed into a climatic component, determining the mean body mass of a cohort, and a mother component, determining the position of calves' body mass relative to the mean of their cohort. The mother effect could be further decomposed into an effect of the mother's age and an effect of the mother's quality. The latter explained >35% of the body mass variation in male calves, and similar to15% in females, while the proportions of the variation due to cohort effect were 28% and 42%, respectively. The mother's quality effect was therefore sex-specific and accounted for similar to1.5 times more of the variance in male than female body mass. Females with relatively long jawbones for their age had larger calves. We supported the hypothesis that female's quality influences the quality of her offspring and that this effect lingered until after the end of the weaning period. Our results suggest that the variance in reproductive success among females is certainly larger than previously thought in red deer.

AB The role functionally redundant species play in ecosystem function has not been adequately investigated. To study this, we examined species richness and an ecosystem function, cellulose decomposition, while environmental conditions were held constant. Our hypotheses were (1) increasing species richness will have no effect on rates of cellulose decomposition and (2) species richness will decline over time in functionally redundant communities. A relatively simple microcosm-based system to manipulate complex microbial interactions was employed. Microcosms containing cellulose as the sole carbon source were inoculated at equal densities with none, one, two, four, or eight species of cellulolytic bacteria. At 5-d intervals for 25 d, community composition and cellulose decomposition were determined. We rejected both of our hypotheses. In a constant environment, greater species richness supported a greater number of individuals and subsequently greater rates of total cellulose decomposition. Furthermore, greater initial species richness maintained greater richness over time. These results provide experimental evidence that functionally redundant species may play an integral role in ecosystem function.

AB I investigate a simple model of asymmetric competition, in which resource-holding potential (RHP) correlates with body size, the individuals with the highest RHP obtain the available territories (or other nondividable resources), and the population is regulated by the number of territories. Under these assumptions, I show that there is an optimal size strategy. Challenging a number of intuitive expectations, the model provides the following results: (1) The selection gradient on size may decrease (rather than increase) if population density is higher and competition is more intense; (2) the correlation between size and resource-holding potential may decrease during evolution, whereby size becomes irrelevant for competitive success; (3) assuming an offspring size-number trade-off and multiple clutches per year, the optimal size at birth may decrease (rather than increase) during the breeding season.

AB Metabolism, and thus population dynamics, can be limited by energy, carbon, nitrogen, and/or other nutrients. This is due to homeostasis, the relatively constant composition of biomass. Yet growth-rate-dependent changes in the composition of biomass do exist. The dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory provides the framework to deal with these simultaneous limitations and stoichiometric restrictions. We illustrate the application with three examples. First, we discuss simple single-species growth of a chemolithoautotroph to illustrate the interactions between nutrients and substrates in growth. We show how the macrochemical reaction equation with variable yield coefficients can be decomposed in a number of subprocesses with constant yield coefficients. We then discuss a simple predator-prey System, where nutrients are accumulated in the prey, which no longer have a constant composition of biomass. The implication is a varying conversion efficiency from prey to predator, with consequences for qualitative aspects of population dynamics. We illustrate the principles with a grazer (a heterotrophic consumer) feeding on algae (autotrophic producers). The algae frequently have an excess of energy in the form of carbohydrates, which are excreted and serve as food supplements for the heterotroph. This exchange of carbohydrates against nutrients is basic to a symbiosis, our third example of-application of DEB theory for solving stoichiometric problems in species interactions. The algae are no longer grazed as long as the grazer is able to extract nutrients from other sources. Depending on parameter values of the system, the coexistence can be very stable and further integrate into a single entity with mixotrophic properties. This process is basic to the evolution of the eukaryotic cell and to the organizational structure of metabolism. Mixotrophs can specialize under particular environmental conditions into autotrophs or heterotrophs, which again can associate in symbiotic relationships. The chemical composition of membranes testifies to the frequent occurrence of this process, which can now also be understood quantitatively.

AB In moving seeds from one location to another, dispersers define the ecological context that a plant will experience throughout its lifetime. Because seed deposition sites may benefit one plant life cycle stage but not others, dispersal may give rise to a conflict between a plant's dispersal needs (e.g., predator escape) and its requirements for successful establishment (e.g., suitable habitat). In this study, we assessed the effects of two components of seed dispersal by ants (seed burial depth and elaiosome removal) at several stages during the recruitment of Leucospermum truncatulum, an ant-dispersed plant from the fynbos shrublands of South Africa. A seed-predator exclusion experiment revealed that the removal of elaiosomes significantly reduced rodent predation on seeds buried I cm deep and increased the viability of seeds that were not consumed. In contrast, we found that elaiosomes had no effect on the probability of a living seed emerging as a seedling. In a seed burial depth experiment in which predators were not excluded, deeper burial significantly enhanced seed survival, but this benefit came at the expense of reduced seedling emergence, delayed emergence, and smaller cotyledon size. Despite the potential importance of these seedling characteristics, elaiosomes and burial depth had no significant effect on seedling survival through the first year of this study. In contrast, burial depth had strong positive effects on the fraction of seeds that persisted in the seed bank. Although dormant individuals may die before germinating and reproducing, those that persist at greater soil depths can play a crucial role in rescuing populations from local extinction in unpredictable environments. Given the extreme variability in fire frequency in fynbos, the net effect of seed dispersal by ants on plant populations will depend on how temporal fluctuations in fire regimes influence cost-benefit thresholds related to seed dormancy and seed mortality.

AB Demographic density dependence is essential for regulating population dynamics. For populations with multiple age or size cohorts, interactions between cohorts may be an important source of density dependence. Between-cohort interactions may be especially intense for many marine fish populations because of the potential disparity in competitive ability between small new recruits and relatively large resident conspecifics. Indeed, for marine fishes, density dependence in local populations appears to be widespread, particularly during a crucial time period following settlement of larvae into juvenile and adult habitats. I tested whether the demography of newly settled juveniles of the planktivorous fairy basslet (Gramma loreto) was affected by the density of adult conspecifics. Using spatially isolated local populations on coral reefs in the Bahamas, I experimentally transplanted a cohort of juveniles to local populations with three treatments of adult density: adults absent, average adult density, and high adult density (twice average). By following the fate of the transplanted juveniles, I determined that juvenile mortality increased as a function of adult density. Juveniles did not experience significantly higher rates of aggression or lower growth at higher densities of adults. However, in the presence of adults, juveniles generally fed at the back of aggregations, where feeding rates tend to be lower. Automated time-lapse video revealed that predators were found most frequently toward the back of aggregations. Thus competition with adults for prime feeding positions may increase predation risk for juveniles by forcing them to overlap spatially with predators. Consequently, interactions between juveniles and adults could influence the demography of subsequent generations in ways that promote local population regulation.

AB A new ordination method, called co-correspondence analysis, is developed to relate two types of communities (e.g., a plant community and an animal community) sampled at a common set of sites in a direct way. The method improves the simple, indirect approach of applying correspondence analysis (reciprocal averaging) to the separate species data sets and correlating the resulting ordination axes. Co-correspondence analysis maximizes the weighted covariance between weighted averaged species scores of one community and weighted averaged species scores of the other community. It thus attempts to identify the. patterns that are common to both communities. Both a symmetric descriptive, and an asymmetric predictive form are developed. The symmetric form relates to co-inertia analysis and the asymmetric, predictive form to partial least-squares regression. In two examples the predictive power of co-correspondence analysis is compared with that of canonical correspondence analyses on syntaxonomic and environmental data. In the first example, carabid beetles in roadside verges are shown to be more closely related to plant species composition than to vegetation structure (biomass, height, roughness, among others), and, in the second example, bryophytes in spring meadows are shown to be more closely related to the species composition of the vascular plants than to the measured water chemistry.

AB It is now well appreciated that most organisms can alter their phenotypes when faced with environmental variation. Decades of empirical investigations have documented hundreds of examples of phenotypic plasticity, yet most studies have focused on the presence-or absence of a single environmental factor. As a result, we know little about how organisms respond to-gradients of environmental factors (i.e., threshold responses vs. continuous responses), nor do we understand how organisms respond to combinations of environmental variables. I examined how larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) altered their behavior, morphology, and growth in response, to combined gradients of predation and competition. Increased predation risk induced lower activity, deeper tails, and shorter bodies, which collectively caused slower growth. Increased competition caused slower growth which induced higher activity, shallower tails, and longer bodies: For both environmental gradients, the responses were frequently continuous rather than threshold responses. Moreover, predation and competition had interactive effects. Responses to predators were always larger under low competition than under high competition. Responses to competition were larger under low predation risk when predation and competition induced traits in the same direction, but larger under high predation risk when predation and competition induced traits in opposite directions. The results demonstrate that responses to phenotypically plastic traits can be fine-tuned to a wide variety of environmental combinations.

AB Habitat recognition and selective settlement by dispersive propagules greatly increases the post-settlement survival chances of sessile organisms. To better understand the key role some species can play in the structure of highly complex coral reef ecosystems, we compare the role of two independent, but sequential processes: settlement choice and post-settlement survival. This study describes the chemical and physical recognition and ranking of specific settlement substrata by coral larvae. Several species of crustose coralline algae (CCA) are known to induce coral settlement however they also employ physical and biological anti-settlement defense strategies that vary greatly in effectiveness. We examine the interactions between settling larvae of two common reef building coral species (Acropora tenuis and A. millepora) and five species of CCA (Neogoniolithon fosliei, Porolithon onkodes, Hydrolithon reinboldii, Titanoderma prototypum, and Lithoporello melobesioides) that co-occur on reef crests and slopes of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Distinct settlement patterns were observed when coral larvae were provided with a choice of settlement substrata. Settlement on the most preferred substratum, the CCA species T. prototypum, was 15 times higher than on N. fosliei, the least preferred substratum. The rates of post-settlement survival of the corals also varied between CCA species in response to their anti-settlement strategies (shedding of surface cell layers, overgrowth, and potential chemical deterrents). Rates of larval settlement, post-settlement survival, and the sensitivity of larvae to chemical extracts of CCA were all positively correlated across the five species of CCA. Nonliving settlement substrata on coral reefs is sparser consequently the fact that only a few CCA species (notably T. prototypum) facilitate coral recruitment, has important implications for structuring the reef ecosystem.

AB It is generally assumed that tree growth in the upper limit of a forest is mainly controlled by summer temperature. This general statement is mostly based on studies from extra-tropical mountains and has been rarely evaluated in subtropical latitudes frequently characterized by drier climates. In the subtropical mountains from Northwestern Argentina (similar to23degrees S), annual precipitation decreases with elevation from > 1500 mm at 12001500 m. to <200 mm above 4000 m. In consequence, tree growth at high elevations in the region may be seriously limited by water supply. In order to assess the influence of precipitation on tree growth, we evaluated the relationships between climatic variations and radial growth in four species growing at different altitudinal zones: Juglans australis from the montane cloud forest at 1800 m; Alnus acuminata from the montane savanna-like woodland at 2700 m; Prosopis ferox from the subalpine dryland at 3500 m; and Polylepis tarapacana from the high-elevation alpine dryland at 4750 m. Dendrochronological techniques were used to relate variations in annual ring width with instrumental climatic records. Growth rings were correctly dated to the year of formation, and the cross-dated series standardized using autoregressive models to reduce non-climatic signals present in the records. Tree-ring chronologies, ranging from 117 to 341 years, were compared, during the common period, with instrumental climatic records using correlation-function analysis. In spite of the remarkable differences in elevation and environmental conditions among the sampling sites, correlation functions with climate indicated that the radial growth of the four species is largely controlled by precipitation. In most cases, increased precipitation during the previous and current growing seasons favors tree growth, while temperatures are negatively correlated with radial growth, likely due to the negative effect on water availability. These results indicate that the generalized idea of upper-treeline growth limited by summer temperatures should be carefully evaluated in low-latitude environments and does not apply to subtropical areas with severe water deficits or strong moisture seasonalities.

DE behavioral interference; character displacement; geometric
   morphometrics; Plethodon
ID EVOLUTION; COMPETITION; SELECTION; BEHAVIOR; ABILITY; SHAPE
AB Ecological character displacement occurs when sympatric species compete with one another, resulting in morphological divergence. Theoretically, character displacement can evolve from a number of ecological interactions, such as exploitation, interference, or predation, but most examples describe species competing exploitatively for limiting resources (typically food). Here I report a case of character displacement evolving from aggressive behavioral interference, found in a well-studied system of terrestrial salamanders of the genus Plethodon. Using geometric morphometrics, I found parallel shifts in head shape from allopatry to sympatry in both P. jordani and P. teyahalee, and found significantly greater morphological divergence in sympatry relative to allopatry. Both findings are consistent with ecological character displacement. I also show a significant association between morphology and aggressive behavior, demonstrating a direct link between interference competition and morphology. I present a modified set of the criteria for character displacement that are appropriate for discriminating character displacement via aggressive interference from other possible evolutionary mechanisms. For this example, empirical support satisfying five of the six criteria for character displacement is found. These results provide evidence that morphological variation can be generated by mechanisms other than resource exploitation, which has profound implications for interpreting patterns of biological diversity.

AB The effects of early-season herbivory and subsequent induced plant responses have the potential to affect the diversity of herbivorous insect communities. We investigated the seasonal development of the herbivore fauna on common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) to understand the effect of early-season herbivory by different species on insect growth, natural colonization, and community composition. First, we showed that damage by an early-season stem-feeding weevil (Rhyssomatus lineaticollis) reduced growth of monarch larvae (Danaus plexippus) and leaf beetle larvae (Labidomera clivicollis), suggesting that plant quality is reduced by weevil damage. To better understand the potential for initial herbivore damage to affect subsequent colonization by herbivores in the field, we compared undamaged controls to plants experimentally damaged with one of three herbivores: weevils, monarchs, or leaf beetles. We counted seven species of naturally colonizing herbivores on all plants for the next two months to assess colonization, damage, and insect community richness. Our results showed that initial herbivory by different species altered host plant use by herbivores in two years of experiments. Similarly, induced resistance and susceptibility occurred in both years, but due to different initial damaging species on individual plants. Treatment effects also scaled up to alter herbivore community richness. Initial treatments varied in their persistence through the season. For example, in 2001, the influence of initial monarch damage dissipated due to subsequent damage by colonizing herbivores, but the impacts of initial weevil treatment were unaffected. This result suggests that, although induced responses to weevil feeding persisted through the season, monarch herbivory was more likely to affect the herbivore community via a cascade of indirect effects. In 2002, plant and insect responses were more specific, depending on the identity of both initial and colonizing herbivore species. Despite year-to-year variation, considerable consistency in many responses to our treatments indicates that the identity of the initially colonizing herbivore can affect subsequent plant use and community structure. Given the preponderance of influential early-season herbivores, the effects of induced plant responses similar to those presented here may be widespread and may strongly contribute to the structure of phytophagous insect communities.

AB Determinants of the balance between grass and woody vegetation in grasslands and savannas have received considerable attention because of the potential for dramatic shifts in ecosystem structure and function as one growth form replaces the other. We studied a mesic grassland where recently established "shrub islands" are increasing in abundance due to fire suppression. Our objective was to assess the role of the direct effects of fire vs. indirect alterations in resource availability (N and light), as mechanisms that may constrain/facilitate shrub (Cornus drummondii) encroachment.
   The direct effects of fire in 2001 and 2002 were 100% aboveground mortality of C. drummondii shoots and removal of the detrital layer. Post-fire resprouting resulted in similar to600% increase in stem density compared to a 200% increase in shrub islands protected from fire. In burned shrub islands with an added detrital layer, temperature and light penetration to the soil surface were reduced (by 6.5degreesC and to <3% of full sunlight), but stem density still increased by similar to400%. Thus, both the direct effects of fire and the indirect effect on the energy environment increased C. drummondii stem densities. In contrast, N additions did not influence new stem production or aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP; grams per square meter per year), suggesting that N availability did not constrain shrub growth during this study. While fire did not impact total ANPP, it did shift the relative, abundance of growth forms. Grass productivity (360.7 +/- 20.1 g/m(2) [mean +/- 1 SE]) was stimulated (an increase of similar to30%) by the high light conditions of the post-fire environment, while C. drummondii ANPP (34.2 +/- 2.4 g/m(2)) was reduced by similar to30%. In shrub islands protected from fire, C. drummondii ANPP was greatest (50.4 +/- 2.2 g/m(2)), whereas lower graminoid ANPP (282.5 +/- 19.9 g/m(2)) was observed. The persistence of woody vegetation, despite two successive fires, along with a significant reduction in grass ANPP (similar to30%) suggests that once established, C. drummondii can persist and exclude C, grasses. Thus, restoring fire to mesic grasslands may prevent further conversion to shrub/woodland, but the abundance of shrubs is likely to remain unchanged with community structure co-dominated by multiple growth forms.

AB The ability of predators to reduce prey populations is generally ascribed to the consumption of prey individuals. However, predators may also induce behavioral changes in prey, individuals, which can reduce prey survival and reproduction. Pea aphid populations are impacted by a variety of predators, many of which induce escape responses in individual aphids. We created disturbance-only predators (surgically manipulated predators that were unable to consume prey, but were still able to forage and interact with prey) and measured their ability to suppress aphid population growth over a six-day period. The greatest reduction in aphid population growth was caused by normal predators that were able to both consume and disturb aphids, but aphid population growth was also strongly reduced by nonconsumptive, disturbance-only predators. These field experiments are the first to show that predators reduce prey population growth partly through predator-induced changes in prey behavior, as well as through consumption of prey individuals.

AB Traits that are attractive to mutualists may also attract antagonists, resulting in conflicting selection pressures. Here we develop the idea that increased floral nectar production can, in some cases, increase herbivory. In these situations, selection for increased nectar production to attract pollinators may be constrained by a linked cost of herbivore attraction. In support of this hypothesis, we report that experimentally supplementing nectar rewards in Datura stramonium led to increased oviposition by Manduca sexta, a sphingid moth that pollinates flowers, but whose larvae feed on leaf tissue. We speculate that nectar composition may provide information about plant nutritional status or defense that floral visitors could use to make oviposition decisions. Thus, selection by floral visitors and leaf herbivores may be inextricably intertwined, and herbivores may represent a relatively unexplored agent of selection on nectar traits.

AB The understanding of nitrogen dynamics in streams of temperate forest biomes historically has been constrained by a combination of anthropogenic disturbances and technical limitations. We report here on a study in an undisturbed stream in Oregon, USA, using a stable isotopic tracer to quantify uptake, transformation, and retention of nitrogen. We added (NH4Cl)-N-15 for six weeks to Mack Creek, a third-order stream in a 500-year-old-growth coniferous forest and monitored N-15 in dissolved, aquatic, and terrestrial riparian food web components. Data collected before, during, and for four weeks after the tracer addition allowed us to derive uptake rates of inorganic N and to trace its fates. Short uptake lengths (35-55 m) and residence times (8-12 min) of ammonium indicated strong demand. Despite nitrate concentrations of 55-68 mug/L, nitrification rates were also high, with 40-50% of the (NH4+)-N-15 converted to nitrate over the 220-m study reach. Aquatic bryophytes and biofilm on large wood ("epixylon") showed the highest biomass-adjusted uptake rates. All aquatic consumers sampled, both vertebrate and invertebrate, showed incorporation of tracer 15 N by the end of the experiment; small invertebrate grazers were more strongly labeled than their food sources. Increased 15 N label in 15 of the 17 riparian plant species sampled suggested transfer of aquatic N to the terrestrial ecosystem. At the end of the release, 81% of the added tracer was accounted for, with 49% exported (primarily as (NO3-)-N-15) and 32% retained within the stream and riparian biota (primarily by bryophytes, epixylon, and fine benthic organic material). Our results suggest that, in streams within undisturbed primary forests, uptake and retention of nitrogen may be highly efficient and that there may be strong connections between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

AB Plants are under siege from a diversity of enemies that consume both leaf and floral parts. Plants resist damage to leaves in a variety of ways, and we now have a rich literature documenting how plants defend themselves against herbivore attack. In contrast, the mechanisms by which plants resist enemies that consume floral parts or resources are much less known, even though damage to floral tissue usually has tighter links to plant fitness than damage to leaf tissue. Many plants experience nectar robbing, whereby floral visitors remove nectar from flowers, often without pollinating. Nectar robbers can reduce plant fitness to degrees comparable to, or even surpassing, reduction by herbivores. However, because nectar attracts both pollinators and nectar robbers, plants face a dilemma in defending against nectar robbers without also deterring pollinators. Here, we extend the conceptual framework of resistance to herbivores to include resistance to nectar robbers, focusing on nectar traits. We review published data and find that an array of nectar traits may deter robbers without deterring pollinators. Although resistance traits against robbers have been broadly identified, the costs and benefits of these traits in terms of plant fitness remain poorly understood. We present data showing that a nectar trait (dilute nectar) might directly, as well as indirectly, benefit plant fitness by deterring nectar-robbing bumble bees of Ipomopsis aggregata without deterring hummingbird pollinators. However, the magnitude of any plant fitness benefit will depend on the degree to which plants are pollen- vs. resource-limited in a given year. The results of our work offer both conceptual and empirical insight into how plants cope with attack by nonpollinating floral visitors through a relatively unexplored trait, nectar.

AB Ecological stoichiometry is a useful tool for studying how the elemental composition of organisms and their food affects production, nutrient cycling, and food-web dynamics. Two analyses are presented here that show that the use of simple element ratios in stoichiometric calculations may in certain circumstances prove inadequate because of the influence in animal nutrition of biochemical aspects of diet. In the first, a stoichiometric analysis of herbivores consuming food with varying carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratios is undertaken, in which the intake of C is segregated into easily assimilated compounds and fiber. Two herbivore strategies emerge from the analysis, both as a means of minimizing limitation by C, not N: fiber eaters that consume high C:N food and have efficient fiber digestion, and selective feeders that consume low C:N food but that do not possess fiber-digesting enzymes. In the second example, the stoichiometric axiom that a single substrate, the one in least supply relative to demand, limits growth is used to identify potentially limiting essential amino acids in the diets of a range of animals. Large consumer-prey imbalances in amino acids were found in several cases, indicating that, at least in theory, growth should be strongly limited by individual amino acids rather than bulk N. In practice such limitation may be offset in consumers by physiological and other factors such as symbiotic relationships. The two analyses emphasize the simplicity of element stoichiometry, highlighting the need to consider biochemical and physiological arguments when undertaking stoichiometric studies of carbon and nutrient transfers in ecosystems.

AB How introduced species displace native species is often poorly understood. Various studies suggest that several species of native ladybird beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) have declined in abundance in particular habitats (especially crops) and/or geographic regions following the colonization of North America by the seven-spotted ladybird beetle (Coccinella septempunctata L.). However, the factors responsible for such declines are unclear. Long-term sampling of alfalfa fields in northern Utah revealed that as C. septempunctata established itself and increased in numbers, densities of native species decreased significantly over the period 1992-2001. The decline in numbers of native ladybirds mirrored a decline in numbers of their principal prey in alfalfa, pea aphids. Field experiments with induced aphid outbreaks were conducted to test the hypothesis that dispersing native adults have shifted their foraging efforts away from alfalfa as the introduced species has increased in numbers and depressed prey availability. As predicted by the hypothesis, native ladybirds rapidly reaccumulated in alfalfa when prey became abundant. Their presence was brief, however, as they and especially the more numerous C. septempunctata quickly suppressed experimental aphid outbreaks. The ratio of densities within experimental plots with high aphid numbers to densities in the surrounding field was greater for native ladybirds than for C. septempunctata. Also, densities of native ladybirds varied more closely with aphid densities among fields in late May 2001 than did densities of C. septempunctata. Hence, native ladybirds appear especially responsive to local aphid density. C. septempunctata's impact on aphid density in alfalfa appears to have reduced significantly the degree to which the habitat retains foraging native adults. Thus, introduced species may influence the distribution and abundance of native competitors not only by reducing survivorship in local habitats, but also by altering the dynamics of dispersal and habitat use across the landscape.

AB While host stress in vertebrate populations has often been linked to outbreaks of epidemics, which are attributed to the immuno-compromise of the stressed hosts, no predictions have been made about the response of invertebrate host populations to stressful conditions. Experiments conducted on individual invertebrate hosts, however, suggest that starved hosts may be a poor resource for parasites and that heavily infected old hosts may be more susceptible to stress, causing parasite populations to decline when their host population faces food shortages. In this epidemiological experiment, we exposed infected and uninfected Daphnia magna populations, which had been kept for many generations under a constant high food supply, to reduced food resources. Using the, microsporidian gut parasite Glugoides intestinalis, which is exclusively horizontally transmitted, we tracked changes in parasite and host population size as well as host body length to elucidate how food shortages for the hosts influence host and parasite population dynamics. In both infected and uninfected populations, food shortage led to an approximately equal reduction in host density and changes in host body length distribution. Large hosts suffered a higher mortality than smaller hosts, which significantly reduced the mean body length in the host populations; however, this change was stronger in the infected populations and went hand in-hand with a reduction in parasite spore load (a measure of intensity of infection) and prevalence. This effect disappeared after six weeks of food shortage, when the populations reached a new equilibrium. Our results indicate that in this system food stress impairs parasite spread and that host mortality is an important factor in regulating parasite abundance at the population level.

AB Understanding relationships between the size of individuals and their subsequent survival can not only provide insights into mechanisms of mortality, but can also identify traits to measure for monitoring at-risk populations. We analyzed a data set of more than 54000 juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from 15 populations over five years. The juveniles were tagged during the summer in their freshwater rearing habitats and then recaptured at downstream sites the following spring after an extended rearing and overwintering period. We measured the length and weight of fish at tagging and computed a "condition index" that determined how fat or thin a fish was relative to others. Among populations, mean length and mean condition index were poor predictors of survival, but we did detect year and site effects. Within populations, survival was strongly related to the relative length of individuals but not to relative condition index. Our results are consistent with length-related mechanisms of mortality mediated by hierarchical behavior, and thus merely measuring changes in mean values of morphological traits in populations of juveniles may provide little insight into expected changes in population viability. Expanding upon these results, we predicted a nearly 60% increase in selection for juvenile fish length when we extended our observation period through adulthood. Thus, monitoring populations through only a portion of their life history may present an incomplete picture of their survival variability.
