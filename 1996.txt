AB Differential response of genotypes to temporal environmental heterogeneity may contribute to the long-term persistence of those genotypes within a population. We tested whether season-dependent fitness components of genotypes could be responsible for the maintenance of genetic diversity within a population. Clonal replicates of five genotypes of Taraxacum officinale were planted in each of four seasons (spring-April to July, summer-July to October, autumn-October to January, and winter-January to April), Individuals were planted directly into natural, field vegetation. Fitness components (establishment, survival, growth, seed production, and leaf area dominance) and an integrated measure of fitness (finite rate of increase) were measured for each genotype in each season. Differential genotypic responses to seasons were observed for all fitness components. Despite seasonal differences, genotypic performances summed across seasons were equivalent. This result indicates that temporal heterogeneity may have a substantial effect on within-population genetic structure. The persistence of genotypes of contrasting seasonal performance through time is expected if long-term fitness values remain similar.

AB A seasonal decline in reproductive success is common to many birds breeding in seasonal environments. We examined the reproductive success of Thick-billed Murres breeding at Coats Island, Northwest Territories, Canada to assess the extent to which a seasonal decline in success could be accounted for by correlations between the age of the birds and their date of laying. In 1990 and 1991 reproductive success declined with date of laying: this decline was due mainly to a decline in the proportion of eggs that hatched. No corresponding decline was found in the proportion of hatchlings that reached fledging age. Pairs containing at least one young (4- or 5-yr-old) bird laid later and hatched a lower proportion of eggs than those containing at least one older (>7-yr-old) bird. The two groups did not differ in the proportion of hatchlings reared. When looked at separately, the proportions of young and older birds that succeeded in hatching their egg were not affected by date of laying. When the two age groups were combined, the trends with date were similar to those found for a large sample, mostly birds of unknown age. To correct for differences in timing of laying, a sample of early breeders was induced to lay replacement eggs 14 d later. These experimental pairs were as successful as early control breeders. A greater proportion of the experimentally delayed pairs hatched chicks than birds laying for the first time at a similar date. The experimental pairs were also more successful than young birds that bred earlier. The growth of experimental and control chicks did not differ. However, the 14-d-old chicks of young pairs were lighter than those of experienced breeders, suggesting poorer provisioning by the young breeders. We concluded that there was no evidence for a deterioration in feeding conditions with date and that the relationship between age and/or experience and date of laying was the most important factor in causing the decline in reproductive success with date. Our conclusions may apply to other studies of reproductive success in marine birds.

AB The field metabolic rate (FMR) of nesting Northern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) was measured using the doubly labeled water technique. Although some labeled Northern Fulmars showed marked differences in behavior compared to controls, FMR did not change correspondingly. At-sea FMR averaged 1444 kJ/d, equivalent to 4.5 x basal metabolic rate (BMR). As a multiple of BMR it was independent of sex, wing length, body mass, mass change, and duration of the period at sea, but was strongly dependent on wind speed, being higher during slack winds. There was also a trend for higher wingbeat frequency at winds too low for sustained dynamic soaring. The high energetic cost of flapping flight during windless conditions may explain patterns of nest attendance: in particular, why nest site attendance by Northern Fulmars in winter is greater during calm weather. Lack of wind might limit the breeding range of this species and other Procellariiformes with high flapping-flight costs.

AB The ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation include the direct effects of habitat loss and the indirect effects of reduced inter-patch dispersal. In particular, habitat patches that survive the process of fragmentation become increasingly isolated from one another, and this can cause species' declines in excess of predictions based strictly on reductions in habitat area. To quantify the hindrance of-dispersal caused by habitat fragmentation, landscape ecologists have invented the notion of habitat connectivity. Indices of landscape pattern are frequently used to estimate habitat connectivity, but whether they actually do so remains undocumented. If indices of habitat pattern do indeed estimate habitat connectivity, then these indices should correlate well with predictions of dispersal success. To test this possibility, I looked for correlations between nine common indices of habitat pattern and the results of a simulated dispersal process conducted using GIS data on the distribution of old-growth forest through the Pacific Northwest. The nine indices of habitat pattern that I examined were only weakly correlated with the results from the dispersal modeling, but I identified a new pattern index, termed patch cohesion, for which the fit was much better. Moreover, I found patch cohesion to be insensitive to the details and artifacts of the dispersal model. The methodology described here will be useful to investigators using indices of-landscape pattern to quantify habitat fragmentation.

AB The rate of increase of a population depends on the age- or stage-specific vital rates (survival, reproduction, etc.). Sensitivity analysis explores this dependence by calculating the fir st derivatives of the rate of increase with respect to each of the vital rates, and has become a standard part of demographic analysis. This paper presents a formula for the second derivatives, for the case where the rate of increase is measured by the dominant eigenvalue lambda of a population projection matrix. Because the first derivatives of lambda are written in terms of the eigenvectors, the second derivatives of lambda can be written in terms of the first derivatives of the eigenvectors. I present examples of the second derivatives of lambda in age- and size-classified life cycles, and discuss several potential applications of the results: (1) the perturbation analysis of elasticity patterns with applications to conservation biology, (2) the sensitivity analysis of stochastic growth rates, (3) the inclusion of second-order terms in the decomposition analysis of life table response experiments, and (4) the analysis of directional, stabilizing, and correlational selection on life history traits.

AB To study the effects of different predators on the behavior and dynamics of their prey, we compared the performance of perch (Perca fluviatilis) and the abundance of their prey resource in four lakes with two different types of piscivory. In two of the lakes, perch were the only fish species present and piscivory was restricted to cannibalism. In the other two lakes, perch co-occurred with piscivorous pike (Esox lucius). Pike grow to larger sizes and can capture larger prey than piscivorous perch. Therefore, perch reach a size refuge earlier in the lakes without pike.
   Perch in the lakes lacking pike used both the epilimnion and hypolimnion habitats of the lakes, and a high proportion of the perch occurred below the thermocline. In contrast, perch in the lakes with pike were mainly captured along the littoral zone and were never captured below the thermocline. This difference in habitat use was reflected in different diets of perch in the different lakes. Perch in the lakes with pike were also less abundant than those in the lakes lacking pike and the growth rates of individual perch and the densities of predator-sensitive prey (pelagic and littoral) were higher, indicating that the presence of pike resulted in decreased intraspecific competition in perch. Evidence for a behavioral response to predation risk was found in 1+ (1 yr old) perch, which was suggested to be due to predation risk from both larger perch and pike. It is hypothesized that the use of the cold-water hypolimnion habitat by perch in the lakes lacking pike was a response of perch to reduce metabolic demands under conditions of severe resource limitation.
   Differences in gape limitation between predators species are suggested to have major effects on size-dependent mortalities and growth rates in prey and thereby on overall community dynamics. Evidence for this latter effect was observed in differences in zooplankton size structure between the lakes with and without pike.

AB Variation in shade tolerance is a primary mechanism driving succession in northern deciduous forests. However, little is known about interspecific differences in the traits responsible for shade tolerance. Is shade tolerance due to the ability to grow or survive in deep shade, or both? How do plant morphology and photosynthesis relate to growth in shade? Is low light the sole critical stress determining differences in ''shade tolerance'' or do belowground resources interact with low light to affect growth and survival? In this study we address these questions for seedlings of Betula papyrifera Marsh., Betula alleghaniensis Britton, Ostrya virginiana (Mill.) K. Koch, Acer saccharum Marsh., and Quercus rubra L. grown for 2 yr in outdoor shade houses in a complete factorial of low light (2 and 8% open sky) and nitrogen (forest soil and forest soil plus 200 kg N . ha(-1) . yr(-1)). For these seedlings we examined effects of light and nitrogen on the interrelationships among survival, growth, and shade tolerance and explored the physiological bases of shade tolerance by examining the relationship of plant morphology and photosynthesis to growth.
   Nitrogen amendments did not have a significant effect on any plant trait at either light level. In 8% light, growth and survival were highest for shade-intolerant Betula papyrifera and mid-tolerant Betula alleghaniensis, lower for shade-tolerant Ostrya and Acer, and lowest for disturbance-adapted Quercus. In 2% light, species rankings reversed as Ostrya and Acer had higher growth and survival than the other species. Second-year survival was strongly related to 1 st-yr growth (P < 0.001), whereas relationships with 1 st-yr plant mass and 1 st-yr absolute growth rates were weak. Therefore, survival of shade-tolerant species at 2% light was related to their maintenance of positive growth, whereas intolerant species had growth near zero and high rates of mortality. In both 2 and 8% light photosynthetic rates on mass (but not area) bases and the proportion of the plant in leaves (leaf area ratio and leaf mass ratio) were positively related to growth. Greater rates of growth and survival for shade-tolerant species in very low light, and for intolerant species in higher light, suggest that there is a species-based trade-off between maximizing growth in high light and minimizing the light compensation point for growth. This trade off may be an important mechanism driving forest community dynamics in northern hardwood forests.

AB This paper examines the role of pollen digestion in the early breeding of Darwin's finches. Pollen is a rich source of protein, but the extent to which birds digest pollen has been debated. On Isla Daphne Major, Galapagos, Geospiza scandens, the Cactus Finch, and G. fortis, the Medium Ground Finch, consume pollen and nectar of the prickly pear cactus, Opuntia echios. I found that >90% of ingested pollen was digested during passage through the gut of adult and nestling G. scandens and adult G. fortis. This value is twice as high as the maximum reported for birds, and comparable to the most efficient digestion known for specialist marsupials. Nectar is ingested with pollen by the finches and may stimulate germination of pollen in the crop, facilitating digestion. Opuntia pollen grains germinated in vitro in a nectar and water solution.
   Breeding of finches typically follows shortly after the arrival of the first heavy rains of the year. In 6 of 12 years, however, some G. scandens pairs bred and successfully fledged young before onset of the rains. At these times, Opuntia flowers were abundant, arthropods were scarce, and the diet of G. scandens was predominantly Opuntia pollen and nectar. As a result of breeding early, pre-rains breeders produced more clutches and fledged more young per year than post-rains breeders. Although G. fortis take pollen and nectar from Opuntia flowers and efficiently digest pollen grains, they feed on flowers to a much lesser extent than G. scandens, and did not breed before the rains. These results have implications for similar vertebrate pollinator and plant systems in arid tropical regions.

AB The effect of elevated CO2 on plant-microbial interactions and nitrogen (N) cycling is critical to predicting plant growth responses to elevated CO2, because plant growth is often N-limited. We investigated whether the effects of elevated CO2 on plant-microbial N dynamics differed among six annual plant species: three European grasses that have invaded California grasslands, and one grass and two forbs native to California serpentine grassland. Elevated CO2 altered plant N pools and (NH4+)-N-15 uptake, but the direction and magnitude of the changes were species dependent. The introduced grasses showed increased plant N pools and (NH4+)-N-15 uptake, whereas the native species showed smaller increases or even decreases in plant N pools and N-15(4)+ uptake. Under nutrient enrichment, soil microbial N and (NH4+)-N-15 uptake differed among soils with different plant species, but they were not affected by elevated CO2. At low nutrients, elevated CO2 altered soil microbial N and (NH4+)-N-15 uptake, but the direction and magnitude of the changes were species dependent. The changes in soil microbial N were positively correlated with changes in the plant N pool, suggesting that there was no trade-off in N uptake between plants and microbes. These results also suggest that plant species composition will partly determine the direction of changes in soil N cycling in response to elevated CO2.

Fine root NPP was not correlated to TRCA-RN; however, a strong correlation was found between NPPfr and TRCA-RN for five control Pinus resinosa natural forests and plantations. The poor correlation between measured TRCA or NPPfr and the estimates may be due to interspecies differences in belowground carbon allocation, variation in foliage:root carbon allocation ratios due to water and nutrient availability, and violations in the carbon budget approach. Using the Raich and Nadelhoffer model to estimate total root carbon allocation and to construct stand carbon budgets for a stand is not an acceptable substitute for measuring soil carbon fluxes.

AB In theory, predator-prey pairs with extinction-prone local populations can persist through metapopulation dynamics, wherein local populations fluctuate asynchronously, occasionally providing dispersers that prevent permanent extinction in all patches. A few studies have shown that spatial structure can extend predator-prey persistence. However, no studies have unequivocally demonstrated the asynchrony among patches, low dispersal rates, and rescue effects that prove metapopulation dynamics extend persistence. We used a protist predator-prey pair to show that spatial subdivision lengthens persistence through metapopulation dynamics. The pair comprised the predaceous ciliate, Didinium nasutum, feeding on the bacterivorous ciliate, Colpidium cf. striatum. A replicated experiment assessed how habitat subdivision affects persistence. Undivided habitats were of four volumes: 30, 180, 270, and 750 mt. Subdivided microcosms, or ''arrays,'' were groups of nine or 25 linked 30-mL bottles (270 or 750 mt total volume). In arrays, predators and prey persisted for 130 d (602 prey and 437 predator generations), at which point the experiment ended. Predators went extinct in undivided microcosms of equivalent volumes within a mean of only 70 d. Predators persisted for a mean of just 19 d in isolated 30-mL bottles (equivalent to isolated patches of arrays). In a separate experiment, prey were driven extinct in four of 15 isolated 30-mL bottles, and persistence times of predators were broadly similar. We documented the following hallmarks of metapopulation dynamics: (1) asynchronous fluctuations in different subpopulations; (2) frequent local prey extinctions and recolonizations; (3) persistence of protists in arrays, despite extinction of isolated local populations; and (4) rescue effects in predator populations.
   Other experiments measured dispersal rates and the effects on local dynamics of immigrant predators and prey, and initial predator : prey ratios. Only a small fraction of protists dispersed within a generation, consistent with metapopulation dynamics. Immigration of predators increased the frequency of local extinctions of prey, and immigration of prey increased the persistence of both predators and prey. Higher initial predator:prey ratios decreased the persistence of prey in undivided volumes.
   Although the pair persisted regionally in arrays, data indicated that local extinctions of prey were common. In array patches, predator:prey ratios were higher and predator-prey cycles were shorter than in undivided volumes. Dispersal made local dynamics more prone to extinction, yet promoted regional persistence because the risk of extinction of distant subpopulations became independent.

AB Laboratory experiments show that temperature can play an important role in modifying the effect of toxic cyanobacteria on freshwater, planktonic herbivores. A reproductive-rate assay assessed the effect of temperature on the response of Brachionus calyciflorus and Asplanchna girodi to Anabaena flos-aquae and its endotoxin, anatoxin-a. Using a bootstrap technique, reproductive rates (lambda, from r(m)) in experimental and control treatments were determined from complete life tables, and responses were expressed as mean ratios of these rates (experimental rate as a fraction of control rate) with asymmetric 95% confidence limits determined nonparametrically from distributions of bootstrapped ratios. Thus, at all temperatures, exposure to treatments was over a standard period of physiological or developmental time-one lifetime or generation. In rotifers acclimated for many generations to low (12 degrees-14 degrees C), intermediate (19 degrees C), and high (25 degrees-26 degrees C) temperatures, susceptibility to the cyanobacterium and its toxin increased significantly with temperature; ratios of lambda values were 1.5-2 times greater at the low than at the high temperatures. The results indicate that seasonal increases in water temperature, and climate warming, may exacerbate the impact of toxic cyanobacteria on rotifers and perhaps other zooplankton taxa.

AB A Planktivore Lake with small herbivorous zooplankton and a Piscivore Lake with large grazers were monitored for 2 yr and then enriched for 2 yr with inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen. An unenriched lake with an undisturbed fish community served as a reference ecosystem. Added nutrients increased biomass of both phytoplankton and zooplankton. In the Planktivore Lake, phytoplankton were stimulated more than zooplankton. This situation was reversed in the Piscivore Lake. Time series models predicting chlorophyll from P input rate and crustacean length fit well for total chlorophyll and the edible fraction (<35 mu m), but were less successful for the large fraction (>35 mu m). A 1-mm change in mean crustacean length had about the same effect on chlorophyll as a decrease in P input rate of 1 mg . m(-3) . d(-1). There was no evidence of interaction between grazer and P input effects. Although effects of grazers and P input are equal and additive, the range of mean crustacean lengths among lakes is approximate to 1 mm, while the range of P input rates is substantially >1 mg . m(-3) . d(-1). Therefore, the potential for increasing eutrophication by P input exceeds the potential for controlling eutrophication by food web manipulation. Nevertheless, biomanipulation can reduce chlorophyll concentration at P input rates of 1.5 mg . m(-3) . d(-1) or more; these rates characterize a large fraction of the world's stratified lakes.

AB Phenomena such as disturbance play a major role in structuring ecological systems by producing a spatiotemporal mosaic of patches at different successional states. The distribution of species within the resulting mosaic depends upon an interaction between species' life history traits and the spatial and temporal structure of the ecological processes controlling species' distributions. We have used a spatially explicit simulation model (JASPER) Of a serpentine grassland to examine the importance of some of these relationships, focusing primarily on the role of disturbance. The model JASPER is hierarchical in design and was developed to simulate the population dynamics of three interacting plant species: Bromus mollis, Calycadenia multiglandulosa, and Plantago erecta. Population dynamics were modeled as occurring within local sites, which were then arranged in a square array to form a landscape. Connections among sites within a landscape were made primarily through seed dispersal.
   Several components of disturbance architecture were varied systematically among model runs to determine their impact on population dynamics at the scale of the landscape. We considered three levels of organization in modeling disturbance: (1) overall rate of disturbance, (2) size of individual disturbances, and (3) temporal and spatial autocorrelation among individual disturbances. The results demonstrate that the impact of disturbance depends upon a complex interaction between the life history characteristics of the species making up the community and the spatial and temporal structure of the disturbance regime. For example, we found that the biggest impact on species abundance occurred in response to a shift in the temporal autocorrelation structure of the disturbance regime. Also, species diversity was found to increase at intermediate levels of disturbance (as has been shown in several other studies). However, what can be considered an intermediate level of disturbance depends as much upon the temporal autocorrelation structure of the disturbance regime as it does upon the absolute rate of disturbance. These results suggest that predicting the impact of disturbance on ecological communities will require an explicit understanding of at least some aspects of the spatial and temporal architecture of the disturbance regime.

AB We used the nuclear polyhedrosis virus (LdNPV) of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae), to test one of the basic assumptions of most models of disease dynamics, that the rate of horizontal transmission is directly proportional to the product of the densities of healthy larvae and virus. To do this we made measurements of virus transmission, using small-scale experiments in bags on red oak (Quercus rubra) foliage and field data on naturally occurring populations from a previous study. We observed a decline in the transmission constant as the densities of both healthy larvae and pathogen increased, indicating that the rate of disease transmission is not directly proportional to the product of these variables.

AB Many species exhibit regional synchrony in population dynamics, and different influential biotic and abiotic factors can be indicated by the observed scale of spatial synchrony. Here, we present analyses of spatial patterns of bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus population fluctuations, based on a 5-yr (1990-1994) trapping series obtained from 31 trap stations regularly spaced along a 256-km transect in the boreal forest in southeastern Norway. The bank vole was known to exhibit typically cyclic population dynamics in this region prior to this study.
   Bank vole fall densities exhibited fluctuations with little year-to-year variation; all s-indices (a measure of temporal variability) were below 0.5. There was a large scale trend in the temporal variability of the populations, with highest variability at the south end and lowest in the middle of the transect. Analysis (Mantel correlogram) of the year-to-year rate of change of local populations showed that the opposite ends of the transect appeared to be most out of phase. At a smaller spatial scale (up to 30-40 km), local populations exhibited statistically significant synchrony in growth patterns. Spatiotemporal patterns in the dynamics of local populations were not related to habitat quality. We suggest that the scale domain of population synchrony is related to intrinsic population scaling properties such as dispersal capacity.

AB Increasing attention is being devoted to the dynamics of interacting local populations of species, especially the role of changes in incidence that affect regional persistence. The status of species in a regional context may be determined more by metapopulation dynamics than by purely demographic birth and death processes. The contrast between local and regional views of species' persistence is illustrated today by discussion of the status of amphibians. The amphibian fauna may provide an important indicator of the impact of anthropogenic disturbance to wetland ecosystems. We assessed the status of 11 amphibian species in southwestern Ontario, Canada, by estimating species richness, changes in presence and absence, and incidence at 97 ponds from 1992 to 1994. We detected a significant reduction in amphibian species richness in one of three regions. This loss of diversity relative to the historical species complement is a consequence of the land use history. We observed surprisingly high turnover of species at ponds, with increased incidence varying from 0.07 to 0.29 species per pond per year, and decreased incidence ranging from 0.16 to 0.30 species per pond per year. The incidence of common species across years included both declines (leopard frog, Rana pipiens) and increases (American toad, Bufo americanus). For eight relatively rare species, losses exceeded gains between 1992 and 1993, but this pattern was reversed between 1993 and 1994. Understanding environmental factors that determine the status of species will require an expanded, large-scale view of groups of populations (metapopulations) and their spatial dynamics.

AB As a contribution to enlarging and widening the array of studies available for examination of insect-plant relations, this study contrasts local and regional predictors of species richness and host specificity of leaf-chewing insects feeding on New Guinea trees. I tested the degree to which the variance in local insect variables (species richness, ratio of specialist to generalist chewers, abundance, and biomass) for leaf chewers associated with different species of tropical trees was accounted for by local and regional host-related variables, and by local abundance of potential enemies. Leaf-chewing insects feeding externally on ten species of forest trees were collected over a 1-yr field study in a submontane area in Papua New Guinea. The tree species were taxonomically distant, and the list included species of different successional status, different patterns of leaf production, and different heights. The affinity of chewing insects with particular tree species was ascertained by feeding trials in the laboratory. Local insect species richness varied greatly among tree species, by more than four-fold between the poorest (18 species) and the richest (94 species) tree species. The proportion of specialist insect species associated with particular tree species was significantly different among tree species and ranged from 16 to 72%. Trees supporting a rich fauna usually also supported a high proportion of specialists. The abundance and biomass of leaf-chewing insects per host species was difficult to predict. However, path analyses showed that most of the causal variance in insect species richness and in the ratio of specialist to generalist chewers was accounted for by five properties of the tree species: numbers of young leaves available throughout the year, ant (i.e., enemy) abundance, leaf palatability, leaf water content, and altitudinal range. Most of the variation in local species richness could be predicted from local processes (i.e., food resources and abundance of enemies), not from regional processes. This study and others suggest that in complex environments, such as tropical rain forests, local processes may be comparatively more important in maintaining the local species richness of insect herbivores than in less complex ones, such as temperate woodlands. The implications of these findings are evident: the effects of moderate habitat fragmentation and ecological stress may be more pronounced in tropical systems than in temperate systems and may result in a greater proportional loss of local biodiversity in the former.

AB Predation could be responsible for habitat partitioning by species if different species are safest from predation in different habitats. Alternatively, predation cannot be responsible for habitat partitioning if all species rank the safety of habitats similarly. I developed predictions to test these two hypotheses, using data on the rates at which animals scan the environment for predators while they forage. Preliminary results suggest that predation is unlikely to be responsible for the habitat preferences of sparrow species wintering along an elevational gradient in the Sonoran Desert of southern California, USA.
   Two predictions can be tested using vigilance behavior. (1) If species differ in which habitats they are safest from predation, some species will experience increased risk when moved from one habitat to another, whereas other species will experience decreased risk; changes in vigilance levels between habitats will be inconsistent among species. (2) If species are safest in the same habitat, they will experience similar changes in risk between habitats, and should exhibit similar changes in vigilance levels between habitats.
   Sage Sparrows (Amphispiza belli) and Black-throated Sparrows (A. bilineata) spend the winter in different habitats. I recorded vigilance levels in each habitat while birds foraged on naturally occurring seeds in a portable aviary. Sage Sparrows and Black-throated Sparrows exhibited similar changes in vigilance between habitats, suggesting that these two species are safest in the same habitat, and that predation is unlikely to explain their habitat preferences.
   Also, I tested and found support for the prediction from vigilance theory that food abundance affects vigilance level. Vigilance declined in response to increased foraging patch profitability, counter to the intuitive prediction that increased food abundance relaxes the threat of starvation, allowing more time for vigilance. This relationship between abundance and vigilance is explained by a simple model of starvation.

We examined the fecundity of modules (polyps) and colonies of six reef-building corals (Acropora hyacinthus, A. nana, A. gemmifera, A. millepora, Goninstrea retiformis, and Stylophora pistillata) to explore how modularity influences reproductive strategies and the evolution of life histories in clonal animals. In unitary, aclonal organisms, fecundity often reaches a plateau or declines in old age. In contrast, we found that fecundity of colonies was indeterminate because vegetative growth can lead to an indefinite number of repeated, reproductive modules. However, colony fecundity was not a simple linear function of the number of modules.
   The species ranking of polyp fecundities (G. retiformis > the Acropora species > S. pistillata) was very different from the ranks of size-specific colony fecundities (A. hyacinthus, A. millepora, A. gemmifera > A. nana and G. retiformis). Colony fecundity for small S. pistillata was the lowest of all, but large colonies were more fecund than any of the other species at a comparable colony size (despite Stylophora having the lowest polyp fecundity). This contrast highlights clearly the effects of modularity on the reproductive biology and life histories of clonal organisms.
   The volume of eggs and testes, and the number of eggs and testes per polyp varied greatly among species (20-, 13-, 17-, and 3-fold, respectively). Egg volume was smallest for S. pistillata (the only brooder in the study) and for G. retiformis (which also had the most eggs per polyp, indicating a trade-off between egg size and number). The total reproductive volume per polyp (egg and testes combined) varied three-fold among the six species, and was correlated with a similar range of polyp diameters. In some cases, components of polyp fecundity depended on colony size; egg size in A. hyacinthus and A. nana and the number of planulae per polyp in S. pistillata increased by two- to fourfold with a one to two order of magnitude change in colony size. However, egg size was constant for the other species. Similarly, colony size had no effect on egg or testes number per polyp or testes volume per polyp for any species.
   We also found striking differences in sex allocation, which may relate to the fertilization biology of these hermaphroditic species. The ratio of total egg volume to testes volume per polyp varied fivefold, and was lowest for S. pistillata (a brooder) and G. retiformis (which produced the most and smallest eggs). The ratio increased with colony size for all species, especially A. hyacinthus. An early investment predominantly in testes allows sex to commence without the initial expense of egg production, perhaps so that colony growth can continue to a larger, safer size. All species had a characteristic colony size at maturation, which varied ninefold among taxa, corresponding to a minimum puberty age of 1-3 yr. This is the first comparative study to simultaneously measure male and female function in a range of clonal animals.

AB The interfaces between pifion-juniper canopies and grasslands in the southwestern USA present an opportunity to use the modern theory of spatial phase transitions as a formal characterization of ecotone structure. The theory requires an estimation of a critical value of tree cover at which the woodlands switch abruptly from a fragmented collection of small patches of trees to a network of connected canopies. Presumably, this transition is associated with critical environmental conditions that regulate the ecologies of trees vs. grasses. We developed and tested a new method to estimate the critical cover value of woodlands on complex terrain. The method was based on multiscale assessments of the associations between local tree coverage and two types of patch edge. Tests on artificial gradient percolation maps revealed an interaction between the type of edge used (''hull edge,'' which is based on only the orthogonal connections between canopy-occupied cells, vs. ''accessible edge,'' which is based on both orthogonal and diagonal connections beween canopy-occupied cells) and the neighborhood rule used to define a cluster (von Neumann 5-cell or Moore 9-cell). When applied to digitized, geographically referenced aerial photographs, the method indicated that areas less than or equal to 6.6 ha exhibited the theoretical critical value of 59.3% cover predicted for square lattices and the 5-cell neighborhood. Construction of both edge types on a given map can reveal locations of steep environmental gradients that may be buffered against modest climate fluctuations. The edges can be used in the calibration of independent variables to predict tree cover. The agreement between the expected and observed critical densities will motivate extensions of phase transition theory to studies of ecotones in real landscapes.

AB We conducted two experiments to determine how resources influenced the intraspecific and within-plant allocation by tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum) to the soluble phenolics rutin and chlorogenic acid. We also measured the effect of resource availability on growth by measuring mass and other physical and cellular attributes of the plant, In the first experiment, we subjected plants to four levels of potassium nitrate fertilizer. In the second experiment, we subjected plants to high and low levels of potassium nitrate fertilizer and light, Both experiments yielded results consistent with the growth-differentiation balance hypothesis. Plants grown with low resources showed low levels of soluble phenolics and low plant mass. Plants grown with intermediate levels of resources showed high phenolic concentrations but inhibited growth. Plants grown with high resources had high growth but no increases in phenolic concentrations, The results were also consistent with the general prediction of the optimal defense hypothesis that there should be a negative relationship between growth and defense. We discuss possible adaptive explanations for the specific patterns observed. There were also consistent within-plant differences in phenolic concentrations. These differences in phenolic concentrations were large enough to have potential consequences for insect herbivores feeding on tomato plants.

AB It has been predicted that plants will selectively mature fruit from flowers in which there has been the most intense pollen tube competition. The degree of this selectivity should increase as resources become more constrained and fruit abortion rates increase. One way in which resources could become more constrained is through defoliation by herbivores. The effect of defoliation on selective fruit abortion was tested by examining fruit set and pollen tube numbers in naturally pollinated flowers on defoliated and control branches of Lindera benzoin. Defoliating branches after fruit initiation significantly increased subsequent fruit abortion. Flowers that matured fruit had significantly more pollen tubes per style than those that initiated but then aborted fruit, but greater levels uf pollen competition did not result in the production of larger seeds. On undefoliated control branches, selective abortion occurred only among flowers opening during the second half of the flowering season. On defoliated branches selective abortion occurred throughout the entire flowering season. Although defoliation increased abortion rate, it did not increase selectivity based on pollen tube number. When resources were depleted at the branch level, the position of the flower along the branch influenced whether a flower matured a fruit. Floral phenology was unrelated to position. The influence of position on fruit abortion was likely clue to the patterns of resource acquisition and use.

AB Streams in the plains of eastern Colorado are prone to intense floods following summer thunderstorms. Here, and in other semiarid and arid regions, channel recovery after a flood may take several decades. As a result, flood history strongly influences spatial and temporal variability in bottomland vegetation. Interpretation of these patterns must be based on understanding the long-term response of bottomland morphology and vegetation to specific floods.
   A major flood in 1965 on Plum Creek, a perennial sandbed stream, removed most of the bottomland vegetation and transformed the single-thread stream into a wider, braided channel. Channel narrowing began in 1973 and continues today. In 1991, we determined occurrences of 150 vascular plant species in 341 plots (0.5 m(2)) along a 7-km reach of Plum Creek near Louviers, Colorado. We related patterns of vegetation to elevation, litter cover, vegetative cover, sediment particle size, shade, and year of formation of the underlying surface (based on age of the excavated root flare of the oldest woody plants). Geomorphic investigation determined that Plum Creek fluvial surfaces sort into five groups by year of formation: terraces of fine sand formed before 1965; terraces of coarse sand deposited by the 1965 flood; stable bars formed by channel narrowing during periods of relatively high bed level (1973-1986); stable bars similarly formed during a recent period of low bed level (1987-1990); and the present channel bed (1991).
   Canonical correspondence analysis indicates a strong influence of elevation and litter cover, and lesser effects of vegetative cover, shade, and sediment particle size. However, the sum of all canonical eigenvalues explained by these factors is less than that explained by an analysis including only the dummy variables that define the five geomorphically determined age groups. The effect of age group is significant even when all five other environmental variables are specified as covariables. Therefore, the process of postflood channel narrowing has a dominant influence on vegetation pattern. Channel narrowing at Plum Creek includes a successional process: annual and perennial plants become established on the channel bed, sediment accretes around the vegetation, and increasing litter cover, shade, and scarcity of water eliminate species that are not rhizomatous perennials. However, successional trajectories of individual surfaces are modified by flow-related fluctuations of the bed level; surfaces deposited by the 1965 flood have had distinct sediment and vegetation since their formation. Species richness is highest on surfaces dating to 1987-1990; the many species restricted to this transitory assemblage are perpetuated by flood-related fluctuations in channel width. Since the 1965 flood, seedling establishment of the dominant trees (genus Populus) has occurred only on low surfaces formed during channel narrowing. Thus, the flood has indirectly promoted Populus establishment over a 26-yr period.

AB Most population models incorporate density dependence in a manner that implies the effects of density set in at increasingly higher rates as population densities decrease to zero. For many populations, it may be more plausible to assume chat the effects of density set in at a maximum rate around some characteristic density K > 0: that is, the per capita rate of increase of the population has an inverted sigmoidal farm as a function of population density. In the model discussed here, the rate at which density dependence sets in around K is governed by a parameter gamma, which I refer to as the ''abruptness'' parameter: the larger the parameter gamma, the weaker the effects of density dependence are for population densities below K, the more rapidly density dependence sets in around K, and the more severe the effects of density dependence are beyond K. Results obtained from an Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS) analysis of the abruptness parameter gamma suggest the hypothesis that populations with a density-independent growth rate of <100% from one generation to the next (i.e., a reproductive value of <2) will exhibit a relatively high level of abruptness in their response to density, while the reverse will be true for populations with a density-independent growth rate of >100%. Further, if true, this hypothesis suggests that females with high reproductive tales who deposit young on resources and provide no further maternal care should clump their young to reduce the level of abruptness in density dependence. Also, this hypothesis, together with the fact that high levels of abruptness promote oscillations in populations, implies that we are more likely to observe cyclic and chaotic behavior in relatively slower growing populations than previously thought.

AB Traditional models of nutrient cycling assume that soil microorganisms must decompose organic matter, releasing inorganic N, to make N available to plants. Several lines of evidence have raised doubts about this assumption In arctic tundra, but no firm evidence existed. Here we demonstrate that Eriophorum vaginatum and Carer aquatilis, two tundra sedges, compete well for glycine and aspartate N relative to NH4+ in situ. At relatively high concentrations (25 mu g N/g soil), during the peak of the season, E. vaginatum took up amino acid N more rapidly than NH4+ while later in the season and at lower concentrations (2-4 mu g N/g soil) both E. vaginatum and C. aquatilis took up glycine N and NH4+ at similar rates. These results are incompatible with a simple mechanism of amino acid mineralization followed by plant uptake of the released N. These results indicate that these tundra plants have active mechanisms for enhancing their access to amino acid N in situ.

AB The physical environmental factors (air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed) that define specific microclimates and their effects on water and energy budgets of small birds are of major importance to our understanding oi avian thermal biology. We examined the effects of solar radiation, wind speed, and their interaction on metabolic rates in the Verdin, Auriparus flaviceps. Daytime resting metabolic rates and evaporative water loss rates as a function of air temperature, as well as basal metabolic rate, were also measured to allow estimation of water- and energy Aux rates in diverse microclimates.
   In the absence of solar radiation, as wind speed was increased from 0.4 to 3.0 m/s, metabolic rate increased 14%. Exposure to simulated solar radiation significantly reduced metabolic heal production at all wind speeds measured except 3.0 m/s. Solar heat gain (SHG) was estimated for an irradiance of 1000 W/m(2), similar to that commonly observed in nature. At 0.4 m/s wind speed and 1000 W/m(2) irradiance, SHG may reduce metabolic rate by 46%. SHG declines precipitously as wind speed is increased, and at 3.0 m/s, metabolic rate is only reduced by 3%.
   Analyses of changes changes in thermostatic costs associated with microclimate selection in winter suggest that Verdins may reduce metabolic rare by as much as 50% by shifting from a shaded, windy site to one protected from the wind and exposed to 1000 W/m(2) solar radiation. Similar analyses for Verdins during the summer suggest that microsite selection can result in significant water savings. By remaining our of the sun and wind, Verdins can reduce their rate of evaporative water loss by at least a factor of four, This analysis clearly demonstrates the potential importance of daytime microclimate selection to balancing water and energy budgets in small birds.

AB The form of angiosperm flowers is thought to have evolved in part via selection that excludes ineffective pollinators and increases the efficiency of pollen transfer by effective ones. In previous studies with the montane plant Ipomopsis aggregata, we documented pollinator-mediated selection on several aspects of floral form, including flower width. This character varies continuously within natural populations of I. aggregata, and individuals with wider flowers export more pollen per flower to surrounding plants. We previously showed that this component of phenotypic selection is due primarily to the per-visit effectiveness of hummingbirds, the most important pollinator in our study populations. Here we investigate mechanisms of differential visit effectiveness in greater detail. First, counts of pollen in unvisited flowers showed that pollen production itself increases with width. In aviary experiments, hummingbirds also removed a greater proportion of available pollen as width increased. We next videotaped visits to flowers that varied in width either naturally, or by experimental treatment, and found that hummingbirds inserted their bills more deeply into wider flowers. Finally, we directly manipulated how deeply birds could insert their bills, and found that more pollen was removed after deep insertion. Thus, several mechanisms appear to underlie selection on corolla width via visit effectiveness in pollen export. One involves a phenotypic correlation with pollen production; this underscores the value of experiments for untangling indirect from direct selection. Another mechanism involves direct selection due to the depth of insertion of a hummingbird's bill; this is rare evidence for one form of selection involving the ''fit'' between pollinator and flower.

AB This research provides evidence for chemical mediation in the initiation of gametogenesis and interindividual fine-tuning among populations of the holothurian Cucumaria frondosa. Initiated in the laboratory by increased day length, the gametogenesis of C. frondosa developed normally when individuals were transferred to an environment in which temperature and photoperiod were held constant and food was withheld. Gonad development and spawning of these sea cucumbers occurred simultaneously with animals that were fed. Individuals collected from the deep aphotic zone showed gonadal indices and histological development of gametes synchronous with populations found in the shallower photic zone. These data strongly suggest that day length and temperature were not the sole factors controlling the onset and development of gametogenesis but rather that they act synergistically with other mechanisms. Laboratory experiments showed that gametogenic synchrony was less for individuals separately maintained under natural environmental conditions than it was for similarly treated individuals kept in groups. Finally, gametogenesis was initiated by exposure to more developed individuals, even without the photoperiod cue. This induction, effective only between animals of the same sex, became more evident with increasing maturity of the more developed individuals.

AB It is widely believed that desert annual plants maintain between-year seed banks, yet few field studies actually have measured the proportion of the viable seed bank that remains dormant through a season. Dormancy and germination fractions were quantified for a guild of winter annuals on a creosote flat in the Sonoran Desert for three years. Predictions from two types of theoretical models applicable to temporally variable environments were examined: (1) the evolution of life history traits promoting persistence in the face of temporal variation and (2) the role of temporal variation in mediating species coexistence. The density of ungerminated seeds was estimated by collecting soil samples after germination, but prior to new seed set. Seedlings were followed in nearby plots to estimate the density of germinated seedlings and their reproductive success. Long-term data collected from permanent plots over a 10-yr period were used to calculate temporal variation in reproductive success for each species. Species with higher temporal variation in reproductive success had lower germination fractions and smaller seeds, consistent with the theory that seed dormancy and large seed size are partially substitutable bet-hedging strategies. The data also suggested that this system possesses traits that are necessary for temporal variation to promote coexistence. First, between-year seed banks, necessary to buffer populations in unfavorable years, were documented for 17 species. Second, there was a strong tendency for year-to-year variation in germination fractions to vary among species. Finally, plants germinated more in years of higher reproductive success. We discuss how a correlation between germination and reproductive success enhances the role of temporal variance in success hierarchies in promoting species coexistence.

AB Mixotrophic flagellates can compete with obligately heterotrophic flagellates for the uptake of food particles, whereas mixotrophs and obligately phototrophic phytoplankton can compete for soluble nutrients. Competition for soluble nutrients is expected when photosynthesis covers a significant portion of the mixotrophs' carbon metabolism. When heterotrophy predominates, however, mixotrophs may release soluble nutrients and facilitate phototrophs. Mechanistic resource competition theory predicts that, due to their ability to utilize substitutable C and P sources, mixotrophs should be able to coexist with their more specialized competitors under certain conditions of resource supply.
   In laboratory experiments, the mixotrophic flagellate Ochromonas excluded heterotrophic flagellates when only phototrophic growth was possible. However, Ochromonas was excluded by heterotrophic flagellates when only phagotrophic growth was possible. Both coexisted when food bacteria and light were supplied simultaneously Ochromonas coexisted with a P-limited phytoplankter, Cryptomonas sp, when soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and bacterial phosphorus were available as alternative P sources. In nature, the mixotrophic strategy may be successful when resources are limiting. This is supported by published data on the occurrence of mixotrophic chrysophytes.

ID ANTARCTIC FUR SEALS; KRILL AGGREGATION CHARACTERISTICS; SOUTH GEORGIA;
   DIVING BEHAVIOR; PATTERNS; TIME
AB The pattern of prey distribution can profoundly affect the foraging behavior and success of a predator. In pelagic marine ecosystems, where prey is often patchily distributed, predators must be able to adapt quickly to changes in the spatial patterning of prey. Antarctic fur seals feed primarily on krill, which is patchily distributed. When combined with information about swimming speed on the surface, the time taken for a fur seal to locate a new patch after leaving an old one is an indication of the distance between patches. The frequency distribution of intervals between bouts of foraging showed that fur seals foraged at two spatial distributions: (1) a fine-scale (median distance 0.18-0.27 km) represented by short (<5 min) travel durations between patches; and (2) a coarser or mesoscale (median distance 1.3-1.6 km) represented by longer (>5 min) travel durations. In a study lasting 5 yr, the distributions of travel durations between bouts of feeding changed between years. These changes suggested that the structure and/or the spatial distribution of krill swarms varied between years. The behavior of fur seals suggested that there was overall clumping of prey at the fine-scale, but there was a more even spacing of prey patches at the meso-scale level. Only in 1 yr of the study (1990/1991) were there indications that fur seals had difficulty in finding enough food. Fur seal behavior suggested that there was no reduction in the number of prey patches available in that year but that prey patches were of poorer quality. The study showed how predator behavior can provide valuable information about the functional relationship between prey dispersion and predator performance.

AB Balsam fir (Abies balsamea) is a shade-tolerant conifer that experiences striking growth suppression from browsing of the understory of mixed, boreal-type forests of Isle Royale, Michigan, where it forms an important component of moose (Alces alces) diet in winter. Suppression increases with increasing canopy cover and forest age. However, response to an individual, severe browsing episode cannot be generalized in terms of suppression. Such shorter-term responses are best investigated by experimentation.
   Artificial removal of foliage from understory balsam fir in two sites on Isle Royale and one mainland site showed that damage such as reduced terminal growth and complete mortality was actually highest among least suppressed trees. Canopy cover produced a secondary effect, in which trees experiencing >60% cover were unable to compensate for removal by clipping. Among less suppressed trees, competition for limited light produced an apically oriented morphology that countered the laterally oriented morphology associated with suppression. Higher vulnerability to the artificial browsing occurred because trees were no longer protected by snow cover. By the second growing season following clipping, surviving clipped trees even in the most damaged sites resumed the same growth as controls. Over the long term, suppression may be a means by which fir remains alive when subjected to continuous browsing. Over the shorter term, delayed growth recovery following severe browsing in an unsuppressed understory may also contribute to sustainability in Isle Royale's plant-herbivore system.

AB Few experimental studies have documented the negative effect of parasites on fitness of hosts under natural or seminatural conditions. We studied the effect of Ei,nel-ia arizonensis (Protozoa) on recruitment, winter survival, and change in body mass in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). In field observations, the presence of E. arizonensis was negatively related to recruitment in females and to over-winter survival in males. Experimental manipulation of E. arizonensis in large field enclosures also showed that infection negatively affected over-winter survival of males, There was no relationship between the body mass of deer mice and the presence of either natural or experimental infection. Thus, the mechanism through which E. arizonensis affects survival remains unclear.

AB We manipulated, in accord with global-warming predictions, the thermal regime of a permanent first-order stream near Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We examined the effects of a 2-3.5 degrees C water-temperature increase on densities, biomass, species composition, and life histories of resident stream invertebrates. The stream was divided longitudinally at the source into two channels, one control and one experimental, and a before and after (BACI) design was employed such that one pre-manipulation year was followed by 2 yr of the temperature manipulation. Changes in the experimental channel following commencement of the manipulation included: (1) decreased total animal densities, particularly Chironomidae (Diptera); (2) earlier onset of adult insect emergence; (3) increased growth rates and precocious breeding in Hyalella azteca (Amphipoda); (4) smaller size at maturity for Nemoura trispinosa (Plecoptera) and H. azteca; and (5) altered sex ratios for Lepidostoma vernale (Trichoptera). These results partially corroborate previous laboratory and field studies. However, variation in the responses of individual target species to the manipulation was unexpected and may have been influenced by the genetic structure of local populations. We conclude that levels of gene flow among habitats may be critical to the degree of impact seen as a result of large-scale thermal perturbation (e.g., global warming).

AB We conducted field and laboratory experiments to examine the relative contributions of mortality from natural enemies and cannibalism to population regulation of the wolf spider Schizocosa ocreata. This cursorial spider is a common generalist predator in the leaf litter of forests of the eastern United States. In our study site in Maryland, densities of recently dispersed young S. ocreata can reach 60-90 individuals/m(2), but decline to <15 spiders/m(2) by early autumn. We investigated the cause of this rapid decline in spiderling density.
   We first performed a predator-exclusion field experiment to determine if natural enemies contributed significantly to spider mortality. Replicated enclosures with lip barriers to prevent emigration were stocked with newly dispersed S. ocreata spiderlings at either 0.75x or 3x mean field density, or had no S. ocreata added (0x). Before spiderlings were introduced, we reduced potential enemies in half of the plots by sifting the litter and removing other spiders, centipedes and predaceous beetles, and by installing 3-mm mesh netting to exclude birds, wasps and other predators of S. ocreata. Over a period of 2.5 mo we measured effects of natural enemies and spider density on prey (Collembola), spider growth, and spider survival. Spider mortality was high (approximate to 80%) and strongly density dependent (DD). Survival in the 3x field-density plots was 50% lower than in the 0.75x plots. Increasing spiderling density did not significantly reduce Collembola density and resulted only in a minor DD reduction in spiderling growth (approximate to 10%). Although overall spider mortality was high, excluding natural enemies did not significantly improve spider survival. The absence of emigration and the high spider mortality rates in the predator-reduction treatment strongly implicate cannibalism as the major DD mortality factor.
   We then conducted two laboratory experiments in order to obtain direct measurements of the rates of cannibalism. Rates of cannibalism were measured in 0.3-m(2) arenas stocked with S. ocreata at densities equivalent to those used in the field experiment. In Experiment 1, habitat complexity and prey availability were manipulated in arenas stocked with S. ocreata at 3x mean held densities. In Experiment 2, we manipulated spider density (0.75x and 3x) and prey density to evaluate the DD component of cannibalism. The laboratory experiments confirmed the importance of cannibalism as a DD mortality factor. DD mortality from cannibalism was influenced by both prey abundance and habitat complexity. The presence of prey significantly reduced rates of cannibalism, and there was a significant interaction between habitat complexity and prey availability. When prey were present, rates of cannibalism were higher in the complex habitat than the simple habitat. In the absence of prey, increasing habitat complexity had no effect on rates of cannibalism. Rates of cannibalism in the treatment that most closely mimicked field conditions-complex leaf-litter with prey at natural densities-did not differ significantly from the rate of mortality of S. ocreata in the field experiment. Considered together, the results of our field and laboratory experiments lead to the conclusion that cannibalism can act as a strong DD mortality factor for young instars of S. ocreata, with the potential to regulate densities of this abundant cursorial spider.

AB The bush cricket, Metrioptera bicolor Philippi (Orthoptera, Tettigoniidae) lives in a restricted area with grassland patches separated by mainly pine forest. The regional population dynamics can be described as a metapopulation with local extinctions and colonizations. I used inventory data in order to test the following hypotheses: (1) temporal variability of local population size should be negatively correlated with habitat heterogeneity, when habitat quality changes in relation to fluctuating weather conditions; (2) extinction risk should be higher on homogeneous habitat patches than on heterogeneous patches. Both hypotheses are convincingly corroborated and I find a compensatory effect between patch area and heterogeneity. Local extinctions may occur on large, but homogeneous patches, and local populations can survive quite well on small patches that contain a mosaic of several types of grassland vegetation with different humid conditions. I discuss the implications of these findings for the preservation of endangered species that are susceptible to regional stochasticity.

AB Watercress (Nasturtium officinale) is a spring-stream macrophyte that possesses glucosinolates, which are hydrolyzed to feeding deterrent isothiocyanates when the enzyme myrosinase is released by tissue damage. Previous studies indicated that frequently associated aquatic shredders strongly prefer yellowed-senescent leaves over fresh-green foliage, because the latter releases much more isothiocyanate than senescent watercress. When the action of myrosinase was blocked by heating the tissue, the shredders' preference shifted to heated-green tissue, which contains much more nitrogen than that found in senescent tissue.
   Here we report a series of no-choice experiments oil various tissue types designed to determine intermediate and long-term consumption rates and associated impacts on growth and survival of shredders associated with watercress. The amphipod Gammarus pseudolimnaeus, the caddisflies Pycnopsyche sp., Hesperophylax designatus, and Limnephilus sp., and the snail PHysella gyrina, all consumed much more senescent than fresh-green tissue. In long-term tests with G. pseudolimnaeus, H. designatus, and Limnephilus sp., growth was negative or zero on the defended fresh-green tissue and often highest on heated-green tissue. Reaction to glucosinolates differed among shredders. For the caddisflies, growth and survival were positively correlated with bulk tissue and nitrogen consumption, which were highest for heated-green tissue. However, amphipod survival was significantly lowered on heated-green watercress, although it was readily consumed. Therefore, consumption of high-glucosinolate tissue was detrimental to the amphipods but not to caddisflies.
   Our results indicate that the glucosinolate-myrosinase system defends live green watercress against herbivory by an array of aquatic invertebrates. These generalist herbivores forgo eating high-quality fresh-green leaves because of plant defenses and instead settle fur lower quality senescent leaves. When the defense system was experimentally shut down, these herbivores readily consumed young green tissue and frequently showed higher growth rates than those achieved on the senescent, but undefended, leaves they typically consume. Evidently, these shredders face a trade-off of high nitrogen and high defense vs. low nitrogen and low defense.

AB Body temperatures, heat exchange rates, behavioral thermoregulation, and movement behavior (as an index of foraging mode) were studied in two widely distributed, medium-sized lacertid lizards (Acanthodactylus erythrurus and Psammodromus algirus). P. algirus mainly inhabits broad-leaved forests, whereas A. erythrurus prefers open, sandy areas with sparsely distributed vegetation. These habitat preferences parallel differences between the areas in which both genera presumably originated: Eurosaharian xeric steppes with high operative temperatures (T-e) for Acanthodactylus, and Mediterranean open forests with lower T-e for Psammodromus.
   Field observations showed that percentage of time spent basking and basking rate (number of basks per minute) were negatively related to T-e, although average bask duration was not. Percentage of time spent moving, moving rate (number of moves per minute), and the average duration of individual moves were inversely related to T-e and were higher in P. algirus. The percentage of total locomotion time that was spent moving in the shade was also higher in P. algirus. Behavioral thermoregulation strategies differed in a laboratory thermogradient, where P. algirus basked more often and for shorter periods and selected warmer patches than did A. erythrurus. Selected body temperatures (T-b) in a laboratory thermogradient were significantly higher in A. erythrurus than in P. algirus. Shade Seeking T-b was higher in A. erythrurus, but Resume Basking T-b did not differ significantly between the two species. Heating and cooling rates also differed in the two species: A. erythrurus warmed more slowly and cooled faster than did P. algirus.
   Our data support the existence of a complex syndrome that combines aspects of the behavior, physiology, and ecology of both species. The thermal consequences of inhabiting a certain type of habitat can be counterbalanced by behavioral and physiological means that, in turn, affect movement and, hence, foraging behavior. Thus, the more active species (P. algirus) heated faster, cooled more slowly, and basked more often but for shorter periods and at warmer patches than the less active species (A. erythrurus).

AB Temperature and food quality are well known to constrain the growth of insect herbivores, but less is known about how these factors may interact. We examined the effects of three tomato allelochemicals (chlorogenic acid, rutin, and tomatine) and two thermal regimes (21 degrees:10 degrees C and 26 degrees:15 degrees C, representing spring and summer respectively) on three insect herbivores: a Solanaceae specialist, Manduca sexta, and the polyphagous Helicoverpa zea and Spodoptera exigua.
   The alkaloid tomatine slowed development of the polyphagous N. tea, but the two phenolics had little effect. Development of the polyphagous S. exigua was faster with tomatine at the cool thermal regime, and slower with the two phenolics together at the warm thermal regime. All three of the tomato allelochemicals slowed development of the specialist M. sexta.
   Values of approximate digestibility (or assimilation efficiency) for the two polyphagous species spanned a range twice that of the Solanaceae specialist, increasing when allelochemicals were added to diet. Our techniques permitted us to separate pre- and post-ingestive effects of allelochemicals on mass gained, but we found complex interaction of allelochemicals and of temperature and allelochemicals.
   The effects of an allelochemical on larval performance often depended on the combination of other allelochemicals in the diet. But the allelochemicals did not always have a negative effect, and multiple allelochemicals did not always have a more negative effect than a single allelochemical.
   Interaction between thermal regime and the allelochemicals was also common. For example, whether rutin had a negative, neutral, or positive effect on relative growth rare of S. exigua depended on thermal regime and presence or absence of chlorogenic acid. Often the negative effect of an allelochemical was greater at the warm regime than at the cool regime, but not consistently so.
   Another experiment showed that thermal regime did not affect allelochemical concentration in the diets. Over time (7 d), only tomatine concentration declined. Therefore, the interactive effects of thermal regime and allelochemicals on the insect herbivores were not an artifact of the experimental procedures.
   Overall, the results indicated that insect performance is not a simple function of temperature and food quality because interactions occur between these factors. They also suggest that the array of chemical defenses exhibited by a particular plant species may be shaped in part by temperature altering the efficacy of allelochemicals.

AB Field manipulations of light, temperature, nutrients, and length of growing season in directions simulating global environmental change altered biomass of the four most abundant vascular plant species in tussock tundra of northern Alaska. These species are Betula nana, Ledum palustre, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, and Eriophorum vaginatum. Biomass response to our treatments reflected changes in both growth and mortality, with growth being stimulated by treatments that enhanced biomass, and mortality being enhanced by all treatments (except in Vaccinium). Those species with highest leaf and stem turnover (the graminoid and deciduous shrub) initially showed large positive responses to nutrient addition. By contrast, slow-turnover evergreen species showed little initial change in production in response to our manipulations, and their long-term biomass responses were in the opposite direction to those of the responsive species. Short-term measurements of leaf expansion, photosynthesis, and phosphate uptake showed little correlation with net production or biomass change in response to manipulations because of compensatory mechanisms at levels of growth and allocation. Changes in nutrient distribution among species accounted for many of the long-term changes in biomass and productivity. Processes that are readily integrated at annual time steps (e.g., shoot growth, shoot mortality, allocation) were more useful than instantaneous physiological measurements in predicting decadal vegetation changes because (1) compensating responses among physiological processes buffer plant responses at progressively longer time scales, (2) species interactions in the community buffer ecosystem processes such as productivity and nutrient cycling from changes in growth of individual species, and (3) different time lags between physiological, demographic, and ecosystem processes complicate modeling of long-term responses from short-term mechanisms.

AB Although there are many studies of wind dispersal of seeds from a forest into an adjacent clearing, no physical model has yet been advanced. The model constructed here calculates the trajectories of seeds from individual trees in the area source to a line of seed traps (in the clearing) oriented perpendicular to the forest edge. The model uses a log-normal distribution of horizontal wind velocities at a nearby reference station to evaluate wind velocities at any point in the forest and clearing as a function of both height above the ground and distance from the forest edge. The model predicts that (1) the slope of the area source dispersal curve (seed density vs. leeward distance) approximates a negative exponential; and (2) the great majority of seed deposition in the clearing is contributed by source trees lying within a few tree heights of the forest edge. An evaluation of previously published empirical data shows that the area source model adequately characterizes the decline in seed density with leeward distance.

AB Many crustaceans have complex life cycles characterized by a metamorphosis, yet variation in metamorphic traits, and the causes and consequences of this variation, have rarely been examined. Food concentrations were changed during specific larval stages of the freshwater copepod Mesocyclops edax Forbes (Copepoda: Cyclopoida) to examine whether age and size at metamorphosis remain flexible or become fixed during the larval period. Results were compared to predictions of both flexible (the Wilbur-Collins model) and fixed (Leips-Travis model) rate models for the timing of amphibian metamorphosis. Age and size at metamorphosis were variable in all treatments, and age was always more variable than size. Changes in food concentration early in larval development resulted in significant differences in age at metamorphosis among treatments, but changes initiated when 60% of the larval period had passed had no effect on age at metamorphosis. Development appeared to become fixed later in the larval period, before the ultimate larval stage was reached. These results support predictions of the Leips-Travis model. Early changes in food concentrations had significant effects on size at metamorphosis, but changes initiated during the penultimate larval stage (50-60% of larval development) had no effect on metamorph size. Size at metamorphosis in M. edax also appeared to be fixed before the ultimate larval stage was reached. Fixation of size at metamorphosis during development is not predicted by either model and may be unique to organisms with rigid exoskeletons that constrain growth within any stage. Patterns of covariation between age and size at metamorphosis suggest that food conditions early in larval development exert a large effect on metamorphic traits, in contrast to patterns observed in several amphibian species.
   The Wilbur-Collins model places a fitness premium on delaying metamorphosis to achieve a maximum size, when growth conditions are favorable; it thus may not apply to crustaceans. Selection pressures on the timing of metamorphosis in crustaceans may differ substantially from those identified for amphibians and other organisms. Because of these differences, incorporating crustaceans into studies of metamorphosis will help to clarify the factors affecting this life cycle transition.

AB Emergent wetland plants often alleviate the effects of anaerobic soils on root respiration by passively transporting oxygen belowground through continuous air spaces (aerenchyma) in leaves and roots. Oxygen leaked from the roots into the rhizosphere may oxidize minerals in the soil or become available to other plants. Some spatial patterns in marsh plant communities suggest interspecific facilitative interactions, but there is little experimental evidence for interplant facilitation via soil oxygenation. We investigated the capability of the widespread, highly aerenchymous wetland plant, Typha latifolia, to aerate sediments and affect the growth of two non-aerenchymous neighbors, Salix exigua and Myosotis laxa, both in greenhouse experiments and in a natural pothole pond in western Montana. At soil temperatures of 11 degrees-12 degrees C in the greenhouse, mean dissolved oxygen (DO) ranged from 2.75+/-0.41 to 4.43+/-1.11 mg/L (mean +/- 1 SE) in pots with Typha, whereas in pots without Typha DO content ranged from 0.40+/-0.06 to 0.65+/-0.06 mg/L. At soil temperatures of 18 degrees-20 degrees C, DO in the Typha treatment was lower than in the low-temperature experiment and did not differ significantly from DO in the pots without Typha. At substrate temperatures of 11 degrees-12 degrees C, all rooted Salix cuttings survived when planted with Typha, whereas none survived when planted alone. At the same substrate temperature, Myosotis transplants grew significantly larger when planted with Typha than when alone, also indicating that facilitation occurred. When grown with Typha at soil temperatures of 18 degrees-20 degrees C, however, Myosotis root mass was significantly less than when grown alone, suggesting that competition occurred. At the pond margins where Typha and Myosotis coexist in water-saturated soils, naturally occurring Myosotis plants adjacent to transplanted Typha had significantly larger shoot and fruit mass than did control Myosotis without nearby Typha. In this experiment DO levels in soil water and available soil nitrogen did not differ among treatments. These experiments indicate that aerenchymous wetland plants have the potential to facilitate neighbors via soil oxygenation, and that facilitation and competition may shift in importance with changes in the physical environment.

AB The impact of disease on plant populations may change as a result of coevolutionary interactions. The Red Queen hypothesis suggests that parasites provide a selective advantage to host sexual recombination sufficient to explain its persistence despite the twofold advantage of asexual reproduction. The constant production of resistant host genotypes by sexual recombination favors parasite genotypes that can overcome host resistance, resulting in a coevolutionary ''arms race.'' Systemic fungal parasites differ from nonsystemic fungi in ways that affect plant-pathogen interactions. Many systemic fungal parasites castrate their host plants, which reduces the potential for production of genetically variable, resistant progeny. Moreover, host genotypes susceptible to infection by the maternal pathogen are perpetuated through parasite-induced asexual reproduction or enforced selfing. Grasses in the genus Danthonia infected by Atkinsonella hypoxylon represent a model system for investigating evolution and stasis in plant-pathogen associations. Infected plants, unlike uninfected plants, reproduce only by self-fertilized seed through which the fungus is vertically transmitted. Other similar associations exist, suggesting that parasites can often enforce genetic uniformity within host populations.

AB Annual records of charcoal and sedimentation rate were compared with fossil pollen to investigate the role of fire in eastern deciduous forest around Devil's Bathtub, New York, USA. Changes in peak and background charcoal suggest that changes in fire have accompanied the principal vegetation and climatic changes of the last 10 400 yr. A distribution of return times (50-200-yr intervals) similar to parts of modern boreal Canada prevailed when late-Glacial spruce woodland dominated the site. Expansion of Pinus banksiana appears to have altered the fire regime to one of crown fires with high particulate emissions, but return intervals similar to those of the preceding Picea forest. Expansion of Pinus strobus might be linked to change in fire occurrence, but the broad dispersal of Pinus pollen makes interpretation difficult. If Pinus strobus expansion around the site is reflected in its pollen curve, then that expansion coincides with a time of frequent fire. Alternatively, if increasing pollen abundance precedes the local expansion of trees, as has been observed elsewhere, then local expansion might correspond to an abrupt decline in fire frequency and in regional importance of fire. An abrupt decline in background charcoal follows a fire and coincides (+/-100 yr) with the expansion of hardwood taxa such as Fagus. The decline in background charcoal occurs over several years, suggesting that it may be linked to effects of hardwood expansion on fuels. Fires do not appear to have occurred during the time of hardwood dominance, suggesting that lire may not be an explanation for maintenance of species diversity in this deciduous forest. However, frequent occurrence of thick varves during the latter half of the Holocene suggests that the frequency of other types of disturbance may have increased.

AB We tested the hypothesis that a bitrophic (third and fourth level) arthropod predator can exert a cascading, top-down influence on other arthropods and plants in an early successional old field. First-stadium mantids, Tenodera sinensis, were added to replicated open-field plots in numbers corresponding to naturally occurring egg hatch density and allowed to remain for approximate to 2 mo. Sticky-trap dispersal barriers around both control and mantid-addition plots allowed us to monitor emigration of arthropods continuously during the experiment. Biomass of herbivores, carnivores, and plants, and abundances of arthropod taxa within plots were determined at the beginning, middle, and end of the experiment.
   The impact of mantids on the community was a top-down trophic cascade, beginning at the fourth trophic level and evident at each of the lower three levels. Mantids induced marked behavioral responses in other predators, but interference among predators did not prevent the trophic cascade. The most common predators, cursorial spiders, emigrated from mantid addition plots in significantly greater numbers than from controls. This behavioral response may have resulted from avoidance of predation or competition.
   Mantids decreased biomass of herbivorous arthropods through predation, and this decrease in turn increased biomass of plants. Therefore, these generalist predators were able to decrease herbivory enough to affect plant growth. This and other recent studies indicate that top-down effects can be important in structuring terrestrial communities. Ours is the first example of a top-down cascade by a generalist arthropod predator in a nonagricultural ecosystem and illustrates the importance of detecting behavioral responses in studies of trophic interactions.

AB Surveys such as the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) produce large collections of parameter estimates. One's natural inclination when confronted with lists of parameter estimates is to look for the extreme values: in the BBS, these correspond to the species that appear to have the greatest changes in population size through time. Unfortunately, extreme estimates are liable to correspond to the most poorly estimated parameters. Consequently, the most extreme parameters may not match up with the most extreme parameter estimates.
   The ranking of parameter values on the basis of their estimates is a difficult statistical problem. We use data on 401 species from the BBS and simulations to illustrate the potential misleading effects of sampling variation in rankings of parameters. We describe empirical Bayes and constrained empirical Bayes procedures that provide partial solutions to the problem of ranking in the presence of sampling variation.

AB Numerous insects, including Drosophila nigrospiracula, that inhabit necrotic cacti of the Sonoran desert are host to Macrocheles subbadius, a cosmopolitan mesostigmatid mite. This paper shows that the mite pierces Drosophila integument and ingests haemolymph while attached to the abdomen of its host. Among field-caught flies, there was a strong negative relationship between mite load and wet mass of adult flies of both sexes. Thus, M. subbadius is an ectoparasite of D. nigrospiracula, contrary to the widespread belief that macrochelids form only phoretic associations with adult flies. The parasite harms its host in many ways. Under laboratory conditions, there was a significant negative effect of mite load on survivorship. In the field, there was a significant negative relationship between mite load and number of eggs carried by sexually mature females, suggesting that infested females resorb their oocytes to compensate for nutritional stress imposed by feeding mites. Likewise, in the laboratory, infestation lengthened somewhat the period prior to onset of oviposition, and decreased the number of eggs laid by females over their life. However, mite-infested females maintained on a yeast-supplemented diet overcame the potentially debilitating effects of mites, and were actually slightly, but not significantly, more fertile than uninfested females. Since the dietary conditions of flies influenced the degree to which fecundity was affected, the debilitating effect of mites is comparable to that of starvation. This conclusion derives support from the observation that laboratory females infested for 4 d, but whose mites were subsequently removed, produced fewer progeny than uninfested females. Although this effect was significant only among old females, it nevertheless indicates that the observed effects of mites on fecundity are not the result of mechanical constraints on oviposition behavior. Since intensities of infestation used in laboratory experiments were similar to those encountered in nature, observed ectoparasitic effects on fly fitness suggest that M. subbadius can reduce fly numbers in nature.

AB In many predator-prey systems, prey individuals make transitions between vulnerable and invulnerable states or locations. The invulnerable (or less vulnerable) class can be individuals occupying a spatial refuge or those engaged in activities that greatly reduce the risk of predation. Simple models are used to show that transitions between such classes have the following consequences: (1) equilibrium prey density increases as the conditions of prey growth are improved and (2) enrichment often cannot destabilize systems with stable equilibrium densities and may stabilize systems that are undergoing limit cycle oscillations. Transitions to and from invulnerable states therefore represent a possible explanation for the lack of examples of destabilization via fertilization (''the paradox of enrichment'') in nature. Other theoretical reasons for the apparent absence of the paradox of enrichment are reviewed, and methods of distinguishing the different mechanisms are discussed.

AB The effects of habitat destruction and fragmentation on survival rate and population size were tested in an experimental model system consisting of seven enclosed populations of root voles, Microtus oeconomus. The study comprised two consecutive parts. First, the effect of habitat fragmentation was investigated by comparing survival in three populations inhabiting continuous habitat with that in four populations inhabiting fragmented habitat. Second, the continuous habitats were experimentally fragmented by destroying 50% of the area inhabited by the populations, producing the same configuration as in the fragmented habitats. These extensive habitat manipulations were expected to affect survival rates due to changes in the spatiosocial structuring of the populations. Throughout the study, populations were monitored by an intensive live-trapping program. Cormack-Jolly-Seber methodology was used for statistical modelling and estimation of survival rates.
   The seven experimental populations differed considerably in population dynamics: some grew, while others remained remarkably stable throughout the experiment. In contrast to expectations, neither population size nor survival rates seemed to be affected by the experimental treatments. Survival rate seemed to play a minor role in determining population size. Emigration rates, which also seemed to have little direct demographic importance, were considerably higher in fragmented than in continuous habitats during the first (pre-destruction) part of the study. Surprisingly, this difference persisted after habitat destruction, when all populations experienced the same habitat configuration.
   We conclude that survival rates in these root vole populations were not dependent on major alterations of spatiosocial structure, possibly owing to adaptation to natural disturbance regimes.

AB I used a combination of insect removal experiments and extensive censuses to estimate how the herbivore pressure on a native goldenrod, Solidago altissima, varied over a period of 6 yr. The pyrethroid insecticide, fenvalerate, was applied to experimental plots in an old field near Ithaca, New York, on staggered schedules so as to produce sets of plants that had experienced different levels of herbivory over different combinatons of years. By comparing the performance of plants in the different treatments, I was able to measure both the contemporaneous and cumulative effects of insect herbivores on the growth and flowering of goldenrods. This protocol also provided the basis for estimating herbivore pressure (defined as the loss in plant performance that is associated with the presence of herbivores) by two independent procedures, the ''experimental suppression'' approach and the ''correlation with herbivore load'' approach, which served as checks on various potential sources of error. I have taken this opportunity to illustrate the pitfalls and advantages of the two approaches within the context of a concrete example.
   The experiment demonstrated that goldenrods order their response to herbivory so as to favor maintenance of established individuals over seed production; both the proportion of stems that bloomed and the size of individual inflorescences were reduced during years when herbivore loads were too low to produce a measurable impact on the length and density of stems. Herbivore loads never reached levels sufficient to have detectable effects that carried over to influence plant performance in the following year. In addition, there was no evidence that insects were attracted to lush plants that had escaped herbivore attack the previous year. Relatively small loads, however, had effects that accumulated slowly over a period of years. Interestingly, ramets exhibited a different ordering in their response to the contemporaneous and cumulative effects of herbivory; the mass of inflorescences, the plant attribute that was most sensitive to contemporaneous herbivory, never responded to the effects of herbivory that accumulated over the 6 yr of the experiment.
   The experiment provided a means for inferring the impact of the herbivore loads that were obtained from censuses of 22 different goldenrod stands over the 6-yr period. These results show that goldenrod stands in central Neu York can be expected to experience relatively low herbivore loads (<50 mg of herbivore dry mass per metre of stem) over 75% of the time. At these chronic levels herbivores cause a moderate reduction in the production of flowers but exert no measurable influence on stem growth. infrequently (on the order of 5% of the time), herbivore loads can be expected to exceed 200 mg per metre of stem. At such loads herbivores can completely inhibit flowering and severely stunt vegetative growth. Such damaging loads are caused by population outbreaks of a few dominant insect species whose numbers usually wane before their cumulative impact threatens the goldenrod's persistence in the community. The herbivore pressures measured herein appear sufficient to act as potent agents for selecting between goldenrod genotypes.

AB According to life history theory, adult mortality during the breeding season may have an important influence on the evolution of several aspects of breeding ecology in birds, yet few studies have tried to quantify such mortality. We studied disappearance of Pied Flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) during four breeding seasons in a woodland area in Norway provided with nest boxes. The main cause of disappearance was probably predation by the European Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus). Disappearance was nonsignificantly higher in females (10% per season, n = 305) than in males (7% per season, n = 269). Female disappearance peaked during egg-laying (0.53% per day), but was also high during the nest-building (0.42% per day) and nestling (0.36% per day) stages. It was low during incubation (0.05% per day), probably because less time was spent outside the nest. Low risk of predation during incubation may help to explain why female body mass remains high during this stage of breeding but drops soon after hatching. Females with selected flight feathers experimentally removed to simulate molt suffered a much higher disappearance per season (24%, n = 109) than did control females (10%, n = 305). This may help to explain why breeding and molt usually are temporally segregated activities in birds. Variation in female body mass and size (wing length, tarsus length), age, previous breeding experience, mating date, laying date, clutch size, and mating status could not account for the variation found in female disappearance. Disappearance was lower in males than in females during the nest-building period, despite the more conspicuous plumage color of males. This may be explained by the fact that only the female builds the nest. We suggest that risk of predation is an important constraint on sexual selection of male plumage color in species in which males take part in nest building.

AB This study examines the non-lethal effects of an odonate predator (Anax junius) on the competitive interactions among several size classes of anuran larvae, In an outdoor experiment using cattle watering tanks, we estimated the effects of both large and small bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) on themselves, on each other, and on small green frogs (R. clamitans) in the absence and non-lethal (caged) presence of Anax. The presence of Anax depressed both growth and survivorship of small bullfrogs and green frogs. In contrast, the presence of Anax had positive effects on growth rates and size at metamorphosis of the large bullfrogs. Increasing density of competitors also decreased survivorship of small classes, and growth rates of all classes. The per-unit-biomass competitive effects of the small bullfrogs on target classes were much greater than those of large bullfrogs. The presence of Anax significantly altered the per-unit-biomass competitive effects of small bullfrogs but not large bullfrogs, presumably because individuals in the small class reduced their activity rates in the presence of Anax. Overall production of new tadpole biomass was quite similar across experimental units, with decreases in production of small size classes in the presence of Anax compensated for by increases in production of the large size class. Thus the non-lethal presence of Anax had substantial effects on the nature of competitive interactions in this system, and we discuss the implications of such behavioral indirect effects in the study of ecological communities; Our results also illustrate the futility of attempting to partition the effects of competitors and predators, as both competitors and the non-lethal presence of predators significantly affected growth rates and death by starvation of small larvae. Finally, our results illustrate how individual behavioral responses may be translated to community and ecosystem properties.

AB An important ecological issue is developing an understanding of how patterns and processes vary with scale. We designed a field experiment to test how differences in the aerial extent of disturbance affected macrofaunal recolonization on a sandflat. Three different plot sizes (0.203 m(2), 0.81 m(2), and 3.24 m(2)) were defaunated, and samples were collected to assess recovery over a 9-mo period. As the sandflat used for the experiment was prone to disturbance by wind-driven waves, we also measured changes in sediment bed height (an indicator of sediment stability) over the course of the experiment. Most common species revealed significant relationships between density and disturbance plot size. Scale-dependent recovery was also demonstrated by differences in species assemblage structure over the course of the experiment. Relative rates of colonization varied by approximate to 50% between large and small experimental plots. However, these differences were not related to specific species, particular functional groups, or potential modes or colonization. The results revealed an unusually slow rate of faunal recovery following defaunation. Both increasing numbers of colonists and density changes in ambient sediments made an important contribution to recovery. The relationship found between changes in sediment bed height and wind velocity indicated that wind-driven wave disturbance was an important factor influencing sediment instability. Sediment instability was higher in all experimental plots than in the ambient sediments, due to the initial removal of a dense spionid polychaete tube mat characteristically found at the study site. Sediment instability also increased with increasing plot size. Thus in this dynamic sandflat habitat, faunal emigration from recovering disturbed patches of sediment may significantly slow rates of recolonization. These results demonstrate that incorporating patch size, emigration, recovery time, and interactions between hydrodynamic conditions and habitat ability (particularly where colonists influence sediment stability) are crucial to generating a general understanding of recovery processes in soft-sediment habitats. While our results demonstrate the need for caution in scaling-up from small-scale studies, they do indicate that larger scale disturbances that destroy organisms with a role in maintaining habitat stability are likely to result in very slow recovery dynamics, particularly in wave-disturbed sofi-sediment habitats.

AB Although mutualisms are often viewed as fragile constructs, subject to invasion by ''cheaters'' that gain from the mutualism without providing compensating benefits, few studies have explored whether or not apparent cheating behavior by one player actually denies benefits to the other species. Panicled bluebells (Mertensia paniculata) experience high rates of nectar robbery by bumble bees (Bombus mixtus and B. frigidus) in the Wrangell Mountains of southcentral Alaska. Nevertheless, experimental prevention of nectar larceny in two seasons did not enhance components of female reproductive success (nutlet initiation, seed-set, and seed mass) or male success (pollen removal). Observational data show that the absence of a negative impact of nectar robbery is a consequence of bumble bee behaviors; the two bee species that rob mature flowers buzz-pollinate the same flowers at an earlier stage in floral development. The shift in bee behavior is driven by the presentation of different rewards at different times in the flowering period; young flowers contain pollen and older flowers produce nectar. Although flowers typically receive and donate pollen before most nectar is produced, the mature flowers producing a robbed nectar reward may nonetheless contribute to the reproductive success of bluebell plants. Flowers sequestered from pollinators in the early stage were still capable of initiating nutlets, demonstrating that older flowers can enhance female reproduction if pollinators are rare (when many early-stage flowers may go unvisited). Moreover, the removal of mature flowers reduced the visitation rate to early-stage flowers on the same plant. Because individual bumble bees switch frequently between nectar robbing and pollen collection, the nectar reward in mature flowers may act as a key enticement to pollinators, which then enhance plant reproduction by legitimately visiting early-stage flowers. Rather than representing a case of cheating behavior, nectar robbery may be an integral part of this plant-pollinator mutualism.

AB The prevailing notion that interspecific competition has little impact on the abundances of tropica!reef fishes has been tested by few experiments, all of which examined its effects on recruitment and juvenile demography rather than on adult abundances. This study, in Caribbean Panama, examined whether a common territorial damselfish, Stegastes planifrons, limits the abundances of adults of four ecologically similar congeners in S. planifrons' primary habitat: S. partitus and S. variabilis, which commonly occur in that habitat, and S. diencaeus and S. leucostictus, which rarely do.
   When S. planifrons was nearly eliminated from 16 natural patch reefs for 4-6 yr, adult populations of S. partitus, which is less aggressive and half the size of S. planifrons, doubled and expanded their range into a microhabitat previously used almost exclusively by adults of S. planifrons. Population increases by S. partitus occurred within 1 yr of the removal of S. planifrons, were persistent, but only reached their maximum approximate to 4 yr (and about four generations) after the initial removal. Adult populations of S. variabilis, which is less aggressive and 20% smaller than S. planifrons, also doubled following the removal of S. planifrons. Combined populations of S. partitus plus S. variabilis increased most on reefs where S. planifrons previously had been most dense. However, increases by those two species reached only approximate to 70% of the population density and approximate to 40% of the biomass density that S. planifrons had before the removals. Removal of S. planifrons had no effect on the abundances of S. diencaeus and S. leucostictus. Removal of S. partitus from eight reefs for 3 yr did not affect the abundances of S. planifrons or S. variabilis.
   Eleven years monitoring of adult populations and juvenile recruitment by S. partitus before and during the experiment show that its population increase after the removal of S. planifrons occurred while its overall abundance was gradually increasing, but was not associated with a period of unusually high juvenile recruitment.
   Thus asymmetric competition among closely related, ecologically similar, territorial coral reef fishes does sometimes control both abundances and microhabitat use in shared habitat. Interspecific territoriality and differences in body size and aggressiveness that lead to asymmetric competitive ability occur commonly among reef fishes in various trophic groups. Interspecific interactions within such groups of species often affect their patterns of habitat use. Hence the role that interspecific competition plays in limiting abundances of coral reef fishes requires reevaluation.

AB Much effort has focused on modeling and measuring the energy costs of free existence and the foraging strategies of animals. However, few studies have quantitatively linked these approaches to the patch structure of foods in the field. We developed an individual-based model that relates field measurements of the dispersion of benthic foods to search costs and foraging profitability of diving ducks.
   On Lake Mattamuskeet, North Carolina, Canvasback ducks (Aythya valisineria) eat only the belowground winter buds of the submerged plant Vallisneria americana. We measured and modeled the patch structure of winter buds at the level of potential foraging ''loci,'' defined as contiguous circles 1 m in diameter. In the field and in the model, Canvasbacks make repeated vertical dives in such loci, foraging in the sediments by touch, before surface-swimming to another locus. We quantified first-order patchiness by fitting a negative bi nomial distribution to core samples taken at 50-m intervals along transects, to yield the frequencies of loci with different bud densities. Second-order patchiness was measured by taking cores at 1-m increments radiating from each sampling point, and regressing bud density at each sampling point on densities at these increments. No significant correlations were found, indicating that Canvasbacks could not predict food densities based on densities in nearby foraging loci. For the model, we generated food grids from the negative binomial distributions of core samples.
   Energy costs of diving were calculated by applying aerobic efficiencies (mechanical power output divided by aerobic power input) to biomechanical models. Unlike respirometry alone, this method accounts for effects on dive costs of varying water depth and dive duration. We used measurements of Canvasback intake rates at different bud densities to calculate profitability (energy intake minus expenditure) for each dive. Multivariate uncertainty analyses (Latin hypercube) indicated that profitability for Canvasbacks foraging on Vallisneria buds is determined mainly by food-item size and locomotor costs of descent. Bud metabolizable energy, water temperature, bud dispersion, and search and handling time coefficients of the functional response for intake rate have relatively minor influence. Individual-parameter perturbations indicated that to maintain the same foraging benefits, the total area of Vallisneria habitat would have to increase by 1.4-fold if dry mass per bud decreased from 0.10 to 0.03 g, and by 2.1-fold if water depth increased from 0.5 to 2 m.
   Our method allows study of interactions between patch structure and foraging energetics without detailed spatial mapping of foods, which is not feasible at appropriate scales for highly mobile benthivores. The model yields estimates of energy balance, contaminant intake, and amount and quality of foraging habitat required to sustain diving duck populations under varying environmental conditions. More accurate prediction of giving-up times and giving-up food densities will require better understanding of the time scale over which ducks balance their energy budgets.

AB We report on a 32-yr study of a population of Spanish Imperial Eagles, Aquila adalberti, which increased during the first 16 yr of study but remained stable during the last 16 yr. We analyzed changes in the mean and variance of fecundity in relation to population density to test predictions of two hypotheses of density-dependent fecundity. According to the ''interference'' hypothesis, as density increases, frequency of agonistic encounters increases, resulting in a relatively uniform decrease in habitat quality. Consequently, mean fecundity decreases, and no relationship is expected between density and variance in fecundity. For the ''habitat heterogeneity'' hypothesis, however, as density increases, a greater proportion of individuals are forced to occupy lower quality habitats. Thus, mean fecundity decreases and fecundity variance must increase. Additionally, for this hypothesis, fecundities in good sites are expected to be equal in both low- and high-density situations. An inverse relationship between fecundity and population size was found in this eagle population. Annual variance in productivity showed significant increases over the study period. This trend was inversely related to mean productivity. Variance in productivity was related to the year of pair establishment, being higher in recently occupied territories. Mean and variance of the longer term territories remained constant during the study period. These results are in accordance with the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis.

AB Delayed inducible resistance (DIR) is triggered by artificial or herbivore-caused foliar damage and is manifested as decreased performance of herbivore generation(s) feeding on the trees subsequent to the generation during which the damage took place. DIR is associated with increase in concentrations of foliage phenolics and decrease in nitrogen. The growth-differentiation balance hypothesis, and the carbon-nutrient balance (CNB) hypothesis contained in it, claim that DIR is caused by nutritional stress after defoliation of trees growing on nutrient-poor soils. In these environments, nutrient uptake limits plant growth more strongly than does photosynthesis: that is, carbon-based secondary metabolites (e.g., phenolics) are prone to accumulate. According to the CNB hypothesis, an excess of limiting nutrient(s) or reduced photosynthetic rate should lead to elimination of DIR. We tested this using same-aged Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa trees of five open-pollinated families growing in a common arboretum in northernmost Finland. In addition to unmanipulated control trees, we had three nutritional treatments during three successive growth seasons: N-fertilization, PK-fertilization adding all nutrients except N, and shading to decrease carbon assimilation. Half of the trees in each treatment were artificially defoliated (50% leaf area) in the second study year, one year before the growth trial with geometrid (Epirrita autumnata) larvae.
   Tree growth measurements showed that N is the growth-limiting nutrient in our study area. N-fertilization and shading of the trees affected foliage chemistry generally as proposed by the CNB hypothesis. For example, they reduced foliar concentrations of total phenolics and condensed tannins. The birch families differed significantly in foliage chemistry. suggesting genetic differences, but the differences were not associated with fertilizations, shading, or defoliation of the trees. Contrary to fertilizing-shade treatments, changes in leaf chemistry and E. autumnata performance caused by defoliation were not consistent with the CNB hypothesis. For example, defoliation caused significant DIR irrespective of N-fertilization or shading. There were no significant differences among the birch families in performance of the moth larvae or in effects of fertilization, shade, or defoliation on larval performance. These responses to defoliation contrast with those of some other studies, especially those on the Betula resinifera-Rheumaptera hastata system in Alaska, which provide clear support for the CNB as an explanation of DIR. We find methodological differences to be an unlikely explanation for the different results but are unable to propose any single mechanism that will explain the diverse plant responses.

AB Evidence for parasite-induced host mortality from field data remains difficult to obtain. We have developed analytical models to investigate the effects of parasite-induced host mortality on the distribution of macroparasites among individual hosts as a function of host age. Under the assumptions of these models, it is shown that a decrease of the mean parasite load or of its dispersion implies that there is parasite-induced host mortality and that infection rate is variable for different hosts in the population. Observed patterns will depend on the nature of such variation and of the relation between parasite load and host mortality.

AB The potential harmful effects of non-indigenous species introduced for biological control remain an important unanswered question, which we addressed by undertaking a literature review. There are few documented instances of damage to non-target organisms or the environment from non-indigenous species released for biological pest control, relative to the number of such releases. However, this fact is not evidence that biological control is safe, because monitoring of non-target species is minimal, particularly in sites and habitats far from the point of release. In fact, the discovery of such impacts usually rests on a remarkable concatenation of events. In addition to trophic and competitive interactions between an individual introduced species and a native one, many effects of introduced species on ecosystems are possible, as are numerous types of indirect interactions. Predicting such impacts is no mean feat, and the difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that introduced species can disperse and evolve. Current regulation of introduced biological-control agents, particularly of entomophages, is insufficient. At the very least, strong consideration should be given to the likely impact of both the pest and its natural enemy on natural ecosystems and their species, and not only on potential costs to agriculture, silviculture, and species of immediate commercial value.

AB This paper investigates the effects of parental environment and genotype on offspring provisioning, structure, and growth traits in the annual plant Polygonum persicaria. Replicate offspring were studied from cloned individuals of five parental genotypes grown in high vs. low light, soil moisture, and soil nutrients. Genotypic norms of reaction were determined for ecologically important offspring traits. The effects on those traits of parental genotype, parental environment, and their interaction were tested by analysis of variance. The results showed that parental genotypes altered offspring traits in response to particular resource limits, such that offspring quality was maintained or enhanced despite parental resource deprivation. By maximizing the probability of offspring success, resource-deprived parental plants may partly offset the reduction in their fitness due to lower offspring number. Although overall patterns of plasticity were common to all parents, even this small sample revealed differences among parental genotypes in their response to environment. This may reflect the degree to which variation in fitness-related offspring traits occurs within parents and hence is unavailable to selection.

AB The food limitation hypothesis of population regulation states that a stable equilibrium will exist between a population and its food resources due to a density-dependent decrease in fecundity and/or increase in mortality. This hypothesis was tested for the moose (Alces alces) by comparing regional variation in life history characteristics in four Norwegian study areas, chosen to represent a gradient both in summer and winter range conditions.
   The rate of body growth was most rapid in the northern study area with the best summer ranges. Lowest body growth occurred in the population living under the poorest winter conditions. After snow-free winters the rate of body growth increased substantially, leading to large annual variations in yearling body masses. These differences in growth lead to significant age-specific differences between populations in female carcass masses in autumn.
   Probability of maturing as a yearling increased with body mass in the three southern populations. In contrast, in the northern study area no such relationship was found, leading to a delayed age at maturity in the population with the largest females. This shows that the relationship between age at maturity and body mass differs regionally, suggesting different selective regimes.
   The peak timing of ovulation of old females in the autumn showed a latitudinal delay. Females in the alpine population, with the poorest winter conditions, had significantly later mean calving dates and produced fewest calves per year. Gestation length appears to be dependent on nutritional condition of females during pregnancy.
   Mortality was highest in the northern study area where most of the deaths occurred during the summer. Very few calves died during the winter.
   These results suggest that a stable high-density equilibrium between moose and their food resources as expected from the food limitation hypothesis is unlikely. The decrease in fecundity and the increase in mortality under poor nutritional conditions during the winter has only a small effect on the population growth rate and is therefore unlikely to have a strong regulatory effect. In the absence of large predators, this will lead to large fluctuations in population size that will overshoot the carrying capacity.

AB The seasonal decline in clutch size has been explained as being due to either: (1) a constraining effect of female condition on both laying date and clutch size; or (2) a seasonal decline in the prospects of chick recruitment, leading to a strategic decrease in clutch size with laying date. In an effort to shed light on this area of disagreement, we analyzed the physiological condition (as measured by body mass, breast muscle thickness, and fat stores) and body size (as measured by wing and head lengths) of 184 female Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) nesting near Ithaca, New York in 1993, 1994, and 1995, and related their condition to their laying date and clutch size. Through multiple regressions, we found that female age and wing length were the only significant predictors of laying date and that female age and laying date were the only significant predictors of clutch size. Thus, when the effects of laying date were held constant, there was no detectable effect of condition on clutch size in this species. This result is inconsistent with the constraining-condition hypothesis, and it suggests that the seasonal decline of clutch size in Tree Swallows is most appropriately seen as a strategic adjustment by the female to varying prospects for her offspring. The lack of evolution in laying date in at least the Tree Swallow remains a paradox.

AB We present a method of comparing data on habitat use and availability that allows availability to differ among observations. This method is applicable when habitats change over time and when animals are unable to move throughout a predetermined study area between observations. We used maximum-likelihood techniques to derive an index that estimates the probability that each habitat type would be used if all were equally available. We also demonstrate how these indices can be used to compare relative use of available habitats, assign them ranks, and assess statistical differences between pairs of indices. The set of these indices for all habitats can be compared between groups of animals that represent different seasons, sex or age classes, or experimental treatments. This method allows quantitative comparisons among types and is not affected by arbitrary decisions about which habitats to include in the study. We provide an example by comparing the availability of four categories of sea ice concentration to their use by adult female polar bears (Ursus maritimus), whose movements were monitored by satellite radio tracking in the Bering and Chukchi Seas during 1990. Use of ice categories by bears was nonrandom, and the pattern of use differed between spring and late summer seasons.

AB The effect of landscape heterogeneity on the dispersal of organisms between habitat islands is poorly understood. Preferred pathways for dispersal (i.e., corridors), as well as dispersal barriers, are difficult to identify when the landscape matrix is composed of a complex mixture of land cover types. We developed an individual-based dispersal model to measure immigration and emigration rates between habitat islands within heterogeneous landscapes. Dispersing individuals of a model organism were simulated as self-avoiding random walkers (SAW) traversing a digital land cover map, with each habitat type assigned a priori a probability that the SAW would enter that habitat type. Each individual began the dispersal process on a random site at the edge of a deciduous forest patch and was allowed to move until it reached a different deciduous forest patch. Visualization of the movement patterns across the landscape was achieved by tabulating the frequency of visitation of successful dispersers to each grid cell on the map. The model was used to estimate the probabilities of disperser transfer between patches by varying the a priori probabilities of movement into each habitat type in order to: (1) estimate the effect of changing landscape heterogeneity on the transfer probabilities, and (2) visualize dispersal corridors and barriers as perceived by model organisms operating by specific movement rules and at specific scales. The results show that 89% of the variability in dispersal success can be accounted for by differences in the size and isolation of forest patches, with closer and larger patches having significantly greater exchange of dispersing organisms. However, changes in the heterogeneity of the landscape matrix could significantly enhance or decrease emigration success from an individual patch, depending on the landscape. Changes in emigration success from an individual patch resulting from changes in matrix heterogeneity were not predictable, and transfer rates between patches were not symmetrical due to differences in the proximity of neighboring patches, and differences in the funneling attributes of certain landscape patterns. Visualizations showed that corridors are often diffuse and difficult to identify from structural features of the landscape. A wide range of organisms with differing movement capabilities can be simulated using the approach presented to increase our understanding of how landscape structure affects organism dispersal.

AB Data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) indicate significant declines in the populations of several species of songbirds, including several Neotropical migrants. These declines have been attributed to habitat destruction and fragmentation on the breeding grounds, in strategic migratory stopover sites, and on the wintering grounds. Using BBS data from the 1967-1989 period and universal kriging, we produced maps of abundance change for two declining species of wood warblers to test hypothetical spatial scenarios of decline over entire breeding ranges. These species were the Cerulean Warbler (Dendroica cerulea) and the Prairie Warbler (D. discolor). We found considerable variability in the location of areas of decline when comparing successive 5-yr periods. In some comparisons, areas of decline were concentrated in the centers of abundance of these species, and in others, they were scattered throughout their range. We also found that the direction and intensity of population trends was quite sensitive to the methods used for calculating abundance. Our results indicate that, even for species where significant longterm declines have been reported, considerable variation exists in the direction of abundance change, both geographically and temporally, Although most of the long-term declines reported in particular species at local and regional scales are undeniable, gaps in our knowledge still prevent us from incorporating these trends into a global model of the annual cycle of Neotropical migrants.

AB It has been argued that ecological theory has not been useful to the practice of biological control. The purpose of this article is to show how recent theoretical advances may reverse this situation. We first discuss four issues that have arisen in the development of theory for biological control. (1) Recent work has clarified and resolved earlier disagreements concerning the effect of aggregation of the parasitoid to local host density on the stability of parasitoid-host models; this work emphasizes that such aggregation increases the ability of the parasitoid to reduce pest density, (2) There has been disagreement over the conditions under which stability, in the mathematical sense and on a local spatial scale, is an appropriate goal for classical biological control of insect pests, and whether a metapopulation may sometimes provide a more appropriate framework. We also comment on (3) relative size of refuges, which has been proposed as a unifying concept, and (4) density dependence and ratio dependence.
   We then discuss recent models using a stage-structured approach, particularly those that compare potential biological control agents or agents that have been differentially successful in practice. We argue that this approach has already produced valuable insights into the factors operating in several field situations. It demonstrates the importance of identifying which pest stages are most injurious to the crop, since the natural enemy that wins in competition may not be the most effective at suppressing the crucial pest stage(s): in general, the winning parasitoid reduces the density of the host stage attacked by its competitor below the level at which the latter can maintain a positive growth rate when at low density. A useful criterion is that pest equilibrium density is suppressed most by the parasitoid species that needs the fewest host individuals to allow a female parasitoid to replace herself in the next generation. Caveats are that this may apply only under equilibrium conditions and that the pest stage most suppressed is the one we wish to control. We discuss the connection between successful biological control and evolutionary considerations.

AB I studied top-down effects on creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) insect herbivores by protecting them from bird and arthropod predation. The purpose of my study was to investigate experimentally the differential and/or interactive effects of two predator guilds on herbivore densities. I performed my experiments on 24 creosotebushes at each of three sites within the Jornada Long-Term Ecological Research Site in the Chihuahuan Desert of southwestern New Mexico, USA. At each site the experiment consisted of: six creosotebushes from which birds were excluded with nylon mesh cages; six creosotebushes from which arthropod predators were removed by hand or aspirator; six creosotebushes from which both birds and arthropod predators were removed; and six control creosotebushes from which neither birds nor arthropod predators were removed. I conducted nondestructive nocturnal visual censuses of herbivores on each creosotebush at the beginning of the experiments in mid-May, 6 wk after the start of the experiment in late June, and 12 wk after the start of the experiment in early August. I conducted these experiments and censuses in 1993 and again in 1994.
   In both years the herbivore densities became significantly higher in experimental than in control creosotebushes. The effects of bird and arthropod predation on herbivore densities were additive in 1993, but they were compensatory in 1994. In 1994 arthropod predator densities became lower in creosotebushes from which birds had been removed than in creosotebushes from which birds had not been removed, but this result did not obtain in 1993. These results may be due to a combination of factors including: avian and arthropod predation on herbivores, ''intraguild'' predation of birds on arthropod predators, and competition within the herbivore community. The relative numerical impacts of the predator-removal experiments varied among seasons and among sites within either year, but temporal and spatial variation in predator impacts did not correlate strongly with known gradients of climatic or bottom-up heterogeneity in this system. The results of this study confirm the important direct and cumulative effects of multiple predator guilds, even against a complex background of temporal and spatial heterogeneity.

AB Plant developmental responses to shade are the combination of reductions in photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and changes in spectral quality (reductions in the quantum ratio of red to far-red band widths, R:FR). We studied the seedling development of six Asian tropical rain forest trees, Dryobalanops aromatica, Endospermum malaccense, Hopea wightiana, Parkia javanica, Shorea singkawang, and Sindora echinocalyx under varying PPFD and R:FR. Seedlings were grown in replicated shadehouse treatments: (1) 40% solar PPFD and 1.25 R:FR; (2) 11% PPFD and 1.25 R:FR; (3) 11% PPFD and 0.24 R:FR; (4) 3% PPFD and 1.25 R:FR; and (5) 3% PPFD and 0.23 R:FR. Species differed in the influence of light variables on seedling (I) total height; (2) internode distance; (3) branch to trunk internodes; (4) stem length/mass; (5) leaf area/stem length; (6) percent allocation to leaf, stem and root mass; (7) specific leaf mass; (8) mean leaf area; (9) leaf thickness; (10) petiole length; and (11) stomatal density. The simple factorial design of treatments 2-5 allowed a two-way ANOVA and the calculation of coefficients of determination of the treatment effects. The characters in most taxa were primarily influenced by light intensity, but spectral quality also influenced characters in many cases. The taxa that responded most strongly to the light treatments were the most shade-intolerant: E. malaccense and P. javanica; the former species responded strongly to R:FR, particularly in stem mass allocation and leaf area/stem length. The four taxa with moderate-to-extreme shade tolerance varied considerably in responses of individual characters to R:FR and PPFD. The patterns of morphological responses to reduced PPFD and R:FR help explain how the shade tolerances of the seedlings of rain forest trees vary in a continuous manner. Recommendations concerning seedling shade tolerance for sylviculture or nursery practice may need revision if they were based on shade trials using spectrally neutral shade fabrics or slat houses. Future research on the effects of shading on tree seedling development and ecology must consider the potential influence of changes in spectral quality under canopy shade.

AB The relationships between biodiversity and stability were determined for both population and ecosystem traits in a long-term study of 207 grassland plots. Results demonstrate that biodiversity stabilizes community and ecosystem processes, but not population processes. Specifically, year-to-year variability in total aboveground plant community biomass was significantly lower in plots with greater plant species richness both for the entire 11-yr period and for the nine non-drought years. The change in total plant community biomass from before the drought to the peak of the drought was also highly dependent on species richness. For all three measures of total community biomass stability, multiple regressions that controlled for covariates showed similar significant relationships between plant diversity and stability.
   In contrast, year-to-year variability in species abundances was not stabilized by plant species richness for either all years or non-drought years. This difference between species vs. community biomass likely results from interspecific competition. When climatic variations harm some species, unharmed competitors increase. Such compensatory increases stabilize total community biomass, but cause species abundances to be more variable. These results support both the predictions of Robert May concerning the effects of diversity on population stability and the diversity-stability hypothesis as applied to community and ecosystem processes, thus helping to reconcile a long-standing dispute.

AB We investigated spatial and temporal variability in recruitment of coral reef fishes to St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, with the goal of assessing the importance of habitat and physical oceanographic processes in determining patterns of distribution at two spatial scales. Recruitment was monitored visually each month, using SCUBA, at sites spaced equally around the island and on transects within each site.
   Spatial patterns of distribution were consistent within seasons and between years at both spatial scales. Although recruitment showed a seasonal pattern, there were few interannual differences at any spatial scale. At the largest scale, recruitment varied significantly among sites around the island, and a unique pattern of distribution was observed. On the windward shore, recruitment ranged from high on the eastern (upcurrent) end to low on western end of the island. Recruitment showed the opposite pattern on the leeward shore, ranging from low on the eastern end to high on the western end.
   At the transect scale, certain features of the habitat significantly predicted recruitment density. None of the microhabitat features that predicted recruitment at the small scale could explain patterns of recruitment observed at the large scale. In contrast, physical processes affecting larval availability or transport were more important than habitat in determining the spatial patterns of recruitment at this scale.
   Thus, physical oceanographic processes: appeared to be responsible fur patterns of recruitment to the two shores of Sr. Croix, and to sites along those shores. Despite consistent patterns of recruitment to sites, habitat selection did nor appear to be important at the site scale. Once delivered to a site, however, settlers or new recruits distributed themselves based on habitat preferences.

AB Comparative data from subalpine wetlands in Colorado indicate that larvae of the limnephilid caddisflies, Asynarchus nigriculus and Limnephilus externus, are reciprocally abundant among habitats-Limnephilus larvae dominate in permanent waters, whereas Asynarchus larvae dominate in temporary basins. The purpose of this paper is to report on field and laboratory experiments that link this pattern of abundance to biotic interactions among larvae. In the first field experiment, growth and survival were compared in single and mixed species treatments in littoral enclosures. Larvae, which eat mainly vascular plant detritus, grew at similar rates among treatments in both temporary and permanent habitats suggesting that exploitative competition is not important under natural food levels and caddisfly densities. However, the survival of Limnephilus larvae was reduced in the presence of Asynarchus larvae. Subsequent behavioral studies in laboratory arenas revealed that Asynarchus larvae are extremely aggressive predators on Limnephilus larvae. In a second field experiment we manipulated the relative sizes of larvae and found that Limnephilus larvae were preyed on only when Asynarchus larvae had the same size advantage observed in natural populations. Our data suggest that the dominance of Asynarchus larvae in temporary habitats is due to asymmetric intraguild predation (IGP) facilitated by a phenological head start in development. These data do not explain the dominance of Limnephilus larvae in permanent basins, which we show elsewhere to be an indirect effect of salamander predation.
   Behavioral observations also revealed that Asynarchus larvae are cannibalistic. In contrast to the IGP on Limnephilus larvae, Asynarchus cannibalism occurs among same-sized larvae and often involves the mobbing of one victim by several conspecifics. In a third field experiment, we found that Asynarchus cannibalism was not density-dependent and occurred even at low larval densities. We hypothesize that Asynarchus IGP and cannibalism provide a dietary supplement to detritus that may be necessary for the timely completion of development in these nutrient-poor, high-elevation wetlands.

AB Kernel density estimators are becoming more widely used, particularly as home range estimators. Despite extensive interest in their theoretical properties, little empirical research has been done to investigate their performance as home range estimators. We used computer simulations to compare the area and shape of kernel density estimates to the true area and shape of multimodal two-dimensional distributions. The fixed kernel gave area estimates with very little bias when least squares cross validation was used to select the smoothing parameter. The cross-validated fixed kernel also gave surface estimates with the lowest error. The adaptive kernel overestimated the area of the distribution and had higher error associated with its surface estimate.

AB Interactions among viruses, vectors, and host plants may influence the spread and success of plant viruses. Major factors include direct competition within host plants, direct competition within vectors, differences in transmission rates, and virus influences on vector behavior and population dynamics. The aphid-transmitted barley yellow dwarf viruses (BYDVs), which infect a broad range of grasses worldwide, represent a model system for addressing questions about the outcome of direct and indirect competition between viruses. Historical shifts in the relative prevalence of BYDV strains document the apparent displacement of one virus strain (PAV) by another (MAV) over 20 yr.
   In the barley yellow dwarf system, transmission rate appears td play an important role in determining the outcome of competition between viruses. Moreover, the interaction between transmission rate and vector behavior may be particularly important. PAV is the stronger competitor within hosts, where double infections occur more often than in insect vectors. PAV also has significant advantages due to higher overall transmission rates than MAV. In addition, vector aphids show a strong nonpreference for PAV that may lead to greater rates of virus spread.

AB Reproduction is closely tied to environmental conditions and the availability of resources, and thus typically varies with season. Consequently, perennial organisms that reproduce continuously are generally restricted to tropical regions with relatively aseasonal climates. The temperate marine alga Macrocystis pyrifera is a rare exception in this regard, as most individuals reproduce throughout the year in a seasonally variable habitat. Here we measure reproductive responses of the giant kelp Mncrocystis during a period in which resources and environmental conditions fluctuated greatly and contrast these responses with those of the palm kelp, Pterygophora californica, a sympatric species that exhibits strictly seasonal reproduction.
   The quantity and quality of spore production tracked resource availability within and among years for Macrocystis, but not for Pterygophora. Reproductive allocation and spore standing stock in Macrocystis were negatively correlated with seawater temperature and positively correlated with the nitrogen content of adult plants. Macrocystis generally displayed two seasonally distinct peaks in spore production per year (winter and spring). The only disruption of this pattern coincided with a warmwater El Nino event. Although seawater temperature and the nitrogen content of adults were inversely related in Pterygophora, neither variable was significantly correlated with the quantity or quality of spore production in this species. Unlike Mncrocystis, Pterygophora exhibited a well-defined reproductive season in which plants displayed a single broad peak in spore production that varied little in timing and magnitude among years, even during El Nino conditions. Spore C/N ratios remained relatively constant over time in both species, despite large seasonal fluctuations in C/N ratios of vegetative tissue of adults plants. Nonetheless, spore C/N ratios were positively correlated with seawater temperature in Macrocystis but not in Pterygophora. Spore viability (swimming and germination) varied considerably, and often unpredictably, over time for both species.
   Our results support the general idea that environmental conditions and resources exert a much greater influence on the quantity and quality of reproduction in species that reproduce continuously than on the majority of species that are strictly seasonal in onset of reproduction The differential responses of Macrocystis and Pterygophora may reflect their different morphologies and life-spans. Macrocystis is relatively short lived and may ''hedge its bets'' by reproducing continuously rather than risk delaying reproduction. Conversely, since Pterygophora lives much longer, plants can afford to release spores only during times when the chances for reproductive success are predictably greatest because these plants are likely to reproduce again in subsequent years.

AB Low-density populations of gypsy moth, Lymantria ia dispar, were studied over a 10-yr period in Massachusetts. Increases in gypsy moth density were associated with declines in density of the white-fooled mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, a principal predator. Furthermore, changes in density of P. leucopus populations were positively correlated with the density of acorn crops, a dominant winter food sourer for these mice. To demonstrate these effects we used a novel bootstrap regression method that adjusts for spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the time series data. The findings are compatible with a dual equilibrium model of gypsy moth population dynamics, in which low densities are regulated by mice and high densities are regulated by other factors, notably a virus disease.

AB Mothers may be able to manipulate the phenotypes of their progeny not only via direct pathways (e.g., allocation of nutrients and energy), but also indirectly, by inducing particular developmental pathways through selection of nest sites and thus, incubation conditions. In the field, female skinks (Bassiana duperreyi) in montane southeastern Australia select nest sites with specific thermal characteristics-especially, a high mean temperature and a high diel range in temperature. Monitoring of 14 natural nests throughout most of the incubation period revealed considerable differences among nests in both means and variances of thermal regimes. Laboratory experiments on this species show that both the mean and the variance of incubation temperatures profoundly influence developmental rates (and hence, incubation periods) as well as the body shape, activity levels, thermoregulatory behavior, and running speeds of the hatchlings. Hence, a female's selection of a particular nest site can substantially modify both the time of emergence of the hatchlings, and the morphology and behavior of her offspring. Even within a single nest, minor differences among eggs in their depth below the ground surface will directly affect thermal variance, and so may strongly influence rates of embryogenesis and the phenotype of the hatchling. The effects of thermal variance (independent of the mean) on embryonic development rates and hatchling phenotypes suggest that data from constant-temperature incubation in the laboratory should be interpreted with caution.

AB Comparison of long-term records of local wetland vegetation dynamics with regional, climate-forced terrestrial vegetation changes can be used to differentiate the rates and effects of autogenic successional processes and allogenic environmental change on wetland vegetation dynamics. We studied Holocene plant macrofossil and pollen sequences from Portage Marsh, a shallow, 18-ha marsh in northeastern Indiana. Between 10 000 and 5700 yr BP the basin was occupied by a shallow, open lake, while upland vegetation consisted of mesic forests of Pinus, Quercus, Ulmus, and Carya. At 5700 yr BP the open lake was replaced rapidly by a shallow marsh, while simultaneously Quercus savanna developed on the surrounding uplands. The marsh was characterized by periodic drawdowns, and the uplands by periodic fires. Species composition of the marsh underwent further changes between 3000 and 2000 yr BP. Upland pollen spectra at Portage Marsh and other sites in the region shifted towards more mesic vegetation during that period. The consistency and temporal correspondence between the changes in upland vegetation and marsh vegetation indicate that the major vegetational changes in the marsh during the Holocene resulted from hydrologic changes forced by regional climate change. Progressive shallowing of the basin by autogenic accumulation of organic sediment constrained vegetational responses to climate change but did not serve as the direct mechanism of change.

AB Determinants of adult dispersal were studied in a population of color-banded Merlins (Falco columbarius). In the analysis, I examined the effects of local population density, breeding performance, survival, and characteristics of the mate on movements between breeding seasons. The distance moved between successive breeding seasons varied greatly, both between and within individuals. Fidelity to the breeding areas was higher in males than females, and females dispersed nearly three times as far as males did.
   Males breeding at high density dispersed shorter distances than other males. Dispersal distances of females were related to aspects of the mate. Females that mated with older males, and with males that survived to the next season. made shorter movements than other females. In both sexes, low reproductive success was associated with long dispersal distances in the next year. Moreover, nest predation in one season resulted in lower return rate by females, but not males. Hence, breeding Merlins responded to their social as well as natural environment by dispersing from areas associated with low survival and poor reproductive performance.

AB Indirect effects occurring through chains of direct species interactions have been shown to be important in many communities. If indirect effects have strong ecological effects, then they must also have strong evolutionary effects through natural selection. We consider how indirect effects, both positive and negative, combine with positive and negative direct effects to influence evolution between interacting species. Any one species can evolve in response to direct interactions with other species by changing its ''response'' to the presence of the other species or changing its ''effect'' on the species. We argue that the direction (positive or negative) of the direct and indirect effects will determine whether traits related to ''response'' or ''effect'' are most likely to be subject to natural selection. Further, covariance patterns of species in the same community should increase when direct and indirect effects between species act in the same direction, resulting in greater compartmentalization of such communities.

AB Nutrient retention studies were conducted in two second-order streams located north of Barcelona (Spain) that differed in watershed lithology, soil type, and vegetation. La Solana drains a calcareous watershed, whereas Riera Major drains a siliceous watershed. Within each stream we defined two reaches (50 m) differing in channel form and canopy cover: bedrock and sand-cobble. The bedrock reaches were characterized by a dominance of bedrock outcrop and a sparse canopy, while the sand-cobble reaches had sand, cobble, and boulder substrata and a dense canopy. Phosphate and ammonium uptake length and uptake rate were measured in each reach by performing several short-term additions (2 h) of phosphate and ammonium. Releases were conducted from summer 1990 to spring 1992 to encompass seasonal changes in environmental conditions. We examined temporal trends in nutrient uptake length to test the influence of watershed geomorphology and local channel form on nutrient retention in these two Mediterranean streams. Because both nutrients were added simultaneously, we were able, by using the ratio of each nutrient's uptake length, to compare ammonium and phosphate retention in each reach. Results of a two-way ANOVA indicated that both stream and reach type had significant effects on phosphate and ammonium uptake lengths. However, channel form had a different effect depending on the stream. In La Solana, shortest phosphate uptake lengths (highest efficiency in phosphate retention) were measured in summer, whereas shortest ammonium uptake lengths were measured in winter in the two reaches. In this stream, both nutrients were retained with greater efficiency in the bedrock reach than in the sand-cobble reach (mean uptake length was 59 +/- 12 m for phosphate and 59 +/- 14 m for ammonium in the bedrock reach, means +/- 1 SE, n = 13 for both nutrients; and 119 +/- 19 m for phosphate and 182 +/- 51 m for ammonium in the sand-cobble reach, n = 12 for each nutrient). In Riera Major, only the bedrock reach exhibited a seasonality in nutrient uptake length that was similar to that found in La Solana reaches. The sand-cobble reach in Riera Major showed higher efficiency in ammonium retention than the bedrock reach (85 +/- 16 m, n = 14; and 189 +/- 28 m, n = 10, respectively); but phosphate uptake lengths did not differ between reaches to a statistically significant extent (163 +/- 26 m in the sand-cobble reach, n = 14; and 191 +/- 32 m in the bedrock reach, n = 10). When the two streams were compared, La Solana exhibited higher nutrient retention efficiencies (shorter uptake lengths) than Riera Major. However, nutrient uptake rates for both nutrients were higher in Riera Major because of greater nutrient loadings. Mean phosphate uptake rates at ambient levels for the whole study period were 45.4 +/- 10.8 mu g P . m(-2). min(-1) in La Solana (n = 25) and 175.5 +/- 68.6 mu g P . m(-2). min(-1) in Riera Major (n = 24); and mean ammonium uptake rates at ambient levels were 103.3 +/- 27.4 and 186.7 +/- 48.6 mu g N . m(-1)min(-1), respectively. Finally, nutrient uptake lengths from this study are within the range reported for other streams of similar order. Overall results indicate that differences in ammonium retention efficiency in these streams may be tightly related to in-stream processes. In contrast, major between-stream differences in phosphate retention efficiency appear to be a function of overall phosphate availability.

AB The indirect effect of insect predators on the chemistry and performance of host plants of their prey is a central issue in the study of tritrophic-level interactions. Few experimental studies evaluate chemistry and performance of host plants fed upon by insect herbivores in the presence and absence of predators. To examine these relationships, we conducted a field experiment using the plant Plantago lanceolata, which contains the iridoid glycosides aucubin and catalpol. Each plot had two plants, designated the ''colonization'' plant upon which four insect herbivores were initially placed and the ''dispersal'' plant, to which the herbivores could move. We contrasted the effects of two insect herbivores, Junonia coenia (Nymphalidae), a specialist feeder, vs. Spilosoma congrua (Arctiidae), a more generalized feeder, and the effects of variation in their densities caused by two different types of insect predators, Podisus maculiventris stink bugs and Polistes fuscatus wasps, on host plant growth and phytochemistry. We contrasted these to plots without herbivores.
   The two herbivore species had different impacts on iridoid glycoside concentration of their host plants. Iridoid glycoside concentrations were higher in plants that had been used by the specialist J. coenia compared to those fed upon by the generalist S. congrua In contrast to a previous study, herbivory did not induce higher iridoid glycoside concentration. The two herbivore species had similar impacts on plant mass.
   Predation by wasps and stink bugs had different indirect effects (via the interaction of predators and herbivores) on iridoid glycoside concentration and plant mass. Aucubin concentration was lower for plants that had had wasps than those with stink bugs. For plants with the specialist J. coenia, catalpol concentration was lower for plants that had had predators, and iridoid glycoside concentrations were lower for plants that had had wasps present than those that had stink bugs. Leaf mass was higher when predators were present than when predators were absent. For the plants with the specialist J. coenia, scape mass was higher for those that had predators present than those without predators. We discuss the potential for an indirect facultative mutualism between the host plant plantain and the insect predators, and conclude that such a mutualism is transitory, at best.

AB We present two laboratory experiments designed to show how cannibalism and its effects on population numbers and size structure vary in response to density, size, and food manipulations in larvae of the dragonfly Epitheca cynosura. Because young larvae of this species interact at very high densities after hatching asynchronously from clumps of egg masses, our efforts focused on these early stages. In one experiment, we varied the combination of sizes (instars) and the presence of food for 233 pairs of early-instar larvae. Cannibalism was uncommon if larvae were of the same instar (only 2.4% of such pairs exhibited cannibalism), frequent (53%) if larvae differed by one instar, and certain (100%) if a two-instar size difference was present. The rate at which cannibalism increased with size differences between larvae was greater when food was absent than it was when food sr was provided. In a second experiment, we subjected replicate cohorts of newly hatched dragonflies to manipulations of hatching synchrony, initial density, and food availability. Asynchronous hatching over 25 d produced a broad size distribution apparently conducive to cannibalism, whereas synchronous hatching over 3 d initially precluded cannibalism. As a result, strong density-dependent mortality only appeared following the asynchronous hatch. For high-density, asynchronous treatments, cannibalism significantly reduced size variation and tightened size distributions over the course of development. Survivors from high-density treatments were significantly larger than were low-density survivors. More abundant food allowed larvae to reach larger sizes, but did not improve survival. Survival was affected mainly by the density and size distribution of larvae. These results suggest that cannibalism was more important than exploitative competition for food in determining the size and survival of dragonflies in the laboratory. We conclude that when juveniles hatch asynchronously in close proximity, cannibalism can: (1) contribute to population lation by imposing greater per capita mortality at high densities, and (2) increase population synchrony by exerting size-specific mortality on smaller individuals throughout development.

AB In reward-producing animal-pollinated plants, small populations are likely to be less attractive to pollinators than large populations. The likelihood of pollinator limitation of seed production should therefore increase with decreasing population size. I documented the number of flowering plants and plant fecundity in 18 populations of the self-incompatible, tristylous herb Lythrum salicaria within an archipelago in northern Sweden in two consecutive years. To test the hypothesis that a positive correlation between population size and seed set is due to a higher degree of pollinator limitation in small than in large populations, I performed supplemental hand-pollinations in eight (1993) and 13 (1994) of the study populations. To test the hypothesis that common mating types are more likely than rare types to experience inadequate pollination, I compared the natural level of seed production and the effect of supplemental pollination in different style morphs in the five populations in which greater than or equal to 10 plants per morph were included in the experiment. There was no significant correlation between population size and plant size in terms of number of floral shoots or number of flower-producing leaf nodes per shoot. However, there was a positive relationship between population size and seed production per flower and between population size and total seed number per plant. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between population size and seed production of flowers that had received supplemental pollination. In both years, the difference in mean seed production per flower between hand-pollinated flowers and controls decreased with increasing population size. In two of five populations, the effect of supplemental pollination differed significantly among morphs. Seed production was more likely to be pollinator limited in long-styled than in short-styled plants, but this difference could not be attributed to a preponderance of the long-styled morph in the studied populations. Results of the supplemental hand-pollinations indicate that the positive correlation between population size and seed production is a function of insufficient pollen transfer in small populations. Additional demographic studies are needed to determine to what extent the reduced level of seed production in small populations limits the growth of young populations, and to what extent it may threaten the local persistence of L. salicaria.

AB A model by Levin and Udovic (1977) emphasizes the need for integration of studies of the numerical abundances and genetic composition of host and pathogen species. We use their conceptual framework to summarize our collaborative research on the ecological genetics of the anther-smut disease of Silene alba caused by the fungus Ustilago violacea. Our theoretical investigations have revealed the importance of the rate and mode of disease transmission on the likelihood of coexistence between host and pathogen. Our empirical studies have quantified patterns of disease spread on local and regional spatial scales and have shown that host genotypes differ greatly in resistance. Comparable genetic variation in pathogen virulence has not yet been demonstrated. The genetic composition of host populations alters numerical dynamics in experimental populations: disease declines in resistant populations, while host and pathogen appear to coexist in susceptible populations. Ecological outcomes also may be affected by the negative relationship between disease incidence and host flowering time, which may constitute a ''cost'' to resistance. We are currently expanding our work on the ecology and genetics of metapopulation dynamics of host and pathogen.

AB An individual host's likelihood of acquiring an infectious disease depends, in large part, on the location of the host relative to sources of infection, proximity to other hosts, and occupation of specific microhabitats that confer increased susceptibility. Spatial organization of the host and pathogen populations then may be critical in determining patterns of disease occurrence and dynamics. We discuss three fundamental problems associated with understanding the interactions of plants, pathogens, and spatial structure: (1) how one characterizes spatial patterns, (2) how we determine spatial dynamic processes from a given spatial pattern, and (3) how we then simulate the spatial dynamics presumed to be dominating a given host-pathogen interaction.
   To demonstrate methods for the characterization of spatial pattern, we analyzed spatial maps of a Silene latifolia population infected with the anther smut Microbotryum violaceum, using join-count statistics, continuous spatial autocorrelation, and Mantel's test. Different statistical techniques provided different interpretations of the same data set, indicating the value of using multiple methods. We described spatial structure in the plant population, the pathogen population (factoring out the plant population structure), and spatial cross correlation between two variables (plant gender and disease status). Each of these tests provides information on how the disease may be spreading in the population.
   We are not very optimistic about the prospect of determining underlying disease-spread processes purely from analysis of spatial pattern. Most spatial patterns can potentially be generated by a number of biological processes (e.g., ''true'' vs. ''apparent'' contagion), and it is not possible to distinguish between hypotheses without additional information about the system.
   A difficulty in modeling spatial processes is simulation of populations with given spatial patterns. Simulated spatially structured populations are useful for predicting disease dynamics in a spatial context. We present a number of techniques for creating these spatially structured populations, including a method we developed for modeling the effect of vector behavior on the spread of a plant virus.

AB Minta and Mangel (1989) developed a Monte Carlo method for estimating population size from mark-resight data in which there is considerable variability in the resighting frequencies among individuals and irregular census surveys. Their method assumed that sightings were perfect, so that all animals present (marked or unmarked) were resighted. We describe an updated version that allows a proportion 1 - p of the individuals present to be overlooked during censusing. We compare confidence interval coverage for the original method and the updated method using simulated data sets, describe a method to estimate p, and evaluate how error in estimating p affects confidence interval coverage. The updated method for estimating a confidence interval performs considerably better than the original estimate. We find that p can be overestimated by 30% or underestimated by 10% and the confidence interval generated still includes the true population size 90% of the time. This technique may improve confidence interval estimates for small and threatened populations.

AB Lotka-Volterra (LV) equations have been used extensively to explore the possible dynamic outcomes of interspecific competition. But while there have been hundreds of papers on the mathematical properties of Lotka-Volterra models, there have been only a handful of papers that explore techniques for fitting these models to actual data, and no papers that explore the interface of experimental design and statistical inference when fitting LV equations to census data. In this paper we present a statistical analysis of Gause's experimental cultures of Paramecium aurelia and P. caudatum, using analytical methods based on maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. We compare the effectiveness of these two approaches in addressing several questions about competition from experimental data: Are the mutual effects of competing populations substantial? Are these competitive effects symmetrical? Are two populations expected to coexist or to eliminate each other by competition? We show that even a laboratory-derived data set with minimal variability can entail significant levels of uncertainty about the nature of the competitive interaction. We assess the errors involved in estimating the strength and symmetry of competition, and find that one's conclusions depend critically on assumptions about sources of variability in the data. We also estimate the probabilities of alternative dynamic behaviors for competing species. We use simulations to evaluate how particular experimental designs might improve our power to characterize the dynamic; outcome of competition. We show that much more information is gained by running competition experiments at different starring conditions than by replicating the same experiment for a particular starting condition.

AB We examined the reproductive success and long-term population dynamics of Neotropical migrant birds in the fragmented landscapes of Illinois. Our primary objective was to assess whether annual variation in abundances and persistence of populations within woodlots was related to variation in reproductive success. Nesting success of migrants was so low in the woodlots where we sampled that it is unlikely that these populations are self-sustaining. Moreover, populations frequently disappear from and recolonize these woodlots. These data suggest that the source-sink metaphor for population dynamics within spatially structured populations is applicable to migratory birds in Illinois. The scale of this dynamic is unknown, but may be regional (i.e., midwestern U.S.).
   An important implication of this result is that census data must be interpreted carefully. For one woodlot, we detected no systematic trend in the overall abundances of migratory birds over much of the 20th century. Yet the viability of populations within that woodlot likely decreased dramatically over that time owing to increasing rates of nest predation and brood parasitism.
   Lack of data on dispersal is a major gap in understanding the population dynamics of Neotropical migrants and prescribing effective conservation measures.

DE National Biological Survey; Neotropical migrants; nonlinear regression;
   North American Breeding Bird Survey; population trends
ID REGRESSION
AB Although there is strong evidence that a few Neotropical migrant land birds have severely declining populations, we know of no evidence of general overall declines. One widely cited analysis of data from the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), the only continental-scale monitoring program for land birds in the breeding season, indicates declining populations in eastern forests in the 1980s, but other analyses conclude that most species have had stable or increasing populations in the last 25 ye These conflicting results call for a new perspective. Here, we propose two approaches to the analysis of BBS data that emphasize the detection of temporal and geographic variation in population trends. The first approach uses nonlinear regression to detect temporal changes in population trends, and permits the construction of graphs that compare nonlinear trends among regions. The second approach provides statistical tests of multispecies patterns of geographic variation in population trends.
   We report analyses of BBS data for 1966 to 1992 for the 26 species of wood warblers (Parulinae) for which the most data are available and the chance of obtaining reliable estimates is best. Using pooled data for all 26 species for eastern and central North America, nonlinear regression indicated declining populations in the Appalachian Mountains and the Eastern Foothills in the 1970s, and stability elsewhere. As examples of the use of this first approach in single-species analyses, we give maps, graphs, and statistical tests to illustrate variation in population trends by physiographic strata in the Blue-winged Warbler (Vermivora pinus) and the Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus). As an example of the second approach, we applied a probit-normal model to a matrix of increases and decreases in the 26 species in 37 geographic strata. The analysis identified specific highland areas as having unusually high proportions of declining populations. These results suggest that correlates of elevation should be considered as factors possibly regulating populations of warblers and other land birds. Our perspective is that focus on studies of temporal and geographic variation in population trends of all birds, including Neotropical migrants, could help conservation biologists identify where species and groups of species are in the most trouble.

AB A fundamental question in plant ecology is if and how the intensity of competition changes with productivity. This question has been the source of considerable discussion during the last two decades, yet few experiments have tested whether competition intensity changes with productivity in nature. Even fewer studies have separated competition into its above- and belowground components in the field. We used a field experiment to measure total competition intensity and its above- and belowground components in two wetlands that represent extremes in habitat productivity: an infertile sandy shoreline and a fertile bay. Transplants of Lythrum salicaria and Carer crinita were grown with no neighbors, with roots of neighbors only, and with roots and shoots of neighbors; their growth rates were used to measure competition intensity (CI). The experiment was carried out to answer the following main questions: (1) Is there a difference in total, above- and ground competition intensity in two wetlands that differ in standing crop? and (2) Is there an effect of standing crop on total, above- and belowground competition intensity when the data from the two wetlands are combined?
   Results based on the average of both species show that total and aboveground competition intensity were greater in the high standing crop wetland, but belowground competition did not differ between wetlands (CITOTAL: P < 0.00001, CIABOVE: P = 0.0013, CIBELOW:P = 0.58). Total and aboveground competition intensity were significantly affected by standing crop in the wetlands studied but belowground competition intensity was not (Cl-TOTAL: P = 0.0001, CIABOVE: P = 0.0001, CIBELOW: P = 0.89). Results based on the two species separately show that species vary in their sensitivity to competition in wetland communities.

AB Models that describe the spread of invading organisms often assume that the dispersal distances of propagules are normally distributed. In contrast, measured dispersal curves are typically leptokurtic, not normal. In this paper, we consider a class of models, integrodifference equations, that directly incorporate detailed dispersal data as well as population growth dynamics. We provide explicit formulas for the speed of invasion for compensatory growth and for different choices of the propagule redistribution kernel and apply these formulas to the spread of D. pseudoobscura. We observe that: (1) the speed of invasion of a spreading population is extremely sensitive to the precise shape of the redistribution kernel and, in particular, to the tail of the distribution; (2) fat-tailed kernels can generate accelerating invasions rather than constant-speed travelling waves; (3) normal redistribution kernels (and by inference, many reaction-diffusion models) may grossly underestimate rates of spread of invading populations in comparison with models that incorporate more realistic leptokurtic distributions; and (4) the relative superiority of different redistribution kernels depends, in general, on the precise magnitude of the net reproductive rate. The addition of an Allee effect to an integrodifference equation may decrease the overall rate of spread. An Allee effect may also introduce a critical range; the population must surpass this spatial threshold in order to invade successfully. Fat-tailed kernels and Allee effects provide alternative explanations for the accelerating rates of spread observed for many invasions.

AB In tallgrass prairie, high plant species diversity results not from a large number of grass species, but from a large number of forb (nongrass, herbaceous) species. Forbs exhibit morphological, life history, and ecophysiological characteristics that contrast sharply with those of the dominant C-4 grasses. Success of the subdominant forbs varies strongly with topographic position and burning regime, and landscape scale patterns of abundance are well documented. But comparatively little is known about the mechanisms determining these patterns in persistent tallgrass prairie forbs. To elucidate these mechanisms, (1) leaf-level physiological characteristics of the dominant C-4 grass, Andropogon gerardii, and four co-occurring C-3 forbs were measured in response to natural and experimentally manipulated gradients of N availability, and (2) seasonal light environments of forbs in contrasting topographic positions and burning regimes and their morphological and physiological responses in these environments were compared to determine whether resource availability and utilization patterns contributed to patterns of forb distribution and abundance. The effects of burning regime and topographic position on maximum rate of photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance to water vapor (g) measured at the leaf level were not consistent with patterns of forb abundance. Nitrogen did not appear to limit forb physiological processes, even though increased N availability resulted in higher tissue N concentrations and greater biomass. There was no consistent increase in A or decrease in g in response to fertilization. However, A at low light levels was as much as 67% higher in fertilized Vernonia baldwinii and A. gerardii compared to unfertilized plants. Greater light availability to forbs in the canopy was associated with lower grass biomass production in uplands compared to lowlands and in unburned compared to burned sites. Forbs did not appear to adjust morphologically (leaf area and plant height) to different light environments at different sites. As a result, as much as 90% of forb leaf area in the burned lowland was displayed in low light, whereas as little as 30% of forb leaf area was in low light in the uplands at midseason. Estimates of potential whole-plant carbon uptake, based on leaf area distribution relative to available light and A as a function of light availability, agreed well with patterns of forb abundance and production. Differences in light availability may account for much of the variability in forb abundance related to burning regime and topographic position by limiting carbon gain in forbs more in burned lowlands than in other sites.

AB The response of phytoplankton to nutrient (N, P) and planktivorous fish additions (Phoxinus sp.) was compared between two sets of enclosures (8 m in diameter) installed at different depths in a dimictic temperate lake. One set of eight enclosures was located in the deep part of the lake (12 m) where water thermally stratifies during the summer. The other set of eight enclosures was located in a shallow area of the lake (3.5 m) where the water does not thermally stratify. During the summer months, phyytoplankton cell number and biomass increased significantly with both nutrient additions (P = 0.004) and the presence of planktivorous fish (P = 0.011) in the deep, thermally stratified enclosures. On average, total algal biomass in the nutrient and fish treatments was 2.6 times higher than in the nutrient-only treatments. In contrast, in the shallow enclosures, total phytoplankton biomass increased with nutrient additions (P = 0.04) but was not significantly affected by the addition of fish (P = 0.34). However fish additions increased the number of algal cells in both the shallow and deep enclosures, independently of nutrients, because of an increase in small cells: the proportion of nanoplankton cells was significantly greater in the presence of fish. Fertilization increased the large nanoplankton fraction (10-20 mu m) in the deep enclosures, but had no significant effect on the size distribution of algal biomass in the shallow enclosures. In general, large (>64 mu m) cells were a minor component of the phytoplankton biomass in ail treatments. Fertilization stimulated the growth of Chlorophyta in the deep (P = 0.018) and in the shallow (P = 0.012) enclosures, Cyanobacteria were conspicuous in the fertilized shallow enclosures, but the effect on total biomass was not statistically significant. The presence of fish stimulated a significant increase in Cryptophyta at both depths and Pyrrophyta were more common.
   Nutrients and planktivorous fish had different effects on phytoplankton depending on the thermal regime. In terms of total algal biomass there was no significant difference between deep and shallow enclosures within a given treatment, but depth did affect the size distribution of algal biomass among treatments. The effects of fish were more evident with community structure variables (size or taxonomic distribution) than with coarser variables such as algal biomass.

AB Although pollination effectiveness is a central process underlying the evolution of plant and pollinator traits, it is difficult to measure and has rarely been reported for a diverse spectrum of visitors under natural conditions. We measured the effectiveness of all common flower visitors to Asclepias tuberosa (butterfly weed) at a site in southeastern Arizona, in terms of visitation rate, per-visit rate of pollinia removal and insertion, and pollinia load. Bombus and Apis (Hymenoptera) were the most effective pollinators, counter to predictions that A. tuberosa is butterfly pollinated. We also documented large differences between 2 yr in the pollination effectiveness of visitors, primarily due to changes in visitation rate. Bombus were the most frequent and effective pollinators in 1992. In 1993, Apis were equivalent to Bombus. Battus (Lepidoptera) were the second most effective pollinators in 1992, but were scarce in 1993. Thus, conclusions about the identity of effective pollinators based on floral traits, casual observations of visitation, or even precise measurement of effectiveness in a single season are all potentially suspect. We compare our results to those of previous studies of Asclepias pollination.

AB Nitrogen concentrations in green and senesced leaves of perennial desert shrubs were compiled from a worldwide literature search to test the validity of the doctrine that desert shrubs produce foliage and leaf litter much richer in nitrogen than that in the foliage of plants from more mesic environments. Mean nitrogen concentration in the green leaves of 78 species of shrubs growing in 11 deserts on five continents (2.2%) was not different from that in 67 species of trees and shrubs growing in deciduous, and mixed deciduous forests (2.2%), and only slightly higher than that in overstory (2.0%) and understory (2.1%) plants growing in tropical wet forest. Mean nitrogen concentration in the green leaves of a ubiquitous shrub that dominates large areas of desert in the United States (Larrea tridentata, 2.1%), and in the green-stem tissues of leafless desert shrubs (2.1%) were also similar to that in plants from mesic environments. Mean green-leaf nitrogen was similar in shrubs growing in different deserts. Mean nitrogen concentration in leaf litter was 1.1% for 11 species of desert shrubs, and 1.0% for the 10 species of this group that were not capable of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Both concentrations were lower than those routinely provided to describe nitrogen in the litter of desert shrubs (1.5-1.7%), and only slightly higher than the mean nitrogen concentration in 77 species of woody perennials growing in a wide variety of environments worldwide (0.9%). Nitrogen in the leaf litter of one desert shrub (0.4%, Brickellia laciniata) was nearly as low as the lowest leaf-litter nitrogen concentration known for any woody species (0.3%).
   Because nitrogen concentrations in the foliage of desert shrubs are not higher than those in plants growing in more mesic environments, the tenet that desert shrubs support extraordinarily nitrogen-rich foliage can no longer be supported.

AB The addition or deletion of a species from a community is likely to have effects on the trait values of other species and on their population densities. This article argues that current theory is insufficiently developed to provide guidance in predicting what might happen to either traits or population densities. In addition, there has been relatively little empirical work to examine many of the phenomena that have been predicted by the limited available theory. The example of character displacement of competitors is reviewed to reveal some of the gaps in our knowledge about the evolutionary consequences of additions or deletions. The example of evolution of traits related to predation in food webs is used to reveal gaps in our knowledge of the population-level consequences of evolutionary changes initiated by a species addition or deletion. Several approaches to studying combined evolutionary and ecological processes in multispecies communities are discussed. Some previous multispecies models have been too abstract to be easily related to more mechanistic two-species models, but recent methods derived from quantitative genetics may result in significant advances in understanding multispecies systems and their relationship to communities with fewer species.

AB Physical stress to seaweeds and hunger stress of herbivores can influence the outcome of chemically mediated seaweed-herbivore interactions. The unpalatable brown seaweed Dictyota ciliolata produces the diterpenoid secondary metabolites pachydictyol A, dictyol B acetate, and dictyodial. At natural concentrations, pachydictyol A deterred the sea urchin Arbacia punctulata but did not inhibit feeding by the pinfish Lagodon rhomboides or the amphipod Ampithoe longimana until concentrations were 2.5-5 times natural levels. Dictyol B acetate deterred the urchin, amphipod, and pinfish at, or far below, natural concentrations. Dictyodial was too unstable to assay directly, but indirect experiments suggested that natural concentrations deterred the urchin, but not the pinfish or amphipod. Mild desiccation of D. ciliolata reduced concentrations of the different secondary metabolites by 7-38% and plants became 2.6-3.4 times more susceptible to urchin and amphipod grazing. The combined concentrations of pachydictyol A and dictyol B acetate found in undesiccated Dictyota ciliolata deterred feeding by urchins, but this deterrent effect was lost at concentrations found in the desiccated plants. Desiccated and undesiccated plants did not differ in nutritive value (as measured by protein and total N content) or toughness. Thus, desiccated plants became more palatable because chemical defenses were lost, not because nutritive value was increased.
   The stress of near-surface ultraviolet radiation also caused significant physiological changes in Dictyota ciliolata. UV-exposed blades bleached, senesced, and grew 84% less than blades protected from UV radiation. Tissue loss and minimal growth of UV-stressed plants constrained our sample sizes, but the limited assays that could be run suggested that UV stress may lower chemical defenses and increase plant susceptibility to herbivores.
   Because many previous investigations of herbivore feeding patterns used animals that had been starved for days before an assay, we tested the effects of this commonly used procedure on feeding discrimination. Recently fed urchins always avoided food containing natural concentrations of pachydictyol A during separate feeding trials performed on each of four consecutive days. In contrast, urchins deprived of food for 3 d before this assay did not avoid the treated food on days 1 and 2 of feeding trials, but did avoid it on days 3 and 4 after their hunger was reduced by feeding during days 1 and 2. If we had used only starved urchins (a common procedure in previous investigations), we could have concluded, with apparent justification, that urchins were unaffected by pachydictyol A (if the assays were run for only 1-2 d) or that they needed 2 d of exposure to the compound in order to learn to avoid it. Both of these conclusions would have been incorrect.

AB While the role of parasites in shaping population and community dynamics has been increasingly appreciated, researchers have largely ignored the ecology of parasitic plants. Parasitic plants obtain water, sugar, nitrogen compounds, and a variety of secondary metabolites from their host plants. In a greenhouse study, I examined the direct interactions of a parasitic plant, Castilleja wightii (Scrophulariaceae), with three plant hosts and the indirect effects of this parasitism on the performance of a parasite-feeding herbivore. The three host species, Lupinus arboreus, Artemisia pycnocephala, and Eriophyllum staechadifolium, directly and differentially affected C. wightii flower production, although parasite biomass was not affected by host species. Surprisingly, parasite performance was weakest when attacking a leguminous host, although parasite total nitrogen was highest when growing on a legume. Parasites also exerted a strong direct effect on host performance: host dry mass was negatively correlated with parasite mass for all three host species tested. However, this effect differed among hosts: for E. staechadifolium, proportionately larger parasite mass was correlated with smaller overall biomass of the host and parasite combined, while for the other two hosts, overall host-parasite mass was not correlated with parasite mass, indicating that E. staechadifolium was more affected by parasite attack than were the other host species. Finally, host plant chemistry had strong indirect effects on the performance of an aphid, Nearctaphis kachena, that feeds on C. wightii. Aphids feeding on C. wightii that were parasitizing L. arboreus (alkaloid-producing, high nitrogen), A. pycnocephala (alkaloid-free, intermediate nitrogen), and E. staechadifolium (terpenoid-producing, low nitrogen) experienced 68.2, 65.3, and 49.5% survival, respectively. Further, aphids feeding on parasites using L. arboreus and A. pycnocephala produced 2.43 and 1.77 times more offspring on average than those feeding on parasites using E. staechadifolium. My results indicate that interactions between plant parasites and different host species can have strong direct effects on both host and parasite performance, as well as marked effects on the tritrophic interactions among plant hosts, parasitic plants, and their herbivores.

AB Net accumulation rates of carbon in a 9000 calendar year record of Sphagnum fuscum peat in western boreal Canada range from 13.6 to 34.9 g . m(-2). yr(-1). The depth vs. age curve is slightly convex due to generally declining net productivity at the site. Fossil carbon/nitrogen ratios of bulk Sphagnum fuscum peat and its components are used to calculate the rate and total amount of decay in the deeper anoxic peat deposits. The proportional rate of decay in the catotelm of the peatland declines linearly over lime. Carbon loss from the catotelm is estimated at 50% after 1700 calendar years and 65% after 7500 calendar years. Carbon has been added to the catotelm at an average rate of 28.0 g . m(-1). yr(-1) over the last 1174 years, whereas, at present, the cumulative loss of carbon over the entire catotelm is 19.4 g . m(-2). yr(-1). The peatland continues to represent a sink for carbon.

AB Forest models based on the gap dynamics hypothesis (''gap models'') have gained an important role in forest ecology and have grown rather complex in the last 20 yr. They have been applied extensively to study the impacts of climatic change on ecosystems although they originally were not built for this purpose.
   The objectives of this study were (1) to develop a new forest gap model, FORCLIM, that includes only a minimum number of ecological assumptions but robust parameterizations of the effects of climate on plant population dynamics; (2) to test the realism of FORCLIM as compared to its predecessor model, FORECE; and (3) to examine the behavior of FORECE and FORCLIM systematically along climate gradients in Europe.
   FORCLIM is composed of three modular submodels: FORCLIM-P for plant population dynamics, FORCLIM-S for soil carbon/nitrogen turnover, and FORCLIM-E for providing reliable parameterizations of the abiotic environment. For the core model, FORCLIM-P, it was found that only four factors are sufficient to model tree growth, another four factors are required to model tree establishment, and only two factors are required to model tree mortality.
   The behavior of FORCLIM was tested at a large number of sites in the European Alps. The model yields tree species compositions that conform to field data and are very similar to those of the predecessor model. Based on this evaluation alone, it would not be possible to favor one of the models over the other.
   The behavior of both models then was examined systematically in a parameter space spanned by the annual mean temperature and the annual precipitation sum. From this exercise it became evident;hat both the pattern of aboveground biomass and the realized niches of the dominating tree species are simulated realistically by FORCLIM. Extremely steep gradients are characteristic of FORECE, and many ecotones are simulated to occur in the wrong places in FORECE.
   Thus, some of the current forest gap models can be simplified without reducing the realism of their behavior, and models other than FORECE should be scrutinized in this respect as well. The present study also suggests that the evaluation of model behavior at scattered sites is insufficient to show their validity for simulating forest dynamics along climate gradients. Further rigorous model comparisons and validation studies are required to increase the reliability of this promising class of models.

AB We studied plant survival and colonization over an experimental gradient, from fire lightly scorching the soil to fire consuming most of the organic soil layer, at two forest sites in northern Sweden. The gradient was achieved by adding different amounts of fuel to small plots that were burned in 1988 and 1989. Temperature was recorded at four soil strata during burning. We analyzed survival of seeds and rhizomes in the soil immediately after fire, and followed vegetation cover and seedling establishment until 1993.
   During fire, there was a steep decline in maximum temperature with increasing depth below the char, irrespective of the depth of burn in the mor layer, indicating that burn depth can be used as a general indicator of heat impact below ground. Lethal temperature was not recorded deeper than 20-30 mm under the burn boundary. Plant survival was determined both by depth of burn and by depth distribution of regenerative structures in the soil. Three rhizomatous species, the dwarf shrubs Vaccinium myrtillus and Vaccinium vitis-idaea and the grass Deschampsia flexuosa, were dominant in the prefire vegetation. For all three species, the bulk of the soil bud bank was located within the mor layer, but was more superficial for D. flexuosa. Initial mortality in the bud bank was progressively higher with increasing depth of burn, and this determined the regrowth over the following years. After fires that consumed only the moss layer, cover of the Vaccinium species returned to prefire levels within 2-4 yr, and D. flexuosa showed a dramatic increase in cover as well as in fruiting. Fires that burned slightly deeper nearly eliminated D. flexuosa, and the deepest burning fires also eliminated Vaccinium spp. In contrast to regrowth from rhizomes, colonization from seed was better after relatively deep-burning fire, both for species with a soil seed bank and for species dispersing seed onto the burnt soil. However, after fires consuming most of the organic soil layer, seed bank species were also badly affected, whereas dispersers showed progressively better establishment with increasing depth of burn.
   Differences between treatments were still great after 5 yr, indicating that variation in depth of burn will have a long-lasting impact on the vegetation. These results from experimentally burned plots were corroborated by an analysis of depth distribution of viable plant rhizomes and seeds, and the initial colonization at a site newly burned in a wildfire.
   The precise response patterns of boreal vegetation to variation in burn depth will depend on characteristics of the species present. However, we assume that these results have a high degree of generality, since, in podzolized soils, most rhizomatous species are predominantly located in the mor layer, since the dormant seed bank typically is concentrated at the interface of mor and mineral soil, and also since a thick organic soil layer is a poor seedbed for incoming seeds. The results indicate that in boreal forest, depth of burn is a more important variable than fire front intensity for the understory vegetation, in contrast to the situation in ecosystems with little accumulation of organic material on the mineral soil.

AB Annual local survival of adult Greater Flamingos, Phoenicopterus ruber roseus, breeding at their natal colony in the Camargue (southern France), was studied using ringed birds observed at the colony from 1983 to 1991. Survival and probability of resighting were estimated separately, using capture-recapture models. Because all the birds we observed were nesting, differences in probability of resighting reflect differences in probability of breeding. Winter severity significantly affected survival. Annual local survival was 93% during normal years, but in 1984-1985, following a severe cold spell, survival fell to 76%. Sex and age (range 4 to 14 yr old) had no significant effect on survival. Resighting rates varied between 11% and 88% during the study period. There were significant additive effects of year, sex, and age on resighting rates. The probability of resighting increased with age in both males and females, reflecting the progressive access to regular reproductive status in this population. However, males had a higher probability of being resighted than females, probably due to their higher rates of mate switching and renesting following breeding failure.

AB We studied canopy gaps over a range of stand ages and site moisture classes in the temperate rain forest of Clayoquot Sound, southwestern British Columbia, Canada. We tested predictions about the landscape mosaic at three levels of resolution: the forest as a whole, gaps, and gapmakers. In addition to canopy gaps arising from the patchy mortality of dominant trees (developmental gaps), we described the prevalence and characteristics of gaps arising from edaphic and topographic features, Roughly 56% of the forest area is influenced to some degree by canopy openings (canopy gap + expanded gap), with 30% of forest area in canopy gaps averaged over all sites (14% developmental canopy gaps and 16% in edaphic canopy gaps). Within the most intensively sampled biogeoclimatic subzone, 73% of gaps were developmental in origin. The majority of edaphic gaps result from streamcourses. Though percent area in developmental canopy gaps was similar across stand age classes, gaps and gapmakers were more common in old growth than in mature stands.
   Most developmental gaps resulted from the mortality of more than one tree: 96% of the developmental gaps had more than one gapmaker, and 50% had three or more, Mature stands had a significantly higher number of gapmakers per gap than old-growth stands. Old-growth forests were thus dominated by many small gaps and mature forests by fewer larger gaps. Drier and wetter sites had more gapmakers per gap than did stands on mesic sites. The number of decay classes of gapmakers in developmental gaps increases with number of gapmakers per gap, indicating that larger gaps represent the combined effects of distinct mortality events separated in time, rather than single large events. Gapmakers in developmental gaps were distributed broadly and evenly over the range of decay classes, suggesting a continuous pattern of recruitment of gapmakers rather than larger episodic mortality events. The snapping of boles and standing death were the most common modes of gapmaker mortality, together accounting for 76% of the mortality of all gapmakers. Uprooting was the least common mode of gapmaker mortality in both mature and old-growth forests (23.6% and 15.6%, respectively; 20.6% of all gapmakers) and uprooting was more common in drier and wetter sites than in mesic sites.
   These general trends in gap-phase structure and gap formation processes are consistent with data on gaps and forest age structure collected elsewhere on the British Columbia coast, suggesting that a regime of small-scale, low-intensity disturbance is common in the old-growth forests of coastal British Columbia. We estimate that, in the absence of large-scale disturbances, turnover time for this forest is between 350 and 950 yr, resulting in ubiquitous late successional character throughout the landscape mosaic. Silvicultural practices intended to emulate the natural disturbance regime of these forests should create small gaps of 3-10 trees in an otherwise continuous forest matrix and should retain substantial late-successional characteristics within managed forests.

AB Although seasonal migrations of large predatory mammals that follow migrating prey are well documented, no equivalent phenomenon has been described previously in terrestrial reptiles. We surveyed and radio-tracked water pythons (Liasis fuscus) in Fogg Dam and its adjacent floodplain in the wet-dry tropics of northern Australia to document patterns of movement, with particular emphasis on the ways in which the snakes exploit their major prey species, the dusky rat (Rattus colletti). The distribution and abundance of these rodents vary seasonally. During the dry season the rats live in soil crevices in the floodplain, but wet-season flooding forces them to higher ground, primarily to natural levee banks. Python and rat abundances on the floodplain adjacent to Fogg Dam were significantly correlated through time: both reached a maximum during the dry season, and fell dramatically during the wet season. Activity of pythons was centered around Fogg Dam during the dry season, but all of the radio-tracked snakes moved away from this area during the wet season. Most pythons migrated to the vicinity of levee banks on the floodplain up to 12 km away from their dry-season range. By migrating seasonally, water pythons can efficiently utilize a migratory prey species that would otherwise be unavailable for much of the year.

AB Monitoring long-term population change is an integral part of effective conservation-oriented research and management, and is central to the current debate on the status of Neotropical migrant land birds. However, the analysis of count data such as the Breeding Bird Survey is complicated by the subjective nature of trend estimation, and by limitations inherent to extensive, volunteer-based surveys, such as measurement error and missing data. A number of analysis methods have been used that differ in their approach to dealing with these complications and produce different estimates of population change when applied to the same data. There is, however, no consensus as to which method is the most suitable. Many analytical issues remain unresolved, such as model of trend, observer effects, treatment of missing observations, distribution of counts, and data selection criteria. These issues make it difficult to evaluate the relative merits of the methods, although a number of new approaches (nonlinear regression, Poisson regression, estimating equations estimates) offer promising solutions to some problems. I suggest the use of Monte Carlo simulations to empirically test the performance of the methods under realistic, spatially explicit scenarios of population change, and provide an example of the approach.

AB Grazing by the generalist amphipod Ampithoe longimana induced increased concentrations of defensive secondary metabolites in the brown alga Dictyota menstrualis and made the seaweed less susceptible to further attack by the amphipod. Although A. longimana preferentially consumes D. menstrualis, its feeding rates can be reduced significantly by high concentrations of diterpenoid dictyols produced by the alga. In 1991, D. menstrualis from sites with high numbers of A. longimana had higher levels of grazing scars, higher concentrations of dictyols, and were less palatable to A. longimana than plants from sites with few amphipods. Among-site differences in palatability to amphipods did not correlate with plant differences in protein, nitrogen, or carbon content. Within a site, plants that had apparent amphipod grazing scars were significantly less palatable to A. longimana than neighboring undamaged plants. Controlled field experiments manipulating A. longimana densities supported the hypothesis that feeding by this amphipod induced elevated chemical defenses in the alga. Compared to undamaged control plants, amphipod-damaged plants had 19-34% more of three diterpenoid secondary metabolites and were 50% less palatable to amphipods. Soluble protein and thallus toughness were unaffected by amphipod grazing and thus could not have caused the differences in palatability. High-pressure liquid chromatography evaluation of adventitious branches growing from blade margins at sites of amphipod grazing scars showed that these branches had significantly elevated levels of two diterpenoids relative to normal blade apices or middles. Thus, the amphipod-induced resistance to further attack occurs through an increase in chemical defenses, and these defenses are, to some extent, localized within the plant thallus. Among-site differences in amphipod densities, grazing scars, seaweed defensive chemistry, and plant palatability that we documented in 1991 varied considerably during 1992 and 1993, suggesting that these interrelationships may be complex. In 1992, A. longimana densities did not differ between sites, and there were no between-site differences in palatability or concentrations of deterrent secondary metabolites. In 1993, however, A. longimana densities did differ between sites, but between-site differences were less dramatic than in 1991. Some secondary metabolites were slightly, but significantly, increased at the site with higher densities of A. longimana, but this had no effect on A. longimana feeding.
   It has been long recognized that marine herbivores are active participants in seaweed-herbivore interactions and can greatly influence the structure of benthic algal communities. Our findings suggest that seaweeds are not passive participants in these interactions, but can actively alter their susceptibility to herbivores in ecological time. Induced responses to herbivory help explain both spatial (i.e., within-thallus, within-site, and among-site) and temporal variation in the chemical defenses of D. menstrualis.

AB The foraging of female Thomson's gazelles (Gazella thomsoni) on shortgrass plains was monitored over one annual cycle in southwestern Kenya. Sward dry green biomasses and protein densities were estimated regularly throughout the study site. Changes in protein densities with season and locale were strongly correlated with underlying changes in grass physiognomy: sward height and dry green bulk biomass density were particularly important and were found to vary inversely. The relationship between bite rates and underlying sward parameters varied with season: gazelle bite rates in the dry season were positively correlated with underlying dry green biomass and protein densities, as predicted by either the Process 1 or Process 2 foraging model of Spalinger and Hobbs. Nonlinear regressions of within-bout bite rates on these model equations significantly explained 21.8 and 23.7% of the dry season variance, respectively. In contrast, bite rates in the early wet season showed significant negative correlations with underlying protein densities: the fit of the within-bout bite rate data to Spalinger and Hobbs' Process 3 model explained 18.4% of the overall variation. The late wet season showed a flat (insignificant) relationship between bite rates and protein levels and was thus intermediate between early wet- and later dry-season patterns. Logistic regression of the type of correlation between bite rate and protein density (positive, flat, negative) on two principal components of grass physiognomy suggested that a component heavily weighting sward height was the major correlate of foraging process, whereas a second major component heavily weighting bulk density and other grass quality measures was less critical. At least during this single annual cycle, shorter swards were associated with Processes 1 or 2, whereas taller swards showed Process 3 foraging. One interpretation of these results is that sward height modulates bite mass, which in turn plays the major role in controlling foraging process. Whether the switching point remains the same in subsequent years or not, the results make it clear that the direction of the bite rate vs. foraging density relationship can change markedly with season, as predicted by the Spalinger and Hobbs models.

AB Circumstantial evidence suggests that Artemisia tridentata may out-compete Pinus ponderosa and P. jefferyi for water at ecotones between shrub steppe and montane forest vegetation in the Great Basin. Other studies indicate that within the shrub steppe Artemisia may act as a nurse plant for a third species of pine, P. monophylla. We used field experiments to study these contrasting effects of Artemisia on P, ponderosa and P. monophylla within the contest of the distributional patterns in western Nevada of all three species on andesite, and on sites where hydrothermal activity has altered the andesite. At intermediate elevations in the Great Basin Artemisia and P. monophylla are restricted to unaltered desert soils, whereas P. ponderosa is restricted to acidic, nutrient-poor altered andesite. Although mature P. monophylla were virtually absent in our study plots on altered andesite, first- and second-year seedlings were common. On adjacent unaltered andesite, all size classes of P. monophylla occurred, and P. monophylla seedlings were associated with Artemisia shrubs. Pinus ponderosa and P. jefferyi adults and seedlings were rare on unaltered andesite, but a wide range of size classes was found on altered andesite. In experiments, all P. ponderosa seedlings on unaltered andesite were consumed by predators regardless of positive or negative spatial association with shrubs. Of the P, monophylla seedlings that germinated on unaltered andesite, all that were under shrubs survived, but only 6% of those that germinated in the intershrub spaces survived, On the open altered andesite the mortality of P. monophylla seedlings due to abiotic stress was high, with a final survival of only 3%, whereas 25% of P, ponderosa seedlings survived the iir-st growing season on altered andesite. On unaltered andesite, survival and conductance of P. ponderosa saplings was enhanced by shrub removal, but P. monophylla survival was significantly higher under shrubs than in shrub-removal plots or in intershrub spaces, In Artemisia-removal experiments, we found that Artemisia competed with P. ponderosa seedlings and saplings for water. Removal of Artemisia decreased water use efficiency (WUE) of P. monophylla seedlings. The absence of Artemisia may restrict Pinus monophylla from out-crops of altered andesite in the Great Basin, but provide refuges for P. ponderosa.

AB Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the postburn flush of seedlings in the chaparral; these include direct effects of fire, such as heating, of the soil and seed bank, and indirect effects of fire, such as a temporary reduction in competition by shrubs or herbivory by mammals. I conducted an experiment in burned and adjacent unburned chaparral to assess the relative importance of these mechanisms to seedling emergence and mortality of four functional plant groups: shrubs, subshrubs, perennial herbs, and annual herbs. I assessed direct effects of burning by comparing experimental plots in a burned area to plots in adjacent, unburned chaparral that were cleared of shrubs. In the unburned chaparral, competition with shrubs was manipulated by removing aboveground vegetation; herbivory by large mammals was manipulated using fence exclosures. The direct effects of burning enhanced emergence of shrub and subshrub seedlings, but reduced emergence of annual herbs. Shrub removal alone did not affect seedling emergence, but did improve survivorship of annuals. Exclusion of mammalian herbivores improved the survivorship of annual herbs and all seedlings combined. No single factor explained the high abundance of perennial herbs in the burn area; my results suggest that the combined removal of shrubs and herbivores following fire enhanced their growth and establishment. Thus, both the direct and indirect effects of fire contributed to the high postburn recruitment of seedlings in maritime chaparral, but different mechanisms were responsible for the increase in specific plant groups.

AB Experiments were conducted to compare the patterns, mechanisms, and costs of predator avoidance behavior among larvae of five species of mayflies that co-occur with the predatory stoneflies, Megarcys signata and Kogotus modestus in western Colorado streams. Mayfly drift dispersal behavior, use of high vs. low food (periphyton or detritus) patches, microhabitat use, positioning, and activity periodicity were observed in the presence and absence of predators in circular flow-through chambers using natural stream water. Also, distances from predators at which prey initiated escape responses were compared among prey and predator species. Costs of predator avoidance behavior were assessed by measuring short-term (24-h) feeding rates of mayflies in the presence or absence of predatory stoneflies whose mouthparts were immobilized (glued) to prevent feeding.
   The intensity and associated costs of predator avoidance behavior of mayfly species were consistent with their relative rates of predation by stoneflies. Megarcys consumes overwintering generation Baetis bicaudatus > Epeorus longimanus > Cinygmula = Ephemerella; Kogotus consumes summer generation Baetis > Epeorus deceptivus = Cinygmula; Megarcys eats more mayflies than Kogotus. While Megarcys induced drift by Baetis, Epeorus, and Cinygmula, this disruptive predator avoidance behavior only reduced food intake by Baetis and Epeorus. The morphologically defended mayfly species, Ephemerella, neither showed escape behavior from Megarcys, nor any cost of its antipredatory posturing behavior. Only Baetis responded by drifting from Kogotus. No mayfly species shifted microhabitats or spent less time on high-food patches in the presence of foraging stoneflies. However, predators enhanced the nocturnal periodicity of Baetis drift, which was negligible in the absence of stoneflies as long as food was abundant. Lack of food also caused some microhabitat and periodicity shifts and increased the magnitude of both day and night drift of Baetis. Thus, Baetis took more risks of predation by visual, drift-feeding fish not only in the presence of predatory stoneflies, but also when food was low or they were hungry. All other mayflies were generally nocturnal in their use of rock surfaces, as long as food was abundant. Finally, the distances at which different mayfly species initiated acute escape responses were also consistent with relative rates of predation.
   This study demonstrates alternative predator avoidance syndromes by mayfly species ranging from an initial investment in constitutive morphological defenses (e.g., Ephemerella) to induced, energetically costly predator avoidance behaviors (e.g., Baetis). Although the costs of Ephemerella's constitutive defense are unknown, experiments show that prey dispersal is the mechanism underlying fecundity costs of induced responses by Baetis to predators, rather than microhabitat shifts to less favorable resources or temporal changes in foraging activity. A conceptual model suggests that contrasting resource acquisition modes may account for the evolution and maintenance of alternative predator avoidance syndromes along a continuum from Baetis (high mobility) to heptageniids (intermediate mobility) to Ephemerella (low mobility). Prey dispersal (swimming) to avoid capture results in reduction of otherwise high fecundity by Baetis, which trades off morphological defense for enhanced ability to acquire resources. Thus, improved foraging efficiency is the selection pressure maintaining the highly mobile life style in Baetis, which increases resource acquisition and fecundity, offsetting the high mortality costs associated with this behavior.

AB Theoretical population models suggest that variation among individuals can affect population-level properties like stability and equilibrial density. Few studies, however, have tested the importance of individual variation to factors affecting population dynamics (e.g., average individual growth rates, developmental rates, survivorship, etc.) using natural populations. We conducted a field experiment designed to test effects of larval density and individual variability in body size on growth and development of larval tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum). We performed our experiment in a natural sinkhole lake in central Arizona; experimental populations differing in density and initial variability in body size were held in nylon mesh enclosures. Effects of individual variability in size were examined independently of any effects due to mean body size of the population or total population biomass. Density affected growth rates and development to metamorphosis of experimental larvae in a manner consistent with other studies. Initial variability in body size did not affect larval growth rates or diets but did interact with density to affect survivorship and development: experimental larvae held with similarly sized individuals experienced lower survivorship and were metamorphosing earlier than experimental larvae held with variably sized individuals. These effects did not appear to be mediated by size-specific competitive abilities but may have been mediated by individual behavioral responses to size structure. This study underscores the importance of incorporating information about interindividual variability into our understanding of processes affecting population dynamics.

AB We used laboratory experiments to show that the nonlethal presence of pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) results in smaller size at emergence, decreased growth and development rates, and lower fecundity of the dipteran Chironomus tentans. Smaller size at metamorphosis is often viewed as a cost of antipredator behavior. However, it may also partly result from a facultative change in life history in which prey increase their development rate to ''escape'' their risky larval habitat. To determine the mechanism responsible for this smaller size at emergence, we compared development rates of chironomid larvae raised in the absence and nonlethal presence of pumpkinseed sunfish. When we statistically controlled for effects of predators on larval growth rate, fish presence had no effect on development rate of female chironomids, but significantly slowed male development. These results clearly indicate that C. tentans does not increase its development rate as a means of escaping a risky habitat, and that smaller size at emergence is best viewed as a cost of larvae behaviorally avoiding fish predators. Observed sex differences in life history responses to predators may have important consequences for fitness.

AB This study examined the responses of ground-foraging ants to larval ant lions (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae). In central Oklahoma, these sit-and-wait arthropod predators are restricted by abiotic factors to sheltered cliff bases. A high-density ant lion zone forms an effective ''minefield'' of predation for local ant assemblages. The density of ant-nest entrances and the number of pitfall-trap captures of ant foragers were significantly lower in the ant lion zone than in the adjacent forest or grassland. Differences in ant abundance could not be attributed to differences in thermal microhabitat within and outside the ant lion zone. Over a 24-h period, ants foraged continuously at tuna-fish baits placed on the forest floor, but never utilized baits placed within the ant lion zone. Field behavioral tests with individual ant foragers confirmed that the risk of predation from ant lions was high for common ant species in the assemblage. Among species, predation risk was negatively correlated with worker body mass.
   Manipulative field experiments tested whether ants use biotic or abiotic cues to avoid ant lion aggregations. Ants foraged readily at baits on the forest floor and baits placed in the center of experimental sand patches, but they avoided baits placed in sand patches that contained ant lions. Ant foraging was also substantially lower in parches from which ant lions had been removed 3 h prior to the start of the experiment. Ant foraging was slightly reduced in patches with artificial ant lion pits that had never contained predators. These experiments suggest that ants use biotic cues associated with the presence or recent presence of predators. Previous studies have not implicated predation as an important factor structuring ant communities. This study suggests that predators can have important communitywide impacts on the distribution, abundance, and behavior of ground-foraging ants.

AB Analysis of mortality from a 25-yr sample of 380 Florida Scrub Jays, Aphelocoma c. coerulescens, shows that actuarial senescence (increase in mortality with age) occurs. This refutes the notion that adult mortality is independent of age in birds, and has important implications for evolutionary dynamics. We point to two major factors that may act to mask underlying patterns of actuarial senescence: (1) Selection through time (demographic heterogeneity): because selection inevitably weeds out lower quality individuals first, overall mortality may appear to be constant or even decreasing, despite an increasing force of mortality acting on birds of higher quality. (2) Conflicting processes: one source of mortality may act to decrease mortality over time (e.g., group size effects), while another acts to increase it (e.g., degenerative senescence). Age-specific data, measures of intrinsic quality that are independent of mortality, and exposure of sources of heterogeneity and of conflicting processes allow us to demonstrate a clear pattern of actuarial senescence in an unmanipulated, natural population of long-lived birds. The slow rate of increase in mortality is consistent with the hypothesis that mortality increases more slowly with age in birds than in mammals.

AB Predation risk influences differentially the foraging decisions of rodent species with different morphologies (body size and locomotion type), Explanations for different foraging patterns have been derived largely from the behavior of heteromyid rodents, and there is a lack of information regarding the behavior of other rodent groups with different morphologies. Nevertheless, the explanations are thought to be applicable to other groups. In order to study the generality of hypotheses about the effect of morphology on foraging ecology, I investigated the foraging decisions of Chilean sigmodontine rodents (Muridae) in the laboratory, experimentally manipulating nocturnal illumination (a surrogate of predation risk) and food distribution. Three coexisting rodent species from the Chilean matorral were compared: two quadrupeds, one with large body size (Phyllotis darwini) and another with small body size (Abrothrix olivaceus), and one small species with bipedal escape behavior (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus). The species did not differ in patch utilization and food consumption in response to different food distributions. However, there was an overall significant effect of illumination on food consumption. When illumination was higher, A. olivaceus and P. darwini increased food transportation to the refuge and decreased patch consumption and total food consumption. They also increased significantly the number of trips between food patch and refuge. P. darwini showed the most cautious foraging behavior. O. longicaudatus was insensitive to different conditions of illumination. It is argued that a large body size and quadrupedal locomotion seem to confer higher sensitivity to nocturnal illumination. Bipedality may confer less vulnerability to predation, and quadrupedal species show facultative central-place foraging, diminishing a possible greater vulnerability to potential risk, Former explanations for different foraging behaviors under the risk of predation may not be as general as previously assumed. This study emphasizes the need to consider the particular features of the system under investigation.

AB Alien plants invade many ecosystems worldwide and often have substantial negative effects on ecosystem structure and functioning. Our ability to quantitatively predict these impacts is, in part, limited by the absence of suitable plant-spread models and by inadequate parameter estimates for such models. This paper explores the effects of model, plant, and environmental attributes on predicted rates and patterns of spread of alien pine trees (Pinus spp.) in South African fynbos (a mediterranean-type shrubland).
   A factorial experimental design was used to: (1) compare the predictions of a simple reaction-diffusion model and a spatially explicit, individual-based simulation model; (2) investigate the sensitivity of predicted rates and patterns of spread to parameter values; and (3) quantify the effects of the simulation model's spatial grain on its predictions.
   The results show that the spatial simulation model places greater emphasis on interactions among ecological processes than does the reaction-diffusion model. This ensures that the predictions of the two models differ substantially for some factor combinations. The most important factor in the model is dispersal ability. Fire frequency, fecundity, and age of reproductive maturity are less important, while adult mortality has little effect on the model's predictions. The simulation model's predictions are sensitive to the model's spatial grain. This suggests that simulation models that use matrices as a spatial framework should ensure that the spatial grain of the model is compatible with the spatial processes being modeled.
   We conclude that parameter estimation and model development must be integrated procedures. This will ensure that the model's structure is compatible with the biological processes being modeled. Failure to do so may result in spurious predictions.

AB The cultivation of tropical Asian rice, which may have originated 9000 yr ago, represents an agricultural ecosystem of unrivaled ecological complexity. We undertook a study of the community ecology of irrigated tropical rice fields on Java, Indonesia, as a supporting study for the Indonesian National Integrated Pest Management Programme, whose purpose is to train farmers to be better agronomists and to employ the principles of integrated pest management (IPM). Two of our study objectives, reported on here, were (1) to explore whether there exist general and consistent patterns of arthropod community dynamics related to natural or intrinsic levels of biological control, and (2) to understand how the existing levels of biological control are affected by insecticide use, as well as by large-scale habitat factors relating to differing patterns for vegetational landscapes, planting times, and the length of dry fallow periods.
   We performed a series of observational studies and two experimental studies. Abundant and well-distributed populations of generalist predators can be found in most early-season tropical rice fields. We took samples from plants and water surface using a vacuum-suction device, and from the subsurface using a dip net. Our results show that high populations of generalist predators are likely to be supported, in the early season, by feeding on abundant populations of detritus-feeding and plankton-feeding insects, whose populations consistently peak and decline in the first third of the season. We hypothesize that since this abundance of alternative prey gives the predator populations a ''head start'' on later-developing pest populations, this process should strongly suppress pest populations and generally lend stability to rice ecosystems by decoupling predator populations from a strict dependence on herbivore populations.
   We experimentally tested our hypothesis of trophic linkages among organic matter, detritivores and plankton feeders, and generalist predators and showed that by increasing organic matter in test plots we could boost populations of detritivores and plankton-feeders, and in turn significantly boost the abundance of generalist predators. These results hold for populations found on the plant, on the water surface, and below the water surface. We also demonstrated the link between early-season natural enemy populations and later-season pest populations by experimentally reducing early-season predator populations with insecticide applications, causing pest populations to resurge later in the season.
   Overall, these results demonstrate the existence of a mechanism in tropical irrigated rice systems that supports high levels of natural biological control. This mechanism depends on season-long successional processes and interactions among a wide array of species, many of which have hitherto been ignored as important elements in a rice ecosystem. Our results support a management strategy that promotes the conservation of existing natural biological control through a major reduction in insecticide use, and the corresponding increase in habitat heterogeneity.

AB To elucidate ecological effects of variation in the temporal distribution of a limiting resource (water in the Mojave Desert), energetics of two free-living populations of desert tortoises (Gopherus [= Xerobates] agassizii) were studied concurrently over 18 mo with use of doubly-labeled water. Field metabolic rates (FMR) and feeding rates (estimated from rates of water influx and rates of change in dry mass) were highly variable. This variability was manifested at several levels, including seasonal changes within populations, year-to-year differences within populations, and differences between populations. Underlying observed patterns and contrasts was considerable variation among individuals. Much of the variation in energetic variables was associated with a single climatic variable, rainfall. Seasonal, annual, and interpopulation differences in FMR and foraging rates corresponded to differences in availability of free-standing water from rainstorms. At least some of the differences among individuals were apparently due to differences in proclivity or ability to drink. Tortoises had very low FMRs relative to other reptiles, which allowed them to tolerate long periods of chronic energy shortage during a drought. Calculations suggested that tortoises experienced a net loss of energy on their spring diet of succulent annual plants. If so, tortoises require drier forage to accrue an energy profit, which emphasizes their reliance on drinking rainwater (which can be stored in the bladder and resorbed later to hydrate dry forage). Further, it suggests that growth (as protein deposition) and net acquisition of energy may be temporally decoupled in desert tortoises, which has potential consequences for geographic variation in life history traits. Energy acquisition and expenditure in desert tortoises are thus strongly constrained by the contingencies of rainfall, both indirectly through effects on availability and quality of food, and directly through reliance on free-standing water for drinking, which is apparently necessary for achieving a net annual energy profit.

AB Despite broad consensus on the power of experiments, correlational studies are still important in ecology, and may become more so as spatial studies proliferate. Conventional correlation analysis, however, (1) fundamentally conflicts with the basic ecological concept of limiting factors, and (2) ignores spatial structure in data, which can produce spuriously high correlations. Especially for field data, bivariate scattergrams often show ''factor-ceiling'' distributions wherein data points are widely scattered beneath an upper limit, due to the action of other factors. Although most ecological information in such a graph resides in the upper limit, standard correlation/regression does not characterize such limits. If other factors have been measured, path analysis may be useful, but otherwise, direct description of ecological ceilings is desirable. Objective methods for doing so are barely known to ecologists; we review recent proposals for statistical testing and data display. For correcting correlations for spatial patchiness of the variables, another new technique has been proposed by Clifford, Richardson, and Hemon: by reducing the effective sample size to account for the autocorrelation it allows significance tests.
   We discuss these issues with reference to counts of glacier lily (Erythronium grandiflorum) seedlings, vegetative plants, and flowering plants in a square grid of 256 contiguous 2 x 2 m quadrats in subalpine meadow in western Colorado. We also measured soil moisture, pocket gopher activity, and soil rockiness. All six variables showed significant patchiness (spatial autocorrelation) at similar scales. The abundance of flowering plants was positively correlated with rockiness and negatively correlated with moisture and gopher activity. Although limited seed dispersal suggests that seedlings should be spatially associated with flowering plants, no such correlation existed: indeed, examination of the bivariate scatterplot suggests a negative association, in the particular and restricted sense that seedlings are abundant only in quadrats where flowering is low. We hypothesize that seed germination is higher in less rocky areas of deeper, moister soil than in the rocky areas where most seeds land, but that seedlings seldom reach maturity unless they are in a rocky refuge from predation. Results from path analysis are consistent with this hypothesis. Such an ecological situation should weaken natural selection on characters enhancing seed dispersal.

AB We investigated the effect of a native parasitic plant, Cuscuta salina, on the structure and dynamics of the plant community in a California salt marsh. Cuscuta was common in the middle marsh zones. The abundance of Cuscuta was positively correlated with the abundance of Limonium californicum at two sampling scales (0.25- and approximate to 40-m(2) quadrats). Sampling at the scale of individual plants indicated that the dominant plant in the marsh, Salicornia virginica, was preferred by Cuscuta as a host over Arthrocnemum subterminale, Limonium californicum, and Frankenia salina. This result was confirmed with host-choice experiments in the field.
   Based on spatial correlations and host-choice experiments, we hypothesized that Cuscuta indirectly facilitated Limonium and Frankenia, increasing plant diversity and initiating vegetation cycles. This hypothesis was supported by sampling patches with different histories of Cuscuta infection. Patches with recent heavy Cuscuta infection had reduced Salicornia biomass and increased Limonium and Frankenia biomass relative to controls. This effect was most pronounced at higher elevations and in larger, older patches. The hypothesis was also supported by sampling permanent quadrats repeatedly over time. The probability that Cuscuta would invade a quadrat increased with increasing cover of Salicornia. Quadrats containing Cuscuta increased in Limonium and Frankenia cover between censuses relative to quadrats lacking Cuscuta.
   Our results indicate that parasitic plants can have strong effects on the structure and dynamics of natural vegetation assemblages. However, these effects are mediated by physical and biological gradients across the landscape.

AB Researchers have been using simple morphological measures as indicators of ecological features for some time. The utility of morphological variables as ecological indicators depends upon our understanding of how the variable affects the ability of the organism to perform a particular task. Functional morphological analyses identify those features that can be directly related to behavioral performance and help to distinguish causal functional relationships from spurious correlations. The behavioral abilities of the individual, in turn, shape patterns of resource use and fitness by placing limits on the range of resources that can be utilized and by shaping the cost/benefit curve for resource choices. Examples from research on the feeding biology of North American sunfishes are discussed to illustrate how functional morphology can be used to provide explanations for differences between species in patterns of prey use, patterns of habitat use, ontogenetic diet switches, and population size. Trends from analyses of the evolution of fish feeding mechanisms suggest specific functional features that are most likely to vary among taxa and underlie differences in feeding performance and diet. Included in this group of predictive variables are the organization of lever arms in the jaw opening and closing systems, the size of the mouth, and the size of muscles used in prey-crushing behaviors. The link between morphology and ecology will be made most firmly when variables are chosen that clearly reflect the ability of the organism to perform relevant behaviors.

AB The relationship between mistletoes and birds has been studied from the perspectives of mutualism and seed dispersal. Here, we emphasize the role that avian dispersers play as agents of mistletoe seed transmission to plant hosts. We describe the patterns of transmission of the seeds of Tristerix aphyllus, an endophytic Chilean mistletoe, on two of its columnar cacti hosts (Eulychnia acida and Echinopsis skottsbergii) by the Chilean Mockingbird Mimus thenca. In north-central Chile, these cacti grow in relatively discrete subpopulations on north-facing slopes. We measured variation in seed transmission within 10 subpopulations varying in species composition, host density, parasite density, parasite prevalence (defined as the percentage of hosts infested in a given population), and disperser abundance. Seed transmission was independent of species, but was strongly dependent on prior parasitism. Parasitized individuals received seeds much more frequently than expected from their relative abundance. We found no correlation between the density of hosts and seed transmission. We found strong positive correlations, however, between parasite prevalence and seed transmission to both parasitized and nonparasitized hosts. Seed transmission of T. aphyllus seeds by M. thenca appeared to be frequency- rather than density-dependent. Seed transmission was also tightly and positively correlated with the abundance of seed-dispersing birds at each site. Because bird abundance and parasite prevalence were correlated, we conducted path analysis to disentangle their relative effect on seed transmission. A model including only the direct effect of bird abundance and the indirect effect of parasite prevalence through bird abundance explained roughly the same variance as a full model including both the direct and indirect effects of bird abundance and prevalence on seed transmission. Apparently, variation in bird abundance was the main determinant of variation in transmission. We suggest that mistletoes, host plants, and the birds that disperse mistletoe seeds are systems well suited for studies of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of disease transmission.

AB The realized dispersion patterns of marine invertebrate larvae were examined in the field for a range of larval types that differ in their potential for dispersal. Plankton samples were collected near three subtidal rock walls over a 2-yr period. Larvae of sessile invertebrates were identified and counted in each sample and analyzed for density differences among: (1) three distances from the rock surface; 1-5 cm, 1 m, and >200 m, (2) 1-5 cm above crustose coralline algae-covered surfaces and 1-5 cm over invertebrate-covered surfaces and, (3) 1-5 cm and 1 m from rock surfaces on days of high flow speed vs. days of low flow.
   Larvae with short dispersal times, such as ascidian tadpole larvae and hydroid actinula larvae, were more abundant 1-5 cm away from rock walls than 1 or >200 m away from rock surfaces. They were usually more abundant over invertebrate-covered surfaces than over crustose coralline algae-covered surfaces as well. Larvae with long planktonic dispersal times, but which were competent to settle (e.g., mussel pediveligers) were more abundant 1-5 cm away from rock walls than at 1 or >200 m away from rock walls. These larvae were often more abundant over invertebrate-covered surfaces than over crustose algae-covered surfaces also. Larvae with long planktonic dispersal times, but which were not competent to settle (e.g., Anemia veligers and mussel veliconcha-stage veligers) had similar densities at all distances from rock surfaces. These larvae occurred at similar densities over both invertebrate-covered surfaces and crustose algae-covered surfaces.
   Larvae that exhibited differences in density with distance from vertical walls, such as ascidian larvae, mussel pediveligers, and hydroid actinula larvae, were more thoroughly mixed into the mainstream flow away from rock surfaces on days of high flow compared to days of low-how conditions.

AB The hypothesis that Neotropical migrant birds may be undergoing widespread declines due to land use activities on the breeding grounds has been examined primarily by synthesizing results from local studies. Growing concern for the cumulative influence of land use activities on ecological systems has heightened the need for large-scale studies to complement what has been observed at local scales. We investigated possible landscape effects on Neotropical migrant bird populations for the eastern United States by linking two large-scale inventories designed to monitor breeding-bird abundances and land use patterns. The null hypothesis of no relation between landscape structure and Neotropical migrant abundance was tested by correlating measures of landscape structure with bird abundance, while controlling for the geographic distance among samples.
   Neotropical migrants as a group were more ''sensitive'' to landscape structure than either temperate migrants or permanent residents. Neotropical migrants tended to be more abundant in landscapes with a greater proportion of forest and wetland habitats, fewer edge habitats, larger forest patches, and with forest habitats well dispersed throughout the scene. Permanent residents showed few correlations with landscape structure and temperate migrants were associated with habitat diversity and edge attributes rather than with the amount, size, and dispersion of forest habitats. The association between Neotropical migrant abundance and forest fragmentation differed among physiographic strata, suggesting that landscape context affects observed relations between bird abundance and landscape structure. Finally, associations between landscape structure and temporal trends in Neotropical migrant abundance were counter to those observed in space. Trends in Neotropical migrant abundance were negatively correlated with forest habitats. These results suggest that extrapolation of patterns observed in some landscapes is not likely to hold regionally, and that conservation policies must consider the variation in landscape structure associations observed among different types of bird species and in physiographic strata with varying land use histories.

AB The timing of fruit initiation and the proximity of fruits to resources influence the probability of fruit and seed initiation in many hermaphroditic plants. In two populations of Aquilegia caerulea, both fruit and seed set decreased significantly between early and late flowers. Low fruit and seed set of late flowers was not due to pollen limitation. Fruit and seed set of late flowers remained low when extra pollen was added to these flowers (pollen quantity), or when all flowers on an inflorescence received self or outcross pollen (pollen quality). While competition for resources occurred among flowers, resource limitation Was not responsible for the low fruit and seed set of late flowers. Indeed, preventing pollination of late flowers significantly increased both fruit and seed set of early flowers. but fruit and seed set of late flowers remained low when early flowers were prevented from setting fruits. Late flowers were not just smaller or larger replicates of early flowers, as they allocated more reproductive resources to male function relative to early flowers. Neither herbivory nor architectural constraints could explain the low fruit and seed set of late flowers. While previously published adaptive explanations proposed to explain the low fruit and seed set of late flowers have emphasized a positive aspect to female reproductive success, it is suggested here that both malt and female functions should be considered. Morphological data and estimates of male and female reproductive success demonstrate how, both morphologically and functionally, late flowers on inflorescences of A. caerulea specialize as males, early flowers as females. It will be argued that protandry in this sequential bloomer is expected to select for an increase in relative male allocation between early and late Hewers, and that the observed pattern of resource allocation and the decrease in fruit and seed set between early and late flowers is consistent with this prediction.

AB We performed reciprocal transplants of different Borrichia clones between offshore islands in Pinellas County, Florida, to assess the relative strengths of environment and genotype on the success of the gall midge Asphondylia borrichiae. We measured gall abundance, gall size, gall abortion rate, parasitism rate, stem-tip diameter, nitrogen level, and parasitoid community composition from both experimental and native plants. We found a significant effect of plant clone and environment on all these variables with the exception of gall abortion rate. The effect of environment was usually stronger than that of genotype. This is an unusual result. At sites with higher densities of galls, plants were higher in nitrogen, had bigger stem tips, and produced larger galls. Bigger galls suffered lower parasitism because the smallest species of the parasitoid guild, which is also the most common species, was largely excluded from large galls. The interaction between plant clone and environment was significant for all variables, including abortion rate, which indicates that plant responses, herbivore density, and herbivore mortality are phenotypically plastic. while some authors have found significant interactions between plant genotype and site on herbivore densities, the demonstration of similar phenomena on natural-enemy attack rates and abortion rates of galls is novel. at least for a natural system. In this system, ''bottom-up'' factors indirectly determine the strength of ''top-down'' central from parasitoids, by regulating the size of galls.

AB Researchers have suggested that species-community interactions determine invasion success. Therefore, it is likely that small biological differences between species interact with habitat characteristics to produce distinct patterns of distribution and abundance throughout a new range. In this study we test the hypothesis that differences in the distribution and abundance of species sharing an identical set of ''ideal weed characteristics'' are explicable in terms of species-specific responses to environmental variation within their new range. Using multifactor experiments, we investigated some of the ecological interactions influencing reproductive success in two very closely related species of annuals having invaded the French Mediterranean region for >150 yr and showing marked differences in their local distribution and abundance patterns. We transplanted seedlings of Conyza canadensis (a species restricted to recently disturbed areas) and C. sumatrensis (a species colonizing early- to mid-successional old fields) at equal densities in three contrasting old fields (6 mo, 4 yr, 17-yr abandonment, respectively) during 1991-1992, a growing season with average rainfall. Individual performances (measured as survivorship, reproductive timing, and reproductive output) were evaluated with respect to: (1) competition with plant neighbors (tested with a weeding treatment), (2) resource availability (tested with nutrient and water addition), and (3) herbivory (tested with chemical limitation). Manipulated factors interacted in a rather complex fashion to influence survivorship and reproduction in both species. However, patterns of relative performance were consistent with relative distribution patterns across Mediterranean landscapes: C. sumatrensis performed better than C. canadensis in all fields, including the youngest one (6 mo old). Herbivory only slightly affected transplant performances. In contrast, competition with plant neighbors had substantial effects on either Conyza species and may be the most important determinant of performance in Mediterranean old fields. The experiment showed unambiguously that the two species differ markedly in their competitive ability, with C. sumatrensis performing better than C. canadensis in the presence of neighboring vegetation. In addition, C. sumatrensis displayed a superior ability to take up and/or to use water and nutrient resources when they become available in competitive environments. We argue that potential physiological or anatomical species differences responsible for this differential susceptibility to local resource reduction by neighbors could involve differences in constructional organization, leaf morphology, and reproductive phenologies.

AB Field measurements of maximum net photosynthesis (P-max), leaf nitrogen (N) content (leaf N per area and percent N), and specific leaf area (SLA) were made for Amazonian tree species within and across early successional sites of known ages after abandonment from slash-and-burn agriculture. We examined five species across a successional sere near San Carlos de Rio Negro, Venezuela, to test whether plasticity was associated with successional status and to determine whether changes in foliar properties during secondary succession can be attributed to shifts in species composition, in resource availability, or both. Average leaf N concentration was high (nearly 3%) for a pioneer species (Cecropia ficifolia) early in succession (1-3 yr after abandonment) but was always lower for the other early and mid- to-late succession species, especially later in succession (1-2% at 5-10 yr after abandonment). Net photosynthetic capacity (P-max/area and P-max/mass) varied as much as sixfold, being higher in pioneer species such as Cecropia and Vismia on recently abandoned sites and lower in late successional species such as Miconia and Licania on 10-yr abandoned agricultural sites. Total daily light availability also varied widely (14-fold) from its peak 1 yr after farm abandonment to low levels 9 yr into succession.
   During the first 5 yr of secondary succession, there were significant (P < 0.05) differences in P-max and leaf N concentration among species in any given year. In most species, P-max values declined with increasing time since abandonment within any given site. There were important differences in photosynthetic plasticity among species: P-max tended to be much greater in earlier than later successional species soon after abandonment. Also, the difference in P-max among species narrowed (or reversed) over time since abandonment, largely because of decreasing P-max in pioneer species. The results suggest that changes in both species composition and in resource availability combine to produce the common pattern of decreasing leaf N concentration and photosynthetic rates during early rain forest succession after agriculture.
   Early successional species showed strong (r(2) greater than or equal to 0.57, P = 0.0001) mass-based photosynthesis-N relationships but weak (r(2) = 0.40 or lower, P = 0.0001) area-based relationships both across the secondary successional sere after agriculture and across sites varying in types of disturbance. Both mass- and area-based photosynthesis-N relationships were poorer or not significant (P > 0.05) for mid- to late-successional species. Higher instantaneous P-max/N and greater slopes of the photosynthesis-N relationships in early than late successional species suggest that pioneer species may show greater carbon assimilation capacity with elevated leaf N concentration on early successional sites than co-occurring species. The data suggest that early and late successional species may differ in the mode and degree of leaf-level physiological plasticity across succession.

AB We have conducted a test of Hubbell's nonequilibrium model of tropical forest dynamics and found that it fails to account for high levels of compositional similarity in disjunct samples of floodplain forest in the Manu River basin of southeastern Peru.
   In describing how the composition of a tropical forest would change over many tree generations in the absence of density dependence, Hubbell's model, as presented, is untestable. However, by substituting space for time, it can be tested.
   Here we take advantage of the meandering of the Manu River to generate independently replicated, primary-successional chronosequences which culminate in tall, ''mature-phase'' forests possessing a characteristic complex vertical structure. By the logic of the nonequilibrium hypothesis, spatially uncorrelated forests should show uncorrelated species abundances. We tested this prediction by examining the compositional similarity of 1000-tree samples in four types of comparisons: (1) between nearby (potentially spatially correlated) and remote (presumably uncorrelated) plots of mature floodplain forest, (2) between real and synthetic forests generated by scrambling the relative abundances of the species, (3) between successional stages and the ''mature phase'' of floodplain forest, and (4) between mature floodplain forest and adjacent upland forest on a different soil type.
   In all comparisons, five mature floodplain-forest plots showed higher levels of similarity inter se than to any of the other real or synthetic forests. The 10 most abundant species in the three potentially spatially correlated plots appeared prominently in the 10 top ranks of two remote plots located 30 and 39 km to the east. The probability of obtaining the observed result under the expectation of the nonequilibrium hypothesis was approximate to 10(-7). We conclude with a plea for the application of biological models to the problem of tropical forest tree diversity.

AB Animals generally exhibit preference from among the resources available to them. Preference data are compositional, since they describe the proportion of some resource, such as time or energy, which has been allocated to each option, and the sum of these proportions must be 1. The unit-sum constraint places a restriction on the types of analysis that are appropriate. The method of log ratios provides a transformation that leads to analyses in which the unit-sum constraint is automatically satisfied. This paper describes a form of log ratio analysis that allows estimation of the relative preferences for the options available and the influence on these preferences of the conditions under which the options are presented. The method is most suitable for application to data from controlled experiments in which options are presented in pairs, as equal availability of rile choices can best be achieved and standard regression techniques call be used to fit the proposed models. The proposed analysis is demonstrated by a simple example in which the main difficulty of log ratio analysis, namely, unutilized options, is addressed and overcome.

AB Dormant propagule pools may store potentially significant genetic variation that can influence the rate and direction of microevolution via directional selection, temporally fluctuating selection, and evolution of trait covariance between timing of emergence from the propagule pool and fitness characters expressed in the active population. The third process can interact with either of the first two to produce distinct effects. Each process can lead to a different distribution of genotypes and phenotypes between active and dormant subpopulations. We compared the phenotypic distributions of an important fitness character for individuals collected from active and diapausing subpopulations of a freshwater copepod, Diaptomus sanguineus, with a long-lived egg bank. The character, seasonal timing of the switch from production of immediately hatching eggs to diapausing eggs, determines the relative representation of copepods with different switch dates in future generations and is subject to fluctuating selection due to year-to-year changes in the timing and intensity of the seasonal onset of fish predation.
   The mean timing of diapause is significantly later in the season for copepods reared eggs than it is for copepods reared from individuals collected from the water column. Phenotypic variance for diapause timing does not differ between the two subpopulations. Within the sediment subpopulation, the distribution gf diapause timing depends upon two features of the diapausing eggs: (1) individuals originating from eggs near the sediment surface exhibit a slightly earlier switch date with greater phenotypic variance than individuals from deep in the sediments, and (2) individuals from eggs that hatched shortly after they were collected from sediments have a later seasonal switch to diapause than those that hatched later in time. We hypothesize that our results are explained bg adaptive covariance between traits that influences how long an egg spends in the sediments before hatching and traits that influence the seasonal timing of diapause. The covariance may result from either phenotypic plasticity or from genetic covariance between diapause timing and hatching probability.

AB The statistical distributions of the counts of organisms are generally skewed, and hence not normally distributed, nor are variances constant across treatments. We present a likelihood-ratio testing framework based on the negative binomial distribution that tests for the goodness of fit of this distribution to the observed counts, and then tests for differences in the mean and/or aggregation of the counts among treatments. Inferences about differences in means among treatments as well as the dispersion of the counts are possible. Simulations demonstrated that the statistical power of ANOVA is about the same as the likelihood-ratio testing procedure for testing equality of means, but our proposed testing procedure also provides information on dispersion. Type I error rates of Poisson regression exceeded the expected 5%, even when corrected for overdispersion. Count data on Orange-crowned Warblers (Vermivora celata) are used to demonstrate the procedure.

AB Parasites that are transmitted from prey to predator are often associated with altered prey behavior. Although many concur that behavior modification is a parasite strategy that facilitates transmission by making parasitized prey easier for predators to capture, there is little evidence from field experiments. We observed that conspicuous behaviors exhibited by killifish (Fundulus parvipinnis) were associated with parasitism by larval trematodes. A field experiment indicated that parasitized fish were substantially more susceptible to predation by final host birds. These results support the behavior-modification hypothesis and emphasize the importance of parasites for predator-prey interactions.

AB In laboratory experiments, I studied the influences of bacterial density and light on the ingestion and growth rates, pigment contents, and the carbon and phosphorus turnover rates of the mixotrophic flagellate Ochromonas sp. The investigated strain is a bacterivorous flagellate that can enhance its photosynthetic apparatus and grow phototrophically when bacterial densities are low. This was also evident from significantly higher chlorophyll a contents during active photosynthetic growth phases. Moderate phototrophic growth should be possible even if bacteria were absent. Bacterial ingestion rates increased hyperbolically with bacterial density, and there was no difference between light- and dark-adapted cells. Ochromonas released soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) when growth was predominantly phagotrophic, but it took up SRP when growth was phototrophic. The mixotrophic strategy in Ochromonas appears to be bound up with costs and trade-offs: Ochromonas needs high bacterial densities to reach maximum growth rates, its basic metabolic costs are higher than for obligately phagotrophic flagellates, and its phototrophic growth rates are lower than for obligately phototrophic phytoplankton of comparable size.

AB Species evolve in response to the abiotic and biotic interactions they experience in a community, and so studying the adaptation of species in a community context is a necessary component for understanding the development of community structure. Previous studies have suggested that Enallagma damselflies (Odonata: Coenagrionidae) invaded aquatic habitats with large dragonflies as the top predators at least twice, and large changes in morphological structures (e.g., caudal lamellae acid abdomen), which should increase swimming speed, are associated with these invasions. This is significant because these species swim away from attacking predators, whereas species in the ancestral habitat (habitats with fish as the top predators) do not swim from attacking predators. We quantified swimming speed over a large ontogenetic size range for larvae of seven Enallagma species, two in dragonfly lakes and five in fish lakes. Results of analysis of covariance and a modification of Felsenstein's method of evolutionary contrasts indicate that a large evolutionary increase in the slope of the ontogenetic relationship between swimming speed and log(e)(body length) is associated with invasions into dragonfly lakes, and this shift results in larvae of dragonfly-lake species being faster swimmers, especially in larger size classes, than larvae of fish-lake species. We also present experimental results demonstrating that damselflies with larger lamellae are faster swimmers and have higher survival when exposed to dragonfly predation. The results of this study indicate that the change in selective environment associated with habitat shifts into dragonfly lakes promoted adaptations for increased swimming speed in Enallagma lineages. The potential ramifications of this adaptation for community structure are discussed.

AB Tropical hummingbirds often forage in mixtures of several plant species. As a result, pollen is often transferred among heterospecific flowers. The ''Sexual Architecture Hypothesis,'' a paradigm of pollination ecology and angiosperm evolution, suggests that the severity of such interspecific pollen transfer should reflect the similarity in the architecture of sexual structures (specifically, placement of stigma and anthers) among the flowers involved. We evaluated the hypothesis with six species of Costa Rican cloud-forest plants varying greatly in sexual architecture but all pollinated by the same hummingbird, Lampornis calolaema. Captive Lampornis visited five long-styled, ''pollen-donor'' flowers of distylous, self-incompatible Palicourea lasiorrachis (Rubiaceae), then 20 short-styled recipient flowers of Palicourea, with or without five flowers of a second species intervening. We assessed intraspecific pollen transfer from Palicourea donors by counting pollen tubes in styles of the recipients. We examined interspecific pollen transfer between Palicourea and each of the five other species by counting heterospecific grains deposited on stigmas of Palicourea recipients, and Palicourea grains deposited on stigmas and anthers of the heterospecific flowers. In a separate experiment, we examined how mixed-species flower visits modified the pollen loads actually carried by birds. Results did not uphold the Sexual Architecture Hypothesis. A single visit to any heterospecific flower greatly affected the hummingbird's prior load of Palicourea pollen, regardless of where the second species placed its own pollen on the bird. Interspecific pollen transfer occurred consistently, but (1) heterospecific grains usurped little space on stigmas of Palicourea recipients and had no discernible effect on pollen-tube growth, whereas (2) few Palicourea grains landed specifically on anthers and stigmas of heterospecific flowers. Instead, numerous Palicourea grains apparently were scraped off on other floral structures such as the corolla. Consequently, every species of intervening flowers, regardless of its sexual architecture per se, strongly reduced pollen transfer from donor to recipient Palicourea flowers, on average by 76%. In fact, the most drastic reductions resulted from the two species whose sexual architectures least resembled that of Palicourea.
   Results imply that ''pollen scraping'' by floral structures other than anthers and stigmas may be important and widespread among some animal-pollinated flowers. Thus, except in cases where no other floral structures contact pollinators, the positions of anthers and stigmas alone may have little bearing on the severity of interspecific pollen transfer and competitive interactions among plants sharing pollinators.

AB Why do birds partition habitats? Possible explanations include nonoverlapping food distributions, interspecific competition, and predation. If food limits distributions, species should forage most successfully in their preferred habitats and should experience poorer food intake rates elsewhere. These same predictions hold if species distributions are shaped by exploitative competition. We tested the foraging success hypothesis and exploitative competition hypothesis as explanations of the habitat distributions of Sage Sparrows (Amphispiza belli), Black-throated Sparrows (A. bilineata), and Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis), which spend the winter in different habitats along an elevational gradient in the Sonoran Desert of southern California. Individuals of each species were transplanted between habitats in a portable aviary and observed while foraging on naturally occurring seeds. Predictions of the foraging success hypothesis and exploitative competition hypothesis were not confirmed. Only Dark-eyed Juncos achieved their highest foraging success in their preferred habitat. Black-throated Sparrows experienced nearly identical foraging success in all three habitats, yet are confined to only one of them naturally. Sage Sparrows foraged more successfully in habitats other than that in which they naturally occur. We conclude that immediate foraging gains do not explain habitat distributions of these birds, and that interference competition, predation, or other unknown factors are responsible. We contrast this finding with that seen in Galapagos finches in which bird distributions closely matched food supply.

AB Several recent papers developed and applied a novel approach for the analysis of animal movement paths, based on calculating the paths' fractal dimensions. The estimated fractal dimension is used to describe the pattern of the: interaction between animal movement and landscape heterogeneity, and possibly to extrapolate movement patterns of organisms across spatial scales. Here, I critically examine the key assumption of the fractal approach: that the estimated fractal dimension is constant over some biologically relevant range of spatial scales. Use of a correlated random walk as a null hypothesis for movement suggests thar the fractal dimension should grade smoothly from near 1 at very small spatial scares to near 2 at very Large spatial scales. Several empirical data sets exhibit a qualitative pattern in agreement with this prediction. I conclude that ecologists should avoid calculating and using the fractal dimension of movement paths, unless self-similarity (a constant fractal dimension) for some range of spatial scales is demonstrated. An alternative approach employing random-walk models provides a more powerful framework for translating individual movements in heterogeneous space into spatial dynamics of populations.

AB The lacertid lizard Podarcis hispanica atrata maintained remarkably constant body temperatures (T-b) throughout its daily activity period in early autumn, despite significant variability in available operative temperatures (T-e). Lizard T(b)s were substantially closer to the species' selected temperature range (the target T(b)s for thermoregulation, estimated by the central 80% of the temperatures selected in a laboratory photothermal gradient) than were a random sample of T(e)s, indicating that this population thermoregulates both accurately and effectively. We compared observed behaviors and T(b)s to the predictions of two hypotheses. The ''no thermoregulation'' null hypothesis predicted that lizard activity and microsite use would be unaffected by thermal constraints. The ''only thermoregulation'' hypothesis predicted that lizards would be active only at those times and in those places where T(e)s fell within the selected temperature range. To evaluate the contributions of various behavioral adjustments (activity times, use of microhabitats and sun-shade patches, basking, and shuttling) to temperature regulation, we combined results from direct behavioral observations with information on the T(e)s available at different times of day and in different microsites (combinations of structural microhabitats and sun-shade patches). Lizard activity patterns did not match the predictions of either hypothesis, but the observed pattern of activity produced T(e)s that were, on average, 1.0 degrees C closer to the selected temperature range than were T(b)s predicted by the ''no thermoregulation'' hypothesis. The lizards' use of microsites (combinations of structural microhabitats and sun-shade patches) was more similar to predictions of the ''no thermoregulation'' hypothesis than to those of the ''only thermoregulation'' hypothesis. Nevertheless, the lizards' use of specific microsites produced T(b)s that were, on average, 1.9 degrees C closer to the selected temperature range than were randomly available T(e)s. The relative contributions of different behavioral mechanisms varied with time of day. In the early morning, low movement rates, selection of sunny microsites, and most notably, adoption of a basking posture contributed to temperature regulation, In the late morning and early afternoon, no thermoregulatory behaviors were necessary, as indicated by randomly positioned models that achieved mean T(e)s within the selected temperature range. At midday, frequent movements between sunny and shaded microsites probably reduced heat loads on lizards, preventing T(b)s from exceeding the selected temperature range. In the late afternoon, nonrandom use of microsites and basking behavior appeared to contribute equally to the elevation of T(b)s above randomly sampled T(e)s.

AB In clonal plants and animals, stolons and runners often promote rapid directional growth and escape from crowded microhabitats. Here we evaluate the effects of density on clonal growth and dispersal by stolons, on colony mortality, and on recruitment in the soft coral Efflatounaria sp. This colonial organism forms dense aggregations on mid-shelf and outer reefs of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, where it is subjected to frequent physical and biological disturbances. Stolonal growth and asexual recruitment of new colonies (by budding) were enhanced by experimentally reducing local density. Within unmanipulated aggregations of Efflatounaria, per-capita rates of asexual recruitment were higher at low density, but colony survivorship was lower. Furthermore, the effect of density on stolonal growth and dispersal of daughter colonies varied as a function of a colony's history of disturbance. Disturbance was simulated by detaching from the substrate a newly budded colony that was still connected by a stolen to the parent colony. At low density, these pairs of partially detached colonies moved apart, while at high density, stolonally connected colonies moved closer together.
   Our results suggest that Efflatounaria employs a plastic life-history strategy that promotes recovery from injuries and the formation of dense aggregations. At low density, stolons facilitate rapid directional growth, asexual recruitment, and aggregation. At high density, clonal growth is inhibited, and mortality rates are greatly reduced. Enhanced survival within aggregations provides the adaptive context for interpreting the influence of density and disturbance history on the population dynamics of this clonal organism.

AB Parasites and disease have been increasingly recognized as agents of ecological and evolutionary importance. Because the endocrine and immune systems are related, it is also likely that hormonally controlled traits, such as secondary sexual characters, may be influenced by responses to disease. Testosterone appears to be associated with a suppressed immune system in many vertebrates, and evidence from captive Red Jungle Fowl suggests that the sexes differ in blood parameters involved in immunity and that comb length is negatively correlated with lymphocyte number in males. Immune system parameters may provide a useful gauge of condition in captive and field-caught animals.

AB A native asexual gecko, Lepidodactylus lugubris, declines numerically when the sexual gecko Hemidactylus frenatus invades urban/suburban habitats throughout the Pacific. Previous studies showed that the competitive displacement occurs rapidly and is facilitated by clumped insect resources. Five lines of evidence suggest that the mechanism of displacement is primarily due to differences in the ability of each species to exploit insect resources. (1) These species show nearly complete diet overlap. (2) Insects are a limiting resource for both geckos as evidenced by positive demographic effects with increased insect abundance. (3) Hemidactylus frenatus depletes insect resources to lower levels than L. lugubris, which results in reduced rates of resource acquisition in L. lugubris. (4) This reduced resource acquisition translates into significant reductions in the body condition, fecundity, and survivorship of L. lugubris individuals. (5) Evidence for interference (and other) mechanisms does not account for these negative demographic effects on L. lugubris.
   Interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition for L. lugubris, with increasing L. lugubris density having negligible effect on H. frenatus, mirroring the asymmetry of the large-scale displacement. The superior harvesting ability of H. frenatus is most pronounced when insects are clumped spatially and temporally, and is attributable to a variety of species-specific traits such as their larger body size, faster running speed, and reduced intraspecific interference while foraging. We conclude that clumped resources can increase interspecific exploitation competition, and this mechanism may contribute to species turnover when human environmental alterations redistribute resources.

AB Habitat specialization is an effective mechanism of coexistence among competing species. But many communities also include generalized species whose habitat use overlaps that of the specialists. Two hypotheses seem most likely to account for the pattern. iii Habitat generalists may coexist in competitively structured communities by exploiting habitats unused, or underused, by habitat specialists. (2) Population densities of the specialized species may be limited (e.g., by predation) below levels where the specialists can competitively exclude habitat generalists. I evaluated these ideas in a community of small mammals occupying mesic and xeric habitats at nine different locations in the Rocky Mountains of southern Alberta, Canada. A chipmunk generalist coexists with two specialists, one with a distinct preference for xeric habitat (deer mouse), and another with a similar preference for mesic habitat (red-backed vole). Habitat selection appeared to depend primarily on the density of conspecifics. The generalist coexisted by responding to habitat al a larger scale than did the specialists. Shared predators, whose habitat selection operates on a larger scale than that of their prey, may augment coexistence of all species by reinforcing habitat selection by the specialists.

AB Research on predator impact in streams has generally ignored density-dependent effects. Although predator and prey behaviors are known to influence the impact of stream predators on local prey populations, no study has simultaneously addressed how predator impacts, and behavioral mechanisms contributing to those impacts, vary with prey density. I assessed the effect of a stream invertebrate predator (stonefly) on local prey (baetid mayfly) density across a gradient of six prey densities in in situ channels with natural substrata. Calculations of predator foraging rates and prey responses were based, in part, on an empirically based model assuming an exponential decline in prey densities. Total predator impact (measured as the negative natural log of the ratio of prey remaining in predator vs. predator-free channels) across prey densities followed a unimodal curve, with reduced predator effects at high and low, relative to intermediate, prey densities. Although direct predator consumption was more important than predator-induced emigration in explaining overall prey losses across all prey densities (65 vs. 35%), the relative importance of each loss process varied across individual prey densities. Total baetid drift increased with, and per capita drift was independent of, baetid benthic density in all predator treatments. Total and per capita drift rates of baetids were increased at least 3.5 times in the presence of predatory stoneflies. Few baetids were observed on the tops of rocks in either control or predator treatments during the day; however, baetid numbers on upper rock surfaces increased substantially at night and were significantly reduced by stonefly presence. The proportion of baetid populations on surface substrata was low and unaffected by predator presence during the day (0.3%) but was reduced in predator relative to predator free channels at night (4 vs. 14%). Predatory stoneflies exhibited a type III functional response, and stonefly emigration decreased as initial baetid density increased. These results suggest that discrepancies in predator impacts between previous studies may be owing to prey density and reflect prey and predator behaviors that vary with prey density.

AB Factors responsible for patterns of canopy tree replacement were studied for 22 yr in Warren Woods, Michigan, USA, an old-growth forest codominated by American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum). Our goal was to distinguish among four hypotheses: autogenic succession, allogenic succession, autogenic coexistence, and allogenic coexistence.
   We could discern neither successional change toward increasing dominance by sugar maple or beech nor beech self-replacement by root sprouts. In the forest as a whole, from 1933 to 1980, sugar maple remained dominant in small understory size classes, and beech remained dominant in larger understory size classes and in the canopy.
   We could identify no plausible species-specific canopy influences or consistent responses of understory individuals that could be the basis for autogenic succession or autogenic coexistence. No significant differences existed below canopy beech or below canopy maple in: (1) beech root influence as measured by Epifagus root parasites; (2) light intensity as measured by extension growth of 0.2-0.8 m tall sugar maple; (3) leaf litter as measured by densities of beech and sugar maple leaves just after autumn leaf fall; or (4) inhibition as measured by death of sapling beech and sugar maple. Comparisons under single canopy trees and under monospecific patches showed that understory beech were larger than maple, and this pattern was accentuated below monospecific canopy patches both of maple and beech. This suggested autogenic succession, but coring data were not consistent with this hypothesis, because the largest subcanopy stems of beech and maple were established less often after conspecific or after heterospecific canopy individuals existed above them than before or at the same time.
   We could not falsify an allogenic coexistence hypothesis that beech or maple advantage changes as light levels fluctuate with frequencies and sizes of treefall gaps. Maples that had recently reached canopy height had been suppressed for an average of only 20 yr, but most had undergone multiple cycles of suppression and release associated with multiple treefall gap events. In contrast beech that had recently reached canopy height had been suppressed an average of 121. yr despite having a similar number of suppression-release cycles as maple. Differences between paired individuals, matched for light microenvironments and height, confirmed our hypothesis that the strong apical dominance of maple led to an advantage in fast upward growth in vertical light gradients of gaps and the long lateral branches of beech led to an advantage in an understory with light flecks and in horizontal light gradients from nearby gaps. Beech's better performance in the understory acid maple's better performance in gaps led us to predict that beech would decrease in dominance in the canopy if treefall rate increased. From 1949-1974 treefall gaps averaged 0.16 trees per hectare per year and consisted of mostly single treefalls; we projected that in these gaps beech to maple ratios in the canopy would become 1 to 1. From 1975 to 1994 treefall gaps averaged 1.64 trees per hectare per year and consisted of mostly multiple treefalls; we projected that in these gaps the ratio of beech to maple winners will become 1 to 2.5.
   We conclude that species-specific differences in response to light level, with allogenic spatial and temporal fluctuation in frequency and area of treefall gaps, are sufficient to explain patterns of beech and sugar maple replacement in the canopy in the old-growth forest at Warren Woods.

AB Ramet dynamics and net aerial primary productivity (NAPP) were studied in samples of Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) at Sapelo Island, Georgia. Three populations were compared: tall, short, and short with nitrogen fertilization in spring (short/N). Tall and short S. alterniflora populations had different demographic characteristics. The short population had a shorter leaf longevity (49 vs. 72 d) and a higher leaf turnover than the tall population, which may be due to high salinity and nitrogen limitation in the high marsh. Although the average ramet longevities of tall and short populations were similar (231 and 204 d, respectively), cohorts of the tall population that emerged early in the growing season had a significantly longer average life-span than those of the short population, probably because they had more support from belowground reserves that led to a higher initial survival rate. Leaf number, leaf area, shoot density, and biomass production of the short population were greatly increased by spring nitrogen fertilization, but the longevity of leaves and ramets was little affected. Using the demographic data and phytometric equations (nondestructive method), new growth was found throughout the year in S. alterniflora populations at Sapelo Island. The average dry mass NAPP was estimated to be 1105, 2244, and 1520 g . m(-2). yr(-1) for the short, short/N, and tall populations, respectively. Because of its higher leaf turnover, the short population had a higher leaf to stem production ratio than the tall population. NAPP estimates obtained by nondestructive methods usually lie between overestimates and underestimates from harvest methods, indicating that non-destructive methods give accurate estimates of NAPP for salt marshes. Using the highest spring aerial production rates, the upper limits of annual dry mass total production of S. alterniflora at Sapelo Island were calculated as 2555 g/m(2) for the short population and 4526 g/m(2) for the tall population. These limits are lower than many previous estimates of annual total primary production for S. alterniflora.

AB I examine the suggestion of Holling (1992) that distributions of body sizes for animals show clumps corresponding to basic biotic and abiotic processes operating at different scales in time and space. This is done by comparing the properties of observed sample distributions with what is obtained from computer-generated samples taken from distributions with different numbers of modes. A combination of kernel density estimation and smoothed bootstrap resampling provides a test for whether a distribution with k + 1 modes fits significantly better than a distribution with k modes. The analysis of three data sets discussed by Holling shows sample size distributions that are consistent with the hypothesis that the underlying distributions are unimodal or bimodal. A fourth data set has a sample distribution that seems unusual even for observations from a distribution with eight modes.

AB Some plant pathogens attract pollinating insects and thus have the potential to influence the pollination of flowers, just as different flower species can influence one another's pollination. Showy, flower-like pseudoflowers caused by the rust fungus Puccinia monoica on Arabis holboellii (Brassicaceae) commonly co-occur with flowers of Anemone patens (Ranunculaceae). I evaluated the effects of pseudoflowers and anemone on each other's visitation, and the effect of pseudoflowers on the seed set of anemone. I expected that at low overall ''flower'' densities visitation would be facilitated in patches containing a mixture of these species. At low densities, pseudoflowers or flowers alone may be too rare to attract sufficient visitors, but the addition of the other species could make mixtures more attractive and thus increase visitation rates. At high densities I expected that ''flowers'' in mixtures would compete for pollinators because it is more energy efficient for pollinators to concentrate visits on the most rewarding species. I used artificial arrays to separate the effects of ''flower'' density and relative frequency on visitation. Local density was not a good predictor of the influence of one species on the other. Instead, visitation patterns depended most strongly on the kind of visitor (flies vs. bees). Visitation to A. patens by flies was facilitated by the presence of pseudoflowers at both high and low densities, whereas visitation to pseudoflowers was not significantly influenced by A. patens at either density. Local density affected visitation by bees, but relative frequency did not. In addition to observing visitation, I also quantified the effects of interspecific movement of both pollen and spores on the reproductive success of A. patens. Although the presence of pseudoflowers sometimes facilitates visitation to A. patens, this effect could be counterbalanced by competition through interspecific insect movement: sticky pseudoflowers remove pollen from visiting insects, and fungal spermatia deposited on flower stigmas reduce seed set.

AB Ecologists have long been interested in the differences that exist among communities. If species adapted rapidly and without constraint, and if any lineage could occur in any community, then we would expect differences in community structure to be indicative of environmental differences. Because lineages differ in their evolutionary potential and are geographically restricted, however, comparisons of community structure must take account of communities' histories. Phylogenetic information about the constituent lineages in a community can allow lineage effects to be factored out, thus allowing an assessment of environmental determinants of community structure. In addition, phylogenetic information permits understanding of how communities have evolved through time and suggests hypotheses that may be tested using extant communities. Methodological difficulties with the application of these methods to community ecological issues are also discussed.

AB Among iguanian lizards, males are often larger than females. As a result, much attention has been directed toward understanding the evolution of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in this group. SSD can result from a number of developmental, physiological, and demographic processes, which may cause sex differences in growth trajectories, timing of maturity, and adult age distributions. Knowledge of these proximate mechanisms can improve our understanding of the evolution of SSD. Only recently, however, have efforts been directed toward understanding proximate mechanisms. I examined the proximate causes of SSD in a population of a South American iguanian lizard, Microlophus occipitalis. The majority of the SSD in this population resulted from continued postmaturity growth in males and reduced postmaturity growth in females. Additionally, adult males tended to live longer than females, which affected adult age and size distributions. The proportion of young individuals in samples had strong effects on temporal fluctuations in SSD in the population. I discuss the importance of studying proximate mechanisms for evolutionary analyses of SSD in organisms that continue to grow after reaching maturity.

AB Using black spruce (Picea mariana) macrofossil remains at the forest-tundra to tundra transition in northern Quebec, Canada, we address the question: did the boreal forest limit shift in unison with climate change during the Holocene? Logs buried in peatlands, charcoal in the organic soil layers on well-drained sites, and dry pear underlying stunted clonal spruce were sampled across a 60-km transect south and north of the modern forest limit. Of 146 spruce logs sampled south of the modern forest limit, 34 were C-14 dated between 4580 and 1540 yr BP, and 34 additional logs were cross-dated with C-14- dated spruces (3010-1540 yr BP) using diagnostic tree rings. South of the forest limit, charcoal with abundant spruce fragments was widespread in dry-mesic sites and dated between 1920 and 1140 yr BP. No spruce logs or charcoal were found in all the surveyed sites north of the forest limit. The residence time of humified peat confined to the area occupied by tundra clonal spruces ranged between 3040 and 630 yr BP. The absence of spruce macrofossils in the tundra zone, together with the geographic coincidence of the charcoal limit and forest limit, strongly suggests that the forest limit remained stable during the last 2000-3000 yr BP. Old-aged peat produced by tundra spruces is additional evidence for the stability of the forest limit. Because only spruce is able to accumulate such a thick organic layer, the C-14 dates of basal peat indicate that spruce clones developed continuously in the absence of external disturbance at least over the last 3000 yr BP. The stability of the forest limit during warm (approximate to 2000 yr BP, medieval times, and this century) and cold (approximate to 3000 and 1300 yr BP, and the Little Ice Age) periods of the late Holocene demonstrates that mechanisms allowing forest limit advance or retreat are not easily triggered by climatic change.

AB Rhus radicans, a root-climbing liana, is not distributed randomly among potential host tree species in an old-growth mixed mesophytic forest on the southern Cumberland Plateau of north Alabama, USA. Vines are more abundant than expected on Carya ovata and Quercus rubra, but less abundant than expected on Juglans nigra, Acer saccharum, and Sassafras albidum. Seed germination and early seedling growth in the presence of bark extracts suggest allelochemical interactions may influence the observed host preferences.

AB We examined plant tolerance of gall-insect attack and gall-insect performance in rosinweed (Silphium integrifolium, Asteraceae) and its apical meristem galler Antistrophus silphii (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae). Gall densities were varied in field rosinweed populations, while gall densities, water, and nutrients were varied for rosinweed in an experimental garden. Field plants grew under prevailing resource and competitive conditions, but garden plants grew free from competition, so gall-insect impacts, rosinweed regrowth, and gall-insect performance were observed under widely different growing conditions. Seasonal measures of rosinweed growth and leaf physiology, and end-of-season measures of biomass, reproduction, gall-wasp emergence, growth, sex ratios, and parasitism were made for both experiments.
   Rosinweed poorly tolerated Antistrophus gall damage in the field. Galls reduced plant height, leaf area, and inflorescence production. Rosinweed diverted biomass to stems, but produced no regrowth from axillary meristems. In the garden, rosinweed was much more tolerant of Antistrophus gall damage. Galls initially reduced plant height and leaf area, but axillary meristems grew profusely after gall formation, producing nearly all galled plant inflorescences and more than replacing leaf area initially lost to gall formation. Water- and nutrient-supplemented rosinweed were most tolerant of gall damage, experiencing little loss of total biomass or reproductive output. Field rosinweed failed to mount a tolerance-enhancing regrowth response because galls, resource availability, and competition combined to constrain axillary meristem growth. Gall-wasp performance was largely independent of rosinweed tolerance. Emergence, growth, sex ratios, and parasitism were comparable in field and garden, and only slightly affected by resource availability. Gall-insect performance may be buffered from environmental variation, disconnecting plant and herbivore population dynamics. Rosinweed's poor tolerance of gall damage may typify forb responses to herbivory in highly competitive grassland plant communities.

AB A statistical hypothesis test for a difference between the spatial distributions of two populations is presented. The test is based upon a generalization of the two-sample Cramer-von Mises test for a difference between two univariate probability distributions. It is designed to be sensitive to differences in the way the populations are distributed across the study area but insensitive to a difference in abundance between the two populations. The procedure is nonparametric and uses the methodology of a randomization test to determine the level of significance of the test statistic.

   INGESTION
AB Recent experimental evidence indicates the importance in some pelagic systems of mixotrophic protists that combine photosynthetic ability with the ability to ingest bacteria. If both bacteria and phytoplankton are mineral nutrient limited, this should provide the mixotrophs with the double benefit of combining removal of their competitor with ingestion of the limiting nutrient in pelleted form. It is the objective of this study to expand the classical theories of competition and predation to explore the effect on the microbial food web of one trophic group possessing both strategies. In a chemostat scenario, we analyzed the two-species situation of a mixotroph preying on mineral-nutrient-limited bacteria, and also the situations when the mixotroph in addition has to compete with specialized photoautotrophic and phagotrophic protists, each superior to the mixotroph in their specialized nutritional modes. In the mixotroph-bacteria relationship, somewhat paradoxically, high predatory abilities will reduce the quantitative importance of predation in the mixotroph's nutrition. The reason is a strong reduction in prey abundance, allowing the mixotroph to survive as a photoautotroph despite its low competitive ability. In the three-species case with mixotrophs, bacteria, and specialized phagotrophs, it is shown that the mixotroph can compensate for a ''price'' paid in reduced affinity for bacterial prey by a sufficiently high affinity for mineral nutrients. In the other three-species case where the mixotroph has to compete with a specialized photoautotroph, the situation is more complex; there is an optimum value fur the mixotroph's predatory ability at which mixotroph biomass is maximized. In the general situation with all four species (bacteria, mixotrophs, and specialized auto- and phagotrophs) potentially present, different mixotrophic strategies will alter the equilibrium composition of the consortium, with the mixotroph being most successful with a high affinity for nutrients and an intermediate affinity for bacteria, In the simple form used here, the model predicts no equilibrium with all four species simultaneously present. The theory is in principle directly applicable to laboratory experimentation.

AB Theory predicts that individuals within social groups should be more similar (less variable) phenotypically than individuals between groups. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the variability of certain phenotypic characters (body size, parasite load) of individual fish within and between sampled shoals with the phenotypic variability of randomly constituted shoals of the same size. We caught 34 entire fish shoals in a lake, and for each shoal member, we identified the species, measured its body length, and counted the number of black spots (indicating the presence of a parasitic trematode worm) visible through their skin. We also recorded two habitat characteristics, water depth and distance to cover, at the location where each of the 34 shoals was caught to ascertain whether (and to which degree) the spatial distributions of different fish species and fish size classes were determined by certain habitat characteristics. A comparison between the observed and the randomly assorted shoals (obtained through computer simulations) revealed that fish at our study site exhibited a significant association with conspecifics and with individuals of similar body size (within and across species); that is, shoals were assorted by species and by individual body size. Parasite-assortative shoaling was not observed. Different species (and to a lesser degree different size classes within species) showed a tendency to occur in different microhabitats. Nevertheless, despite some degree of habitat segregation, there remained considerable spatial overlap between the different species and fish body size classes. Furthermore, given the spatial proximity of different habitats and the relatively weak habitat association of most species, we therefore suggest that active shoal choice by individual fish was the most important determinant of shoal composition.

AB The ontogeny of many size-structured organisms is marked by a series of niche shifts that divides a population into ecologically distinct stages. Consequently, overall population dynamics are affected both by processes operating within individual stages and by factors that influence transitions between stages. In largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), there is a diet shift from littoral invertebrates to fish that typically occurs sometime in their 1st yr. I examined factors that influenced this shift by tracking diet and growth trajectories of young-of-year (YOY) bass cohorts in several Michigan lakes over 2 yr. Cohorts differed in consumption rates of invertebrate prey, which led to an early divergence in bass growth among lakes. This variation in early growth had dramatic consequences for the timing of the shift to piscivory. In lakes with rapid growth in the invertebrate feeding stage, bass were able to gain a size advantage over YOY bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), their primary fish prey, which facilitated a shift to piscivory as soon as these bluegill became available as food. In contrast, slow growth during the invertebrate feeding stage reduced the size advantage of bass over bluegill and delayed or even prevented the shift to piscivory in the ist yr. Niche shifts in bass were also sensitive to environmental conditions ear ly in the growing season. In 1992, low temperatures caused a reduction in growth rates that prevented the establishment of a size advantage over bluegill in all but one lake. Bass grew much faster after switching to piscivory; thus the shift from invertebrates to fish strongly influenced sizes attained by YOY bass by autumn. Because survivorship of YOY bass is strongly size dependent (particularly through the first winter), the timing of the shift to piscivory may be important in determining survival and recruitment rates. Therefore, processes that operate on bass in the invertebrate feeding stage can influence the shift to piscivory, and this can potentially have important effects on the dynamics of the population as a whole.

   LOAD; SELECTION
AB Patterns of host selection and host use by insects with parasitic lifestyles are predicted to be fundamentally dynamic, responding to environmental conditions and physiological states. A particularly robust prediction is that the number of mature eggs that a female carries (her ''egg load'') should influence behavior. As egg load decreases, females are predicted to exhibit increasingly selective host use patterns. We tested the hypothesis that egg load and host size influence the behavior of the parasitoid wasp Aphytis aonidiae attacking the armored scale insect Quadraspidiotus perniciosus. Aphytis females can use hosts either for oviposition or for adult ''host feeding,'' which is the consumption of host material by adult parasitoids. Theory predicts that host feeding should be (i) favored by low egg loads and (ii) more prevalent on lower-quality (smaller) hosts. We conducted observations of individual females foraging freely in the field to determine whether hosts were used for oviposition or for host feeding. As predicted by theory, the likelihood that a host was used for oviposition (as opposed to host feeding) increased with both parasitoid egg load and host size. Thus, parasitoids exhibited higher host-selectivity at lower egg loads. Since egg load and a parasitoid's experience with hosts were not experimentally separated, the egg load effect could in principle have been either direct or indirect and operating through a correlation with experience. In either case, this result constitutes the first demonstration of a link between physiological state and oviposition behavior by a parasitoid in the field. Parasitoid agr, as measured using a wing wear index, did not influence behavior. A laboratory study revealed that the relationship between a host's size: and the size and initial egg load of the parasitoid developing on that host was positive, but that it followed a pattern of diminishing returns. No effect of host size on behavior could be detected over the range of host sizes that were within the asymptotic region of this relationship.

AB Analyses of nitrogen and phosphorus in the senesced leaves of 89 species of deciduous and evergreen woody perennials were used (1) to discover the limits of ultimate potential resorption (maximal withdrawal of nutrients from senescing leaves), (2) to determine a means by which resorption can be categorized as complete or incomplete, (3) to develop the concept of resorption proficiency (measured as the levels to which nutrients have been reduced in senesced leaves), (4) to compare resorption in evergreen vs. deciduous species, (5) to assess the impact of phylogeny on resorption, (6) to compare resorption in actinorhizal vs. non-nitrogen-fixing species, and (7) to consider the efficacy of using multiple measures of resorption to answer questions regarding the function and evolution of this process, rather than relying solely on analyses of resorption efficiency (percentage reduction of nutrients between green and senesced leaves).
   Concentrations of 0.3% nitrogen and 0.01% phosphorus in senesced leaves represent ultimate potential resorption of these nutrients in woody perennials. Resorption proficiency and potential resorption were quantitatively defined in two models that describe both resorption that is maximal and biochemically complete, and that which is not. Resorption is highly proficient in plants that have reduced nitrogen and phosphorus in their senescing leaves to concentrations below 0.7% and 0.05%, respectively. An important feature of knowing the levels to which nutrients can be reduced in senescing leaves is that these values offer an objective gauge by which to measure the success of resorption as a nutrient conservation mechanism.
   Evergreens were significantly more proficient at resorbing phosphorus than were deciduous species (0.045% vs. 0.067% P in senesced leaves, respectively) and plants capable of symbiotic nitrogen fixation were significantly less proficient at resorbing nitrogen than were nonfixers (1.6% vs. 0.9% N in senesced leaves, respectively). Resorption proficiency appeared to parallel some phylogenic trends, yet the influence of phylogeny was not so significant as to overwhelm the effects of recent selection. The ability of plants to reduce nitrogen in senescing leaves was significantly correlated with their ability to reduce phosphorus.
   Measurement and analysis of resorption proficiency, when coupled with concurrent consideration of potential resorption and resorption efficiency, should facilitate and expedite the ongoing attempt to resolve complex questions regarding the environmental constraints that influence resorption, and the selection pressures that have directed the evolution of this process.

AB In a guild of tide pool fishes on the outer coast of Washington State, USA, recruitment varied both temporally (seasonally and interannually) and spatially (over intervals of 4-5 km, across a maximum of 30 km of shoreline). Using census data and mark-recapture data, I studied the demography of four species of tide pool sculpins with the goal of understanding how variability in recruitment affected adult population patterns. I found that, although adult populations reflected well the most recent recruitment pulse for the two most common species, adult population growth rate was the most sensitive to changes in survivorship rates. Similarly, analyses of the effect that variance in each demographic parameter had on variability in subsequent adult population size also showed a disproportionate effect of adult survivorship on adult population sizes. In other words, high variability in a demographic estimate did not always result in high variability in population size. Negative density dependence was documented for all species, suggesting that recruitment effects are dampened by postrecruitment events. Thus, although recruitment events could be detected in the adult population for short time periods, postrecruitment events appeared to dampen the effects of seasonal recruitment pulses in these nearshore fishes.

AB Red Grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) show unstable population dynamics. The number shot for sport at Rickarton moor in northeast Scotland, for example, has cycled with 10-11-yr periodicity since 1946. Here, demographic and other causes of a population cycle were documented from 1979-1989, and an experiment tested the prediction that removing some cocks during the increase phase would prevent a subsequent cyclic decline, Throughout the study, sport shooting was stopped on the area where the main work was done. During 1979-1982, before the experimental removal of cocks began, numbers over the whole moor rose from a trough at the start of the study. On the control area, the cyclic peak in 1983 was followed by a decline until 1988, as predicted in advance from models derived from a previous study elsewhere. On the experimental area, enough territorial cocks were removed each spring from 1982 to 1986 to prevent the population from attaining peak densities for five successive years, and no cyclic decline occurred. The removal of cocks resulted in similar numbers of hens being lost from the breeding population. The main demographic cause of population change on control (cycling) and experimental (cycle broken) areas was variation in the recruitment of young cocks to the spring population. On the control area, recruitment was related to cycle phase and breeding success. Changes in food, nitrogen metabolism, and parasite burdens could not explain the cycle. Demographic patterns were consistent with a model in which changes in age structure affected recruitment. These and previous results refute four hypotheses as necessary causes of population cycles in Red Grouse: (1) maternal nutrition, (2) a version of Chitty's genetic hypothesis, (3) host-parasite (caecal threadworm), and (4) predator-prey relationships. The hypothesis that age structure changes and associated behavior cause cycles by affecting recruitment and, thus, population change, remains unrefuted..

AB Plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) are commonly thought to deter vertebrate herbivores by being toxic or by reducing nutrient assimilation. An alternative, complementary hypothesis is that PSMs may influence herbivore forage selection at subtoxic levels by imposing high detoxication costs post absorption. Many studies of insect herbivores have been undertaken to measure the metabolic load of detoxication as it relates to host-plant specialization, but results have been equivocal and the subject of much debate. Some recent studies of vertebrate herbivores indicate that metabolism of PSMs can impose a cost by increasing nutrient losses due to conjugation of PSMs to endogenous materials, and by upsetting pH homeostasis. In this study, we demonstrate that detoxication costs in Ruffed Grouse are substantial, and are reduced by selective foraging.
   In winter, Ruffed Grouse feed preferentially on quaking aspen with relatively low levels of coniferyl benzoate (CB) in staminate flower buds. We collected aspen buds with low- and high-CB levels and conducted feeding trials with captive Ruffed Grouse that had been acclimated to an aspen bud diet. We measured nutrient utilization efficiencies and excretion of detoxication conjugates. Grouse assimilated 24% less energy from high- vs. low-CB buds. Using a nutritional model, we determined that the reduction of energy utilization efficiency was mainly due to dilution of the diet by CB, and not by digestive inhibition. As CB intake increased, grouse excreted more glucuronic acid and ornithine (two major detoxication conjugates), resulting in an energetic cost of 10% to 14% of metabolizable energy intake for low- and high-CB buds, respectively. Conjugation with the amino acid ornithine increased minimum nitrogen requirement by 68% to 90% for low- and high-CB buds, respectively. Ammonium excretion also increased with CB intake, indicating an upset of pH homeostasis. Thus, detoxication costs were relatively high and increased with higher CB intake. Puffed Grouse preference for low-CB, high-protein aspen buds in nature appears to be related to lower utilization efficiency and higher detoxication costs associated with high CB concentrations. The importance of detoxication cost to herbivores must be more thoroughly evaluated and integrated into existing models of herbivore foraging behavior.

AB The patterns of luxury uptake and storage of nitrogen were studied in the rhizomatous alpine herb, Bistorta bistortoides (Pursh.). Nitrogen pools in the rhizome and shoot were measured in fertilized and nonfertilized plants over two growing seasons (3-4 growing seasons after fertilization began). Fertilized plants stored more N in the rhizome throughout both seasons than did nonfertilized plants. Inflorescence, foliar, and preformed bud N concentrations and biomass production rate did not increase in response to fertilization. The increased storage of N without a concomitant influence on biomass production demonstrates that luxury uptake occurs in this species. Increased N storage in fertilized plants was accommodated by an increase in the amino acids arginine, the nonprotein amino a acid, delta-acetylornithine, glutamine, and glutamate. Luxury uptake was accommodated entirely through filling of existing rhizome cells; no increased cell proliferation was found. Sucrose concentration was significantly lower in the recently produced rhizome tissue of fertilized plants, possibly reflecting the carbon costs of storing the additional N.
   During the first half of the season, fertilized plants relied more on stored N to drive growth, with translocation from reserves accounting for 56% and 100% of the aboveground N requirement in nonfertilized and fertilized plants, respectively. In fertilized plants, the complete reliance on stored N indicates a decrease in current-season uptake of N during the period normally associated with net N uptake in this species. This is interpreted as either (1) a seasonal shift in N uptake, or (2) a negative feedback between stored N and uptake that would constrain the continued accumulation of excess N and eliminate any long-term benefits of luxury N uptake in this species.

AB A numerical technique for assembly of ecological communities of Lotka-Volterra form is described. The technique is based upon a global criterion for coexistence of species known as permanence. This provides a relatively fast and accurate method to determine the sequence of communities that develops when species are drawn sequentially and in an arbitrary order from a regional pool of species. Steps in the assembly sequence that cannot be resolved by this method are determined by numerical integration. The results are as follows. (1) At each step in an assembly sequence, a species that succeeds in invading when rare persists in the resulting community even if one or more of the resident species becomes extinct. (2) Assembly sequences are terminated with a community that is uninvadable by any of the remaining species from the pool. The number of these endpoints is small, even when the species pool is large. (3) In some cases, the final community cannot be reassembled from the species left in it; other species, which are absent at the end, are needed for the endpoint to be reached. (4) Invasion resistance builds up in three stages during an assembly sequence. Over much of the sequence, invasion resistance shows little if any increase; during this period, species composition continues to change until the sequence happens to land on an endpoint. (5) Communities assembled from large species pools are more resistant to invasion than those assembled from small species pools.

AB According to classical exploitation theory, an increase of primary productivity should result in increased herbivore grazing pressure, thus maintaining a low plant standing crop, However, field data obtained from a salt marsh revealed a maximal grazing pressure by hares, rabbits, and geese at intermediate levels of plant standing crop. Grazing pressure was relatively low in the more productive parts. We argue that this pattern is due to a low foraging efficiency of these herbivores in dense vegetation. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we examine a plant-herbivore model where grazing becomes less efficient in dense vegetation, and analyze the behavior of this model along a gradient of primary productivity. In systems of intermediate productivity, the model predicts that a plant-herbivore system may have two stable states. In one state, the herbivore maintains a low standing crop. The other state is dominated by a dense vegetation unsuitable for herbivore grazing. In systems of high productivity, the herbivore is unable to keep plant growth in check and a dense vegetation develops. Thus, in line with our field data but in contrast to classical exploitation theory, our model does not predict ''top-down'' control in productive environments.

AB To study the numerical dynamics of plant populations, 12 experimental populations of an annual greenhouse weed, Cardamine pensylvanica, were maintained for 15 generations in controlled-environment growth chambers by growing plants in an array of pots and allowing seed for the next generation to disperse into an adjacent array of fresh pots. Discrete generations were enforced by harvesting mature plants after seed dispersal, but germination, recruitment, competition, and dispersal occurred naturally. The numerical dynamics of the experimental populations cycled from high to low density with a period of four to five generations, as indicated by negative autocorrelations in population size at lags of two and three generations. Demographic data collected during the experiment indicate that population density affected plant growth and seed set. Independent estimates of low-density recruitment were also high enough to predict complex population dynamics from simple models of direct density-dependent population regulation. However, simple population models fit to the time series data predicted stable dynamics. Similar models including time-lagged density dependence qualitatively reproduced the dynamics of the experimental populations. Delayed feedback through maternal effects or interacting herbivores or pathogens may be possible causes of the observed dynamics. This suggests that although plant population dynamics may be stabilized by direct density dependence, delayed density dependence could destabilize dynamics.

AB Recent history plays an important role in the physiology, behavior, and ecology of individuals, and in the dynamics of populations and assemblages of species. In this paper, we examine the impact of history on the species composition of intertidal reef corals, by comparing simulation models that incorporate four different levels of knowledge about the recent past (over a time scale of 1-27 yr). The models are Markov or semi-Markov transition probability matrix models, based on rates of colonization, persistence, and species replacement measured from a long-term study spanning three decades at Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef.
   Rates of colonization (transitions from free space) varied 20-fold for different species groups, while mortality (transitions to free space) ranged fivefold, reflecting a wide range of life histories among the coral assemblage. Virtually all species groups could undergo reciprocal transitions (e.g., from A to B, and B to A) in a single time interval, indicating the lack of a single competitive dominant that was capable of outcompeting all or most other species.
   Transition probabilities changed markedly as a function of history. For most species groups, the probability of persisting (i.e., ''transitions'' from A to A) increased with time. Thus, a colony that had occupied space for some time was generally more likely to continue to do so than a new arrival. This result is consistent with an escape in size for older colonies from mortality agents such as competition and predation. However, three species groups showed the opposite pattern. Algae, Pocilloporid corals, and fragile tabular Acroporn showed marked increases in transitions to free space after 3-5 yr, reflecting a more ephemeral suite of life history traits. Similarly, free space that had recently been generated had a higher rate of colonization than substratum that had been unoccupied for some time. These results falsify a major assumption of standard first-order models, i.e., that transition probabilities are constant, and that history is irrelevant.
   Although the changes in transition probabilities as a function of history were often striking, the four different models we employed show only minor variation in community composition in both transitory and climax (equilibrium) phases. Thus, while recent history was important in determining transition probabilities, it had little effect on community dynamics and structure in this system. This discrepancy is due to the rapid turnover of corals and algae on shallow reef crests, where only a small proportion of colonies survive long enough to display effects of history. All models agreed that the length of time required for this system to reach an equilibrium community structure is far longer than the observed interval between recurrent disturbances from tropical cyclones.

AB We examined soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics in a shortgrass steppe ecosystem along spatial gradients in plant inputs and temporal gradients in disturbance age because a better understanding of decay characteristics of SOM pools may improve our ability to predict ecosystem responses ra perturbation. We assessed measurable pools of SOM that are thought to correspond to active, intermediate, and passive SOM based upon turnover characteristics in three separate experiments. In a first, we evaluated SOM pools along a spatial gradient in plant inputs, from locations under individual bunch grasses to natural areas of plant removal (ant mounds). In a second experiment we assessed SOM pools across a temporal gradient in ant mounds ranging from approximate to 5 to 60 yr old. Finally, we compared our results from the second experiment to a single human-induced plant-removal experiment.
   We found that reduced root biomass accounted for up to 90% of the variation in SOM across our spatial gradients. In our examination of temporal dynamics of SOM, we found that locations with little or no plant inputs for approximate to 45 yr had 28% less total soil C than in native areas with average plant cover. We measured the greatest proportional losses (48-78%) of SOM in response to reduced plant inputs (over 30-60 yr) in the active SOM as indexed by C and N mineralization and microbial biomass C and N. The range of losses from intermediate organic matter as indexed by particulate organic matter (POM) ranged from 38 to 73%, and losses from the passive pool were proportionately lower (57%). Though this general pattern follows the course predicted by theory, and our measurements of turnover of intermediate SOM agree closely with models, results indicate a considerably slower turnover rate for the active pool and a considerably faster rate for the passive pool than expected. We compared our field estimates of plant-removal-induced SOM losses to simulation modeling results and cultivation studies. Our comparison of field results to Century model simulations indicated a possible model overestimation of the impact of plant removal on SOM loss. By comparing our plant-removal results to studies of cultivation-induced losses of SOM on the shortgrass steppe, we found that plant-removal is not as severe a disturbance as cropping, likely as a result of physical disturbances associated with tillage such as surface erosion and disturbance of soil aggregate structure.

AB Bayesian models provide a structure for studying collections of parameters such as are considered in the investigation of communities, ecosystems, and landscapes. This structure allows for improved estimation of individual parameters by considering them in the context of a group of related parameters. Individual estimates are differentially adjusted toward an overall mean, with the magnitude of their adjustment based on their precision. Consequently, Bayesian estimation allows for a more reliable ranking of parameters and, in particular, a more credible identification of extreme values from a collection of estimates.
   In Bayesian models, individual parameters are regarded as values sampled from a specified probability distribution, called a prior. The requirement that the prior be known is often regarded as an unattractive feature of Bayesian analysis and may be the reason Bayesian analyses are not frequently applied in ecological studies. Empirical Bayes methods provide an alternative approach that incorporates the structural advantages of Bayesian models while requiring a less stringent specification of prior knowledge. Empirical Bayes methods require only that the prior be in a certain family of distributions, indexed by hyperparameters that can be estimated from the available data. This structure is of interest per se, in addition to its value in allowing for improved estimation of individual parameters: for example, hypotheses regarding the existence of distinct subgroups in a collection of parameters can be considered under the empirical Bayes framework by allowing the hyperparameters to vary among subgroups.
   We describe the empirical Bayes approach in application to estimation of proportions, rising data obtained in a community-wide study of Brown-headed Cowbird parasitism rates for illustration. Empirical Bayes estimates identify those species for which there is the greatest evidence of extreme parasitism rates.
   Subgroup analysis of our data on cowbird parasitism rates indicates that parasitism rater For neotropical migrants as a group are no greater than those of resident/short-distance migrant species in this forest community. Our data and analyses demonstrate that the parasitism rates for certain neotropical migrant species (Wood Thrush and nose-breasted Grosbeak) are remarkably low while those for others (Ovenbird and Red-eyed Vireo) are remarkably high.

AB The successful integration of theories of habitat selection into landscape ecology depends upon the proper identification of habitat. Habitats must be distinguished at appropriate spatial scales, and evidence must be provided that individuals recognize and respond to the habitat classification. We use evolutionary theories to document how density-dependent habitat selection and habitat variation can be applied to identify habitats in landscapes. We apply our protocol to small-mammal (Clethrionomys gapperi) populations across a series of repeated landscapes in the Hudson Bay Lowland of Ontario, Canada. We postulated initially that the landscapes were composed of two easily distinguishable habitats, but our protocol demonstrated three habitat types influencing density-dependent habitat selection by C. gapperi. The third habitat has profound implications for population regulation in the lowland and highlights the importance of proper habitat identification.

AB A major role of facilitation between higher plant species, particularly in stressful environments, has recently been reported in several papers that suggest that beneficial interactions could be more important in the dynamics of plant communities than has been recognized to date. In a semiarid region in southeastern Spain we determined the effect of a leguminous shrub, Retama sphaerocarpa, on its environment, testing the hypothesis that facilitation by the shrub of one species of its understory, Marrubium vulgare, is reciprocal and that the shrub benefits from sheltering herbs beneath its canopy.
   Marrubium plants under Retama had greater specific leaf area, leaf mass, shoot mass, leaf area, more flowers, a higher nitrogen (N) concentration in leaf tissue, and more N per plant than isolated plants, suggesting a facilitative effect of Retama on Marrubium including increased availability of resources. Biomass of 1-yr-old cladodes, total biomass, total nitrogen content of 3-yr-old branches, and shoot water potential at midday were higher for Retama shrubs with Marrubium beneath them than in shrubs without Marrubium.
   Retama strongly improved its own environment, facilitated the growth of Marrubium and other species underneath its canopy, and at the same time obtained benefits from sheltering herbs underneath. The interaction between these two species was indirect, associated with differences in soil properties and with improved nutrient availability under shrubs compared with plants growing on their own.
   We propose that the mutual benefit of the association between Retama and Marrubium is best termed a facultative mutualism. Each partner benefits from greater availability of resources in the ''island of fertility'' that results from their association. If beneficial plant-plant interactions as described here are widespread, positive relationships may have a major role in determining the pattern and structure of plant communities.

AB Presence/absence data for the small-mammal species at sites in seven deserts were analyzed for evidence of similarity in community structure. The deserts studied were located in North and South America (268 and 118 sites, respectively), Australia (245 sites), Israel (54 sites), and greater Eurasia (Thar, 15 sites; Turkestan, 36 sites; Gobi, 98 sites). Patterns observed in all deserts included: (1) low alpha diversity (2-4 species per site); (2) high beta diversity (species turnover between sites); and (3) local coexistence of 20-30% of the species in the regional pool. Additionally, the number of species with which a species co-occurred increased with the number of sites at which that species occurred. Although these results suggested that some features of community structure were similar across deserts, other aspects, especially trophic structure, differed widely. Deserts in the northern hemisphere possessed more granivores, and the Turkestan Desert more folivores, than other deserts. Carnivorous small mammals were most strongly represented in Australia, and omnivores in South America, Australia, and the Thar. The structure of desert small-mammal communities is strongly influenced by historical factors; different taxonomic groups with distinctive trophic adaptations proliferate in different desert regions where they are subject to some common structuring processes of community assembly.

ID APPARENT COMPETITION; FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSE; COMMUNITIES; ECOSYSTEMS
AB Mathematical models are used to explore the interaction between two prey species that share a common predator. The models assume that the predator experiences density dependence via some mechanism other than prey depletion. The models also assume that the predator's functional response to each prey decreases as the density of the other prey species increases. This can occur either because of predator satiation or predator switching. The results suggest that positive indirect effects of one prey on the equilibrium density of others should occur frequently, especially when there is predator switching. Decreasing the mortality rate of one prey or adding a prey species may make it easier for additional prey species to invade the system and coexist. This occurs because the resulting decrease in the predator's functional response is greater than its positive numerical response. In many cases, different magnitudes of perturbation to one prey species will have opposite effects on the population density of the other prey species.

DE immunological ''memory''; induced defenses; jasmonic acid; methyl
   jasmonate; N-15; Nicotiana sylvestris; nicotine
ID ALKALOIDAL RESPONSES
AB Nicotine, an inducible defense in Nicotiana sylvestris, is produced in the roots and transported throughout the plant after leaf damage. Root nicotine production is activated by an endogenously produced signal, jasmonic acid (JA), which is synthesized in response to leaf damage and either directly through transport or indirectly via another signal, increases JA pools in the roots. The addition of JA or its methyl ester (MJ) to the roots of hydroponically grown plants stimulates nicotine production in the same way that leaf damage does. In this paper we use MJ to stimulate the induced defense without damaging plants in order to examine the hypothesis that these plants have an immunological ''memory'' of prior inductions. Such a ''memory'' can be measured as a change in either the speed or the amount of induced nicotine production or accumulation that results from prior inductions. ''Memory'' is an important component of the induced defenses of animals and is predicted to evolve in systems where an initial attack is a reliable predictor of future attacks.
   We induced 200 plants 1, 2, or 3 times during an 18-d period of rosette growth, allowed 6 d between inductions for the relaxation of the response between inductions and quantified changes in biomass, whole-plant nicotine pools and de novo rates of nicotine production from N-15-labeled nitrate acquired at the time of induction. Induced changes in nicotine pools and the rates of nicotine production varied across the three induction periods: the highest rates and induced pools occurred during the second induction period, but the highest concentrations were found during the first induction period. The rates of de novo nicotine production from N-15-labeled nitrate were dramatically increased by MJ stimulations during all three induction periods. We found no evidence for alterations in the rates of nicotine production in plants not currently exposed to MJ; 6 d after an induction, plants had relaxed their rates of nicotine production to levels that were not significantly different from those found in plants without a prior induction history. Moreover, the maximum pools of N-15-labeled nicotine were equivalent among all induced plants regardless of prior induction history. In summary, one or two prior inductions did not markedly affect nicotine production from recently acquired nitrate as measured in either induced or uninduced plants. However, the ecologically more relevant measure of the speed of induction is the change in whole-plant nicotine pools, and plants with one and two prior inductions increased their whole-plant nicotine pool significantly faster during the third induction period than did plants not previously induced. Plants with two prior inductions attained significant increases in their nicotine pools 2 d earlier than did plants with one or no prior inductions. Moreover, the effect was additive: plants with two prior inductions were faster than plants with one. The effects of prior inductions on the speed of the induced response did not translate into increases in the magnitude of the response at the end of the 18-d experiment. The lack of change in the magnitude of the induced response may reflect the methods used in our experiment more than the plant's capabilities. The whole-plant induced response is limited by the amount of signal transported to the roots, and since we used the same amount of MJ in all stimulations, our experiment would not detect ''memory'' in the production of the signal in the damaged leaf or its transport to the roots. These results demonstrate that plants, like animals, alter their induced defense in response to their prior experiences.

AB Most empirical studies of specialists and generalists have focused on comparisons among different species. Interspecific comparisons have recently been criticized because phenotypic trade-offs can evolve after ecological specialization. As a result, it has been suggested that intraspecific variation is the appropriate level to demonstrate functional trade-offs. We demonstrate functional trade-offs for two components of fitness in pumpkinseed sunfish (Leponzis gibbosus) from a single trophically polymorphic population: condition factor and growth rate. Condition factor was estimated using somatic lipid content, while growth rate was determined from scale measurements. Fish with extreme benthic and limnetic morphologies are on average superior to fish with intermediate morphologies, especially in the pelagic habitat. Our study is a particularly stringent test of functional trade-offs at the intraspecific level because the morphological variation is very subtle in this population.

AB This study examines how the spatial distribution of nests is related to the behavioral interactions of conspecific neighbors in a population of the seed-eating ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus. Colonies live for 15-20 yr, reaching reproductive age and a stable size at approximate to 5 yr. Spatial distributions were measured for 6 yr (1988-1993) in a population of approximate to 250 colonies of known age. The probability that a 1-yr-old colony occurs in a given location is related to the distance to, and ages of, its five nearest conspecific neighbors. One-year-old colonies are most likely to occur near small, 2- and 3-yr-old colonies.
   Neighboring colonies encounter each other when foragers of both colonies search the same area on the same day. The probability of an encounter between two colonies decreases with the distance between their nests. For colonies of all ages, encounters are most likely with their larger neighbors, greater than or equal to 5 yr old. Encounters are more likely if there was an encounter the previous day, and this effect can overwhelm the effect of distance. Two-yr-old colonies are more likely than colonies of other ages to lose ground in repeated encounters with a particular neighbor.
   Though encounters are frequent, their costs are low: few of the foragers on a trail that meets a neighbor's actually encounter an ant of the neighboring colony, and interaction with a neighboring colony does not increase the typical duration of a foraging trip. If foragers of two colonies do meet, most fights are brief, with few resulting in injury or death. These results suggest that the cost of conspecific neighbors searching the same ground for seeds may be greater than the cost of behavioral interaction itself. Exploitative competition may have more important effects than interference competition on founding colony survival and thus on the spatial distribution of nests.

AB A series of competition experiments with two genotypes of Escherichia coli showed that each genotype was favored when it was the minority, allowing their coexistence in a stable polymorphism. In these experiments, glucose was the sole source of carbon provided, and its concentration was limiting to population density. Thus, the stable polymorphism did not conform to a simple model of competitive exclusion. In similar experiments also with glucose as the sole resource, we considered two hypotheses that might explain the observed coexistence: (1) a strictly demographic trade-off, such that one genotype is competitively superior when glucose is abundant whereas the other genotype is the better competitor for sparse glucose; and (2) a cross-feeding interaction, whereby the superior competitor for glucose excretes a metabolite that acts as a second resource for which the other genotype is the better competitor. Although there was a demographic tradeoff, the advantage to the superior competitor at high glucose concentrations was too large off, the advantage to the superior competitor at high glucose concentrations was too large (given the initial concentration of glucose used in these experiments) to allow the second genotype to invade when rare at the observed rate. Therefore, the second genotype must have had some other advantage that allowed it to readily invade a population of the superior competitor for glucose. Indeed, the second genotype could increase in abundance after glucose was depleted, but only in the presence of the superior competitor for glucose thus implicating a cross-feeding interaction. These results confirmed earlier studies showing that populations of E. coli can maintain ecologically relevant genetic diversity even in a simple environment.

AB Prochilodus mariae (Characiformes: Prochilodontidae) is a detritivorous fish distributed throughout the Orinoco river basin of South America. Spectacular migrations of these fishes occur at the end of the rainy season into the Andean foothills. Prochilodus ingest large quantities of sediments and may thereby modify habitats in neotropical streams. The major objectives of this study were (1) to explore experimentally the importance of Prochilodus in structuring a tropical stream in the Venezuelan Andean piedmont, and (2) to determine whether there was sufficient ecological redundancy in a diverse and abundant assemblage of epibenthic fishes to compensate for the removal of Prochilodus. Community structure was compared among three experimental treatments: (1) Prochilodus exclusion, (2) Prochilodus enclosure, and (3) the natural fish assemblage. Selective exclusion of Prochilodus resulted in striking changes in community structure as measured by patterns of sediment accrual and the composition of algal and invertebrate assemblages. Highly significant increases in total dry mass and in ash-free dry mass of sediments accruing on stream-bottom substrates were observed almost immediately following the exclusion of Prochilodus. Moreover the composition of algal and invertebrate assemblages was significantly modified by Prochilodus. Taxa such as diatoms were reduced in number when Prochilodus was present; in contrast, Prochilodus appeared to facilitate nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. Total invertebrate densities were greatest in the Prochilodus removal treatment; however, a variety of responses to the experimental treatments was observed among different taxa analyzed individually, including density reductions, increases, and no measurable effects. This study suggests that the detritivore Prochilodus is a functionally dominant species in Andean foothill streams via sediment-processing activities. Moreover, it provides little evidence to support the notion that strongly interacting species are limited to simple systems with few food web components.

AB The role that pathogens play in structuring ecological communities needs to be examined from both a theoretical and empirical perspective. This paper provides a brief introduction to the ecology and epidemiology of brucellosis in Yellowstone National Park. Observed patterns of infection for brucellosis in bison in national parks in the United States suggest that Brucella has a relatively sharply defined threshold for establishment and that the proportion of the host population infected increases as a relatively simple function of population density, Unfortunately, the threshold population for Brucella establishment in bison is low, a herd of at feast 200 individuals; this makes it very hard to eradicate Brucella from wild populations. Simple calculations based on observed prevalence and recruitment data for the Yellowstone bison herd suggest that unacceptably high levels of culling would be required to eradicate brucellosis in the park.
   A simple mathematical model is used to describe aspects of the population dynamics of Brucella. The analyses suggest that an understanding of infectious disease dynamics is crucial to the management and conservation of wild and domestic ungulate species in and around national parks and other nature reserves. The consequences of disease control for the maintenance of biodiversity in other natural and captive communities need to be better understood.

AB We examined the effects of predatory and competitive interactions among three owl species on reproductive success and population composition of these raptors both experimentally and observationally. Eagle Owls (Bubo bubo, body mass approximate to 2700 g), Ural Owls (Strix uralensis, 900 g), and Tengmalm's Owls (Aegolius funereus, 130 g) coexist in Fennoscandia and feed mainly on small rodents. Predation may play an important role in interactions among these owl species, because Eagle Owls and Ural Owls can kill Tengmalm's Owls but cannot enter the small entrance hale of Tengmalm's Owl nest boxes. We asked (i) whether predation risk and interspecific competition due to Eagle Owls and Ural Owls reduced breeding density and fitness of Tengmalm's Owls, and (ii) whether these interactions increased intraspecific competition for safe nesting sites among Tengmalm's Owls. We manipulated breeding densities of potentially competing owls by erecting nest boxes, the control being boxes in areas where breeding attempts of competing owl species were absent. Control nest boxes in areas with no Eagle Owl and Ural Owl territories, and nest boxes within Eagle Owl territories, were used by breeding Tengmalm's Owls more than nest boxes within Ural Owl territories. Most breeding attempts of Tengmalm's Owls near Ural Owls failed during the courtship period. The observational data revealed that breeding frequency of Tengmalm's Owls was reduced and the mean start of egg laying was delayed by 11 d within 2 km of Ural Owl nests. In addition, male Tengmalm's Owls at these nests were younger and paired more often with short-winged (i.e., young and generally subdominant) females than when farther away from Ural Owl nests. Our results suggest that inexperienced male Tengmalm's Owls are forced to establish their territories in the vicinity of Ural Owls where they often paired with subdominant females. The areas near Ural Owl nests are suboptimal habitats fdr Tengmalm's Owls, whereas those near Eagle Owls are not. We conclude that predatory and competitive interactions from Ural Owls decrease the breeding population size of Tengmalm's Owls by reducing the suitable habitats. This is the first experimental demonstration that such interactions may decrease fitness of raptors.

AB Realistic models for ecological character displacement should incorporate population genetics. In Slatkin's pioneering model (Slatkin 1980), the genetics of the quantitative character determining the competitive interactions are modeled by assuming that the character is normally distributed in each generation. Only the mean and the variance of the character distributions change over time. With symmetric ecological assumptions for the two competing species, and with normally distributed resources that are equally used by both species, this model did not yield significant displacement. This has led to the belief that ecological asymmetries or constraints on resource use, e.g., by constraining the phenotypic variances, are necessary for character displacement. I argue that the reason for the negative result in Slatkin's original model is that the genetics are modeled too rigidly. With a more flexible genetic model, obtained by explicitly modeling many loci with additive effects, character displacement occurs as a rule even for symmetric ecological assumptions and without constraints on the phenotype distributions. The model can also be used in other contexts than competition for resources. For example, character displacement in a host-parasite system can lead to parasite specialization. The results suggest that more detailed genetic models yield a finer resolution of the interaction between population genetics and ecological dynamics. Explicit genetics lead to more insights than the usual quantitative genetic assumption of normal character distribution.

AB Three species of Darwin's finches (Geospiza fortis, G. scandens, and G. fuliginosa) hybridize rarely on the small Galapagos island of Daphne Major. Following the exceptionally severe El Nino event of 1982-1983, hybrids survived as well as, and in some cases better than, the parental species during dry seasons of potential food limitation. They also backcrossed to two of the parental species. This study was undertaken to compare the diets of hybrids with the diets of the parental species in order to assess possible reasons for the high hybrid survival. Diets of F-1 hybrids and first generation backcrosses to G. fortis were intermediate between the diets of the respective parental species. Distinctiveness of the hybrid diets was most pronounced where the diets of the parental species differed most. A strong determinant was beak morphology; hybrids inherit beak traits from both parents, and, on average, have intermediate beak sizes. Among the combined groups of species and hybrids, and among the hybrids alone, dietary characteristics covaried with beak morphology. Hybrids that differ most from G. fortis in beak morphology, the G. fortis x G. scandens F-1 hybrids, experience a feeding efficiency advantage when feeding on Opuntia echios seeds, commonly consumed in the dry season.
   These findings are used to interpret the higher survival of hybrids after 1983 than beforehand. The El Nino event that year led to an enduring (10-yr) change in the habitat and plant composition of the island. A decrease in absolute and relative abundance of large and hard seeds apparently caused relatively high mortality among G. scandens and the largest G. fortis individuals. Hybrids were favored by an abundance of small seeds. The high survival of G. fortis x G. scandens F-1 hybrids may have been due, additionally, to a broad diet and to efficient exploitation of Opuntia seeds. The study demonstrates long-term ecological and evolutionary consequences of large-scale fluctuations in climate, and the role of ecological (food) factors in determining hybrid fitness.

AB We examined the spatial distribution of soil nutrients in desert ecosystems of the southwestern United States to test the hypothesis that the invasion of semiarid grasslands by desert shrubs is associated with the development of ''islands of fertility'' under shrubs. In grasslands of the Chihuahuan Desert of New Mexico, 35-76% of the variation in soil N was found at distances <20 cm, which may be due to local accumulations of soil N under Bouteloua eriopoda, a perennial bunchgrass. The remaining variance is found over distances extending to 7 m, which is unlikely to be related to nutrient cycling by grasses. In adjacent shrublands, in which Larrea tridentata has replaced these grasses over the last century, soil N is more concentrated under shrubs and autocorrelated over distances extending 1.0-3.0 m, similar to mean shrub size and reflecting local nutrient cycling by shrubs. A similar pattern was seen in the shrublands of the Mojave Desert of California. Soil PO4, Cl, SO4, and K also accumulate under desert shrubs, whereas Rb, Na, Li, Ca, Mg, and Sr are usually more concentrated in the intershrub spaces. Changes in the distribution of soil properties may be a useful index of desertification in arid and semiarid grasslands worldwide.

AB Trade-offs are central to life history theory, yet few studies have examined how geographic variation in trade-offs can lead to geographic variation in life history characters. I examined whether or not trade-offs for future fecundity or offspring survivorship could explain why tropical birds lay smaller clutches than their temperate relatives. I studied a tropical population (in Monteverde, Costa Pica) of the House Wren (Troglodytes aedon), a species that ranges in average clutch size from 6 in the temperate zone to 3.5 in the tropics. Three years of brood manipulation experiments showed weak effects of brood size on both future fecundity and offspring survivorship. Females that raised broods enlarged by two nestlings laid subsequent clutches, in the same breeding season, that were one-third of an egg smaller than those of females that did not raise enlarged first broods. Clutches in the year following brood manipulation were about a half an egg smaller for females raising enlarged broods than for females raising control or reduced broods. However, brood manipulation had no effect on male or female survivorship in any year of the study, despite the observation that both sexes increased their foraging rate to compensate for rearing larger broods. In two of three years, House Wrens were able to raise enlarged broods just as successfully as control and reduced broods, as measured by fledgling mass and survivorship of nestlings and fledglings. In one year, nestlings in enlarged broods hedged lighter and had lower fledgling survival than those in control or reduced broods. Predation of broods was unrelated to brood size, so food limitation appeared to be the mechanism causing the trade-off between brood number and offspring production. The pattern in tropical House Wrens is similar to that found in many studies of temperate passerines: in most years, brood sizes larger than the modal brood size appear to produce the most offspring. Thus, the same mechanism that controls dutch size in temperate birds may be at work in the tropics, but the level at which clutch size is controlled is lower in tropical birds, resulting in smaller clutches.
   A population model based on demographic parameters measured in the study population showed that the trade-off for offspring survivorship had a greater influence on fitness than the trade-off for future fecundity. Also, the clutch size strategy accruing the highest fitness depended on temporally varying conditions for reproduction. A strategy of laying 5-6 eggs had higher fitness than laying smaller clutches in years when conditions were favorable for reproduction, but clutch sizes of 3-4 (the observed clutch sizes in Monteverde) were most productive during less favorable years. Depending on the frequency of favorable years, House Wrens may be responding to a ''bad-years effect'' by lowering variance in reproductive success to maximize fitness over the long term. Alternatively, tropical birds may lay fewer eggs so that they can invest more care in each offspring, enhancing the chance that their offspring will survive and compete successfully in social contests for breeding territories. This offspring-quality hypothesis is supported by the observation that tropical House Wrens devote more time to the different stages of the reproductive cycle than do temperate House Wrens.

ID LIFE-TABLE DATA; POPULATION-DYNAMICS
AB This paper reveals that key factor analysis, a popular method of life table analysis, cannot address the central issue of population dynamics: the pattern of population fluctuation and its causal mechanism.
   The basic idea of key factor analysis is to identify factors that contribute significantly to the variation in population. Several statistical methods to identify a key factor have subsequently been proposed in the literature. These are, in terms of the familiar relationship, K = k, + k(1) +...+ k(m), to correlate K with a k, regress K on a k, or regress a k on K, the last method being currently most frequently used.
   These methods, in effect, look for those k's whose variances and covariances constitute a significant part of the variance of K. The fundamental problem here is that the ''variation'' in population is inappropriately interpreted as the ''variance.'' I show that, in general, different factors play different roles in generating the pattern and that none of these aspects can be indicated merely by the variance of K and its components, the variances and covariances of the k's. I contend that, for judging which factor is major, criteria are multiple and subtle beyond the simplistic idea of key factors.

   CLIMATE CHANGE
AB The rate of evolution and the scope for phenotypic plasticity can be assessed by studying the adaptation of an introduced population to a new habitat and the response of established populations to progressive environmental change. Adult American shad (Alosa sapidissima), an introduced species, and sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a native species, migrate up the Columbia River (northwestern United States) in late spring and early summer to spawn. Based on records from Bonneville Dam, the river's spring warming has occurred progressively earlier since approximate to 1950, coinciding with a reduction in spring discharge. The date when 50% of the shad migrated past the dam is correlated with this shift in thermal and flow regimes; they now ascend the river approximate to 38 d earlier than they did in 1938. However, the mean temperature that they experience has actually decreased by 1.8 degrees C in 45 yr, indicating that the change in their migratory timing has outstripped the rate of environmental change. The upriver migration of sockeye salmon is also earlier than in past years, but their change in timing (approximate to 6 d since 1949) lags behind the rate of environmental change, and they are now experiencing approximate to 2.5 degrees C warmer temperatures than in past years. We hypothesize that the differences in response to changing environmental conditions between these species arise from differences in their migration patterns and early life histories. Shad spawn soon after they enter the river in its main stem where environmental conditions of the larvae will closely mirror those experienced by upstream-migrating adults. They may therefore have evolved a migratory pattern that allows greater behavioral response to environmental fluctuations than sockeye salmon, which spawn in distant locations many months after their upriver migration. Sockeye salmon migration may be more strongly controlled by innate responses to photoperiod, migrating at the time of year which is best on average because conditions in the lower river will not be indicative of those to be experienced by incubating embryos and juveniles.

AB A long-term field experiment in limestone grassland near Burton (North Derbyshire, United Kingdom) was designed to identify plant attributes and vegetation characteristics conducive to successful invasion. Plots containing crossed, continuous gradients of fertilizer addition and disturbance intensity were subjected to a single-seed inoculum comprising a wide range of plant functional types and 54 species not originally present at the site. Several disturbance treatments were applied; these included the creation of gaps of contrasting size and the mowing of the vegetation to different heights and at different times of the year. This paper analyzes the factors controlling the initial phase of the resulting invasions within the plots subject to gap creation.
   The susceptibility of the indigenous community to invasion was strongly related to the availability of bare ground created, but greatest success occurred where disturbance coincided with eutrophication. Disturbance damage to the indigenous dominants (particularly Festuca ovina) was an important determinant of seedling establishment by the sown invaders. Large seed size was identified as an important characteristic allowing certain species to establish relatively evenly across the productivity-disturbance matrix; smaller-seeded species were more dependent on disturbance for establishment. Successful and unsuccessful invaders were also distinguished to some extent by differences in germination requirements and present geographical distribution.
