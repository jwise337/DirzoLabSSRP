AB We investigated the response of two species of lady beetle, Coccinella 7-punctata and Hippodamia variegata, to spatial variation in the density of aphids on fireweed, Epilobium angustifolium. Our approach involved experimental manipulations of aphid densities and field observations of lady beetle foraging at three different scales: (1) individual lady beetles on individual fireweed stems, (2) populations of lady beetles on individual fireweed stems, and (3) populations of lady beetles in populations of fireweed stems. At the finest scale, we found that individual lady beetles remained on single fireweed stems longer in the presence of large aphid colonies. However, this behavioral response to aphid density was weak, explaining only 11 and 4% of the total variance in the length of time C, 7-punctata and H. variegata remained on the stems. To examine directly the population-level effects of this individual lady beetle behavior, we conducted a second series of experiments that focused on the response of populations of lady beetles; we released large numbers of lady beetles into field plots in which we had manipulated the number and size of aphid colonies. By sampling the distribution of lady beetles, we showed that the number of lady beetles found on fireweed stems depended significantly on the presence and size of aphid colonies. The average number of both C. 7-punctata and H. variegata found on a stem was 10-20 times greater when the stem contained a large aphid colony than when the stem contained no aphids. Finally, we examined the consequences of these patterns at the scale of populations of lady beetles and populations of fireweed in 25-m2 field plots. We found that the number and size of aphid colonies within the plots explained 50 and 90% of the variation among plots in the average length of time that C. 7-punctata and H. variegata remained. Taken together, these results demonstrate that although individual lady beetle response to aphid density is extremely weak, the cumulative effect of many individuals can produce strong population-level aggregation of lady beetles in areas of high aphid density.

AB We surveyed the fish community of a tropical watershed in the Northern Range Mountains of Trinidad and conducted experiments to test the hypothesis that species interactions structure the fish community. We censused the fish community at 86 sites, measuring each fish collected and recording physical variables for each site (pool size, substrate composition, cover, etc.). One member of the fauna, a killifish, Rivulus hartii, was widely distributed in the drainage, occurring alone in each headwater but also encountering other fish species below barrier waterfalls. This pattern allowed us to use Rivulus to test four predictions derived from the species interaction hypothesis: (1) Rivulus density (in grams per square metre) would be depressed at sites with other fish species present, when compared to the density expected from physical characteristics of each site as if Rivulus were alone; (2) Rivulus density would decline at points of contact with the piscivorous fish Hoplias malabaricus; (3) local populations of Rivulus found in pools occupied by the predator would show a smaller maximal size than in pools without the predator; and (4) the growth rate of Rivulus would be lowered in the event of a local invasion by the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, another abundant and sometimes co-occurring species in the watershed. The first three predictions were tested with data from the survey, while the fourth prediction was tested by experiments in a nearby stream.
   We used a factor analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the physical variables to four factors. A regression analysis of Rivulus density on the four factors, using 43 Rivulus-only pools, was used to predict Rivulus density in nine pools, each in a different tributary, in which Rivulus first encountered a second species after being the only species present upstream of this pool. The expected density was based solely on the physical characteristics of the pool and represented the expected Rivulus density purely from physical attributes, as if Rivulus were the only species present. Comparison of these expected densities with the actual Rivulus densities revealed a consistent negative impact of the presence of other species on Rivulus density, in support of Prediction 1. Overall, actual Rivulus densities at points of contact with other species were about one-third of the density expected if the other species were absent.
   The distribution of Rivulus was essentially complementary to that of the piscivorous fish, although only one site provided an unambiguous test of Prediction 2, since Hoplias did not ascend the tributaries in this watershed. The size distribution of Rivulus in populations occurring in pools with predators was dominated by small individuals, with none larger than the median size of Rivulus in predator-free populations, supporting Prediction 3. Finally, the competition experiments revealed that adult Poecilia depressed the growth rate of young Rivulus.
   We conclude that interspecific interactions are important in structuring the geographical distribution and abundance of Rivulus throughout this tropical watershed, and suggest that interspecific interactions can fragment Rivulus into local populations.

AB A computer model of forest growth and ecosystem processes is presented. The model, HYBRID, is derived from a forest gap model, an ecosystem process model, and a photosynthesis model. In HYBRID individual trees fix and respire carbon, and lose water daily; carbon partitioning occurs at the end of each year. HYBRID obviates many of the limitations of both gap models and ecosystem process models. The growth equations of gap models are replaced with functionally realistic equations and processes for carbon fixation and partitioning, resulting in a dynamic model in which competition and physiology play important roles.
   The model is used to predict ecosystem processes and dynamics in oak forests in Knoxville, Tennessee (USA), and pine forests in Missoula, Montana (USA) between the years 1910 and 1986. The simulated growth of individual trees and the overall ecosystem-level processes are very similar to observations. A sensitivity analysis performed for these sites showed that predictions of net primary productivity by HYBRID are most sensitive to the ratio of CO2 partial pressure between inside the leaf and the air, relative humidity, ambient CO2 partial pressure, precipitation, air temperature, tree allometry, respiration parameters, site soil water capacity, and a carbon storage parameter.

AB While continental-scale patterns of vegetation change during the Holocene clearly record the influence of climatic change, the factors governing change at the landscape scale are less clearly defined. In order to characterize the scales of processes determining vegetation patterns during the Holocene, we analyzed a network of 52 pollen sites in the upper Great Lakes region. Pollen percentage data for three dominant tree genera (pine, Pinus; oak, Quercus; birch, Betula) were interpolated from samples bracketing four target years (500, 2500, 4500, and 6500 yr BP).
   Smoothed isopoll maps of taxon abundance for each target year show broad trends in pollen abundance that correspond to climatic gradients. Residuals, representing the deviation of each pollen datum from the smoothed value, indicate the amount of spatial variation in pollen abundance independent of that already modeled as a broad gradient. The three genera differ in the magnitude and pattern of residual variation. Oak residuals are relatively small in magnitude, while pine and birch residuals are relatively large and show greater local variability in sign and magnitude. This indicates local variability in tree abundance, as pollen of all three taxa is readily dispersed by wind. Spatial correlograms, which summarize the strength of spatial autocorrelation as a function of distance between pairs of sites for a given taxon, were calculated separately for each target year and allow the quantification of the dominant scale of variability of each taxon. Oak correlograms corroborate the mapped data in indicating the dominance of region-wide trends. In contrast the birch and pine correlograms indicate that factors operating at scales of 150 to 300 km are as important as region-wide trends in governing pollen abundances. The structure of the correlograms for birch and pine pollen changes through time, with birch showing a more patchy spatial pattern in the mid-Holocene (4500 and 6500 yr BP) as compared to the late-Holocene (500 and 2500 yr BP). Pine, in contrast, shows a more strongly autocorrelated pattern in the mid-Holocene. Our results suggest that substrate, an environmental constraint on vegetation at scales of tens to hundreds of kilometres, has been important in governing the spatial distribution of birch and pine in the upper Great Lakes region. The changing distribution of birch and pine is attributed, in part, to changes in the relative abundance of ecologically dissimilar species within these genera. Further, these observations suggest that spatial scales of tree abundances are dynamic and that constraints imposed by substrate vary in importance in response to long-term climatic variation.

AB The energy costs and benefits of foraging were quantified for male and female fiddler crabs. Benefits accrued during foraging were calculated using patch-specific intake rates, combined with an analysis of the energy value of the food. Foraging costs per unit time were quantified by measuring O2 depletion of foraging animals. An energetics model constructed with these cost-benefit functions predicted the leaving rule, defined as the food concentration at which a crab should cease feeding in a patch, that maximized energy intake. A second model was designed for males feeding on fine (sieved) sediments, which reduced intake rate, and therefore changed foraging costs. Lastly, by building on a previous analysis of foraging mechanics, the model examined whether the structure of the foraging system constrains the ability of fiddler crabs to maximize energy intake. Analysis of sex-specific intake rates and foraging costs indicates that females, although experiencing greater costs, also had higher intake rates, than males. The model predicted that females should acquire more energy from foraging in a patch, and should display a lower leaving threshold than males. The leaving rule prediction was tested and confirmed; observed leaving thresholds for all three treatments (females, males, and males on fine sediments) were statistically indistinguishable from model predictions. As predicted by the model, males feeding on fine sediments responded to increased costs by displaying a higher leaving threshold, relative to males on unsieved sediments. A sensitivity analysis, performed by using the 95% confidence interval of O2 consumption to bracket foraging costs, indicated the model to be robust; leaving thresholds were extremely stable, with all three predicted thresholds remaining quite distinct, despite a 20% change in the cost function. Finally, the model showed that the architecture of the feeding system constrains the ability to implement energy maximizing strategies. Constraints are gender specific, and the associated energy penalty is frequently small.

AB I investigated allocation to sexual and asexual reproduction in the Jerusalem artichoke, Helianthus tuberosus L. (Asteraceae), a clonal pseudoannual that is an herbaceous ramet for one season, but propagates as a perennial through tubers that quickly dissociate from the parent plant.
   H. tuberosus ramets grown from tubers allocated 24% of their end-of-season biomass to tubers and 9% to sexual organs, with substantial variation attributable to four genetic lines cultured from eastern Iowa. Experimentally induced failure of sexual reproduction increased allocation to asexual reproduction under common garden conditions. Plants with inflorescence buds removed produced more (82 vs. 69) and larger (4.4 g vs. 3.8 g) tubers than those with unlimited sexual reproduction. Total biomass allocation to reproduction in plants receiving the bud-removal treatment was equivalent to combined allocation to sexual and asexual reproduction in plants that produced flower heads and achenes. This suggests a complete diversion of resources from sexual to asexual reproduction when sexual reproduction is thwarted. Aboveground plant size did not change with treatment.
   These results suggest a flexible life history that can respond to sexual failure resulting from low pollinator availability or damage to inflorescences from herbivory or weather, with enhanced facultative production of asexual tubers capable of sexual reproduction the following year. Hereditary variation in allocation leaves open the possibility of local adaptation.

AB The states to which multispecies communities can tend has been an important issue in ecology, but one in which rather little progress has been made at a theoretical level through lack of a tractable global theory of the dynamics. This paper explores the use of a global theory called ''permanence'' that indicates whether the boundary of a phase space is a repellor to orbits in the phase space. The theory is used to try to identify, at a qualitative level, the states to which solutions tend in the phase space of an arbitrary pool of species. We define a ''permanent state'' of the pool as a subset of the species that is permanent in its own right and uninvadable by any other species from the pool. A simple assembly rule for communities that stems from this is that no permanent state can be a subset of another. Data on coexistence of drosophilid species and also on that of cuckoo-doves, although incomplete, are consistent with this rule. A method is given for finding the permanent states of pools of species with Lotka-Volterra dynamics. Some properties of permanent states are illustrated by means of numerical examples from regional pools of species generated with Lotka-Volterra dynamics. These examples show three kinds of dynamics: a single permanent state, two or more alternative permanent states in which none are subsets of others, and an absence of any permanent states. The statistical distribution of these outcomes in pools of four and five species indicates that a single permanent state is the most likely one to occur, but that alternative states become more probable as the number of interactions among species increases. The implications of these results for understanding and modelling the process of succession driven by population dynamics are discussed.

AB Effective management of the Amazon's commercial fish populations requires an understanding of the factors controlling their production. A fundamental step in the investigation of fish production is to identify the plant groups that contribute energy to fish foodwebs.
   Stable isotope data for plants and 35 fish species were used to identify autotrophic carbon sources for the central Amazon fish community. Adult fish, aquatic macrophytes, tree parts, periphyton, and phytoplankton were collected in lakes and other flooded environments along the central Amazon floodplain and analyzed for carbon stable isotope composition  (deltaC-13) by mass spectroscopy.
   DeltaC-13 values for plants ranged from -39.4 to -11.9 parts per thousand with averages of -33.3, -28.8, -27.6, -26.2, and - 12.8 parts per thousand for phytoplankton, flooded forest trees, C3 aquatic macrophytes, periphyton, and C4 macrophytes, respectively. The average for all C3 Plants (phytoplankton, trees, C3 macrophytes, and periphyton) was -29.1 parts per thousand, while the average for C4 plants (mainly C4 macrophytes) was -12.8 parts per thousand. Mean deltaC-13 values for adult fish ranged from -37.0 to -19.8 parts per thousand with an average of -28.8 parts per thousand. Fish and plant data were used in an isotope mixing model to estimate the relative contribution of different plant groups to fish carbon. C4 macrophytes, which contributed over half of the primary production on the floodplain, accounted on average for only 2.5-17.6% (minimum to maximum) of the carbon in fish. The C3 plants, as a group, were the primary carbon source for 34 fish species, and accounted for an average of 82.4-97.5% of the carbon in all species. Phytoplankton, a minor C3 producer, accounted for a minimum of 36.6% of fish carbon on average, and was the principal carbon source for the commercially important characiform detritivores. Several alternative hypotheses are proposed to explain the apparent selective transfer of C3 carbon through Amazon fish foodchains.

AB Laboratory life table experiments using multiple clones of Daphnia galeata, D. hyalina, and D. galeata x hyalina hybrids quantified differences in niche breadth among these taxa along a gradient of food carbon levels (0.2-2.0 mg/L). Two-way analysis of variance revealed significant main effects (i.e., species, food level) for all life history features examined, as well as significant species x food level interactions for several life history characters (e.g., age at first reproduction and intrinsic rate of increase, r). Nested analysis of variance revealed significant species level effects for all life history characters examined, as well as significant clone level effects for all characters except r. Overall, species level effects explained approximately twice the proportion of the total variance for individual traits when compared with clone level effects (means of 32.8 and 15.8%, respectively). Significant interspecific differences in breadth of response (i.e., niche breadth) were observed for estimates of r. D. galeata exhibited a significantly greater niche breadth across food treatments than D. hyalina; D. galeata x hyalina showed an intermediate response breadth, which was not significantly different from either parental species. The existence of considerable intraspecific (i.e., clonal) variation in several life history traits, implies that any interpretation of life history variation among members of hybrid species complexes may depend critically on the genetic (clonal) make-up of the populations examined. These results are discussed in reference to the coexistence of these taxa in nature.

AB We examined the seasonal changes in plant chemical defenses of key tree species (Robinia pseudoacacia, Liriodendron tulipifera, Acer rubrum, and Cornus florida) regenerating during early succession in different patch sizes within Southern Appalachian forests. Trees of each species were sampled from five sizes of forest openings (0.016, 0.08, 0.4, 2.0, and 10 ha; two replicates each) and from the understory of surrounding forests. I-eaves of rapidly growing, pioneer species (Robinia and Liriodendron) were slightly less tough and contained lower levels of hydrolyzable tannins and total phenolics, but higher condensed tannin concentrations than the slower growing, more shade-tolerant species (Acer and Cornus). These results generally support earlier findings indicating the evolutionary development of greater levels of constitutive phenolics in slow-growing than fast-growing species. The differential use of condensed and hydrolyzable tannins by slow- and fast-growing species may reflect adaptive trade-offs in the allocation of different types of phenolics.
   Regenerating trees often had tougher leaves and contained higher levels of phenolics in large than small openings by midsummer. The differences in phenolics were more pronounced for condensed tannins and when comparing the smallest canopy openings with larger patch sizes. Plant phenolics were also generally lower in understory trees than in conspecific sprouts in openings. These findings may reflect phenotypic carbon/nutrient adjustments as light availability changes across the patch-size gradient. The greater sunlight in large than small openings apparently promotes excess carbon production and a metabolic buildup of phenolic compounds. Independent measures of phenolic compounds peaked at different times during the growing season. Hydrolyzable tannins reached peak levels quite early whereas condensed tannins increased later in the growing season. Total phenolics peaked in midsummer. Herbivore damage was consistently high (5-9%) on Robinia sprouts in all openings. Insect herbivory on the remaining three species (1-5%) was significantly lower in large than small patch sizes. Tree species regenerating in the high sunlight of larger openings in Southern Appalachian forests thus tend to have tougher leaves, contain greater phenolics, and experience less herbivore damage than conspecifics in small openings.

AB I examined spatial patterns of two populations of the clonal herb Aralia nudicaulis for evidence of spatial inhibition among neighboring ramets. Second-order spatial analysis revealed that ramet patterns of both populations were regular at local spatial scales, a result consistent with the proposition that localized, inter-ramet interactions are important in reducing spatial overlap. Localized ramet interactions suggest Markovian dependence, which is defined when an event (e.g., occurrence of a ramet) at X is dependent solely on the existence or otherwise of an event within a distance delta of X. Evidence of Markovian dependence in the populations was tested by fitting Markov point-process models to the observed ramet patterns. The populations conformed well to the Markov model, the results indicating that both ramet spatial patterns were Markov of range delta = 18 cm. This inhibition distance corresponds closely to the mean horizontal radius of an A. nudicaulis ramet, indicating that interactions occur at the spatial scale of the individual. I suggest that a likely mechanism for the development of locally regular spatial patterns in these populations is inter-ramet competition for a limiting resource, probably light.

AB Populations of several katydid species (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) show large differences in mating system; in some species males compete and females choose mates, whereas in others these courtship roles are reversed. Male katydids feed their mates during mating with a large, nutritious spermatophore. I hypothesized that courtship role reversal and increased sexual selection on females was a result of limitation in nutritious food items causing a decrease in the number of males available for mating (and thus in the spermatophore meals available). This hypothesis was tested by varying diet in field cages of Mormon crickets, Anabrus simplex. Results showed that, in contrast to a diet supplemented with proteinaceous food items, a poor diet resulted in: (1) a decrease in the number of sexually active males, (2) an increase in sexual selection for female body size, and (3) a reversal in the typical courtship roles. The experiment ruled out alternative explanations for variation in the mating system of this species, such as differences in population density and age. The conclusion from this study is that increased sexual selection on females due to such a change in diet is a result of an increase in the relative importance of male parental investment.

AB To improve our knowledge regarding plant responses to herbivory we subjected juvenile birches (Betula pubescens) to different types of simulated herbivory, i.e., removal of the top (I cm) of the main stem or defoliation (including removal of main stem top), and to different levels of intraspecific competition (i.e., three stand densities). Treatments were also repeated during the following year.
   Birch responses to these treatments were measured as changes in plant height and dry mass. Defoliated plants showed reduced growth irrespective of the level of intraspecific competition. Topped plants in the low-density plots showed enhanced growth, i.e., over-compensation, whereas topped plants growing in the high- and medium-density plots were unaffected by the treatments.
   Our results indicate that we should expect a continuum of plant responses to herbivory. Thus, there is little value in asking whether herbivory has a positive or negative effect on plant growth. Instead, emphasis should be placed on identifying conditions under which we would expect different responses.
   Further, we suggest that overcompensation should not generally be considered as an adaptive response that has evolved as a consequence of natural selection due to herbivory, but rather as an indirect consequence of selection for competitive ability. Because apical dominance (assumed to be an adaptation to competition) restricts growth, the growth mte will increase if apical dominance is removed.

AB Ontogenetic shifts in diet and habitat by the bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) separate its life history into two functionally distinct stages: juveniles, which are restricted by predators to feeding in vegetated littoral habitats, and adults, which feed on zooplankton (Daphnia) in the open water. Through comparative and experimental studies in natural lakes, we show how variation in Daphnia size and abundance has a strong impact on adult bluegill foraging gain and growth, and how the bluegill in turn influences Daphnia abundance and size. A two-life-stage model is used to predict how natural variation in Daphnia productivity among lakes should affect both adult and juvenile bluegill densities and growth rates. The model predicts that adult bluegill growth and density should be positively correlated among lakes, while juvenile growth and density should be negatively correlated in these same lakes. These predictions arise despite density dependence acting in each life-stage. A long-term data set on bluegill growth and abundance in a series of natural lakes supports these predictions.
   Finally, we consider what factors might drive variation in Daphnia abundance and size structure among lakes, and suggest that the volume (and/or productivity) of the hypolimnetic refuge available to Daphnia is a key factor. The strong interaction between adult bluegill and Daphnia, coupled with the bluegill's two-stage life history, provides an important mechanism by which the dynamics of littoral species (fish and their invertebrate resources) are coupled to the dynamics of open-water zooplankton.

AB Clones were isolated from natural populations with contrasting fish predation pressure and were tested for their phototactic behavior in the presence and absence of fish and/or fish-mediated chemicals. The presence of fish-mediated chemicals induced a more negatively phototactic behavior in all clones tested. This response was observed within 24 h after exposure to these chemicals. Release from the presence of the fish-mediated chemicals resulted for most clones in a gradual change back to control behavior, which took several days. There was no indication of a maternal effect. The response was not enhanced by a more direct exposure to the presence of fish, suggesting that the stimulus is a chemical.
   The results indicate genetic differences in responsiveness to fish-mediated chemicals in Daphnia. Clones isolated from habitats in which fish were present were on average more responsive than clones isolated from a fishless habitat. Significant genetic differences in phototactic behavior between the clones tested could be observed in the presence as well as in the absence of fish-mediated chemicals.

AB The purpose of this study was to compare forest structure on a series of geologically similar lava flows that differed in age, but not in climate or in accessibility to pioneer plants. The data were then used to infer the patterns of forest development over 3000 yr on a single flow. Stand structure was measured for populations of Metrosideros polymorpha, other canopy tree species, and tree ferns on a chronosequence of lava flows aged 47, 137, almost-equal-to 300, almost-equal-to 400, and almost-equal-to 3000 yr, in the montane rain forest zone on Mauna Loa, Hawaii. The upper stratum of vegetation at all sites was dominated by M. polymorpha; populations of other trees were relatively sparse throughout the study area. For M. polymorpha populations, the basal area per hectare increased, at an ever-decreasing rate, as flow age increased; population densities of seedlings, saplings, and trees peaked on the 137-yr flow, then declined, apparently through self-thinning and wind-throw, with further increases in flow age. The decrease in M. polymorpha population density on older flows was accompanied by an increase in the density of tree ferns, which formed a closed subcanopy on the 3000-yr flow, and may have inhibited regeneration of M. polymorpha. Among M. polymorpha trees there was a successional transition from pubescent varieties on the three youngest flows to glabrous varieties on the oldest flow. A comparison between plant populations on the chronosequence and on one other flow, aged almost-equal-to 1400 yr but containing some volcanic ash, indicated that ash may alter some aspects of forest development.

AB The post-glacial history of two adjacent sites in the Harvard Forest, a 10-ha swamp (Black Gum Swamp) and a 0.006-ha hollow (Hemlock Hollow) in a Tsuga canadensis forest were investigated using pollen analysis. The sites were selected in order to contrast the regional vegetation history revealed from the swamp sediments with the local history of the Tsuga forest reconstructed from the Hollow sediments. Specific objectives were (1) to document the natural and anthropogenic disturbance history, (2) to examine the long-term vegetation dynamics of the two sites resulting from environmental change, species migration, and disturbance, especially with respect to Tsuga, and (3) to contrast the pre- and post-settlement vegetation and environments. The Swamp and Hollow cores contain continuous sediment records covering the past 12 300 and 9500 yr, respectively. Regional vegetation changes are delimited in six pollen zones: I, Herb zone (12 500-11 800 yr BP); II, Picea zone (11 800-9350 yr BP); III, Pinus-Quercus zone (9350-8350 yr BP); IV, Tsuga-northern hardwoods zone (8350-1750 yr BP); V, Tsuga-Castanea-hardwoods zone (1750-200 yr BP); and, VI, Post-settlement zone (200 yr BP-present). No disturbances are detected in the periods of tundra or boreal vegetation from 12 500 to 8350 yr BP. Since 8350 yr BP three distinct disturbance processes are detectable: (1) fires recorded in discrete charcoal horizons, (2) the apparent pathogenic decline of Tsuga (4700-3500 yr BP) and the blight of Castanea (almost-equal-to 1915 A.D.), and (3) post-settlement forest cutting, burning, land clearance, and cultivation (1750 A.D. to present).
   Log-ratio diagrams facilitate the differentiation of local vegetation history in the Tsuga forest from the regional upland history. Tsuga has been the dominant taxon at the Hollow for the last 8000 yr although its abundance has fluctuated with disturbance. Tsuga, Ulmus, Populus, Acer rubrum, A. saccharum, Betula, and Castanea apparently are more abundant locally than in the regional vegetation, which has a larger component of Pinus, Quercus, and Carya. Post-disturbance vegetation dynamics in the Tsuga forest are controlled by the type and intensity of disturbance and the pool of available species, determined by species migration and climate change. Tsuga decreases and subsequently recovers in 300-1200 yr following most disturbances. Northern hardwood taxa (Acer saccharum, Fagus, Betula spp., Ulmus, Fraxinus) generally decrease after fire and human activity and recover with Tsuga. For the period 8000-3000 yr BP Pinus, Quercus, and occasionally Populus and Nyssa increase following fire and the Tsuga decline at 4700 yr BP. However, since its immigration at almost-equal-to 3000 yr BP Castanea has been the major species to increase upon disturbance of the Tsuga-northern hardwood forest. The study documents the long-term dominance of a forest stand by Tsuga canadensis and northern hardwood species despite repeated infrequent disturbances. The ability of these taxa to gradually reassume their former abundance following disturbance is presumably a consequence of their shade tolerance and longevity and the low frequency of disturbance.

AB Plant responses to herbivore damage vary enormously, but the causes of this variation are not well understood. We examined how both insect feeding style and soil fertility influence the severity of herbivore impacts, by measuring the effects of feeding by a leaf-chewing beetle (Trirhabda sp.), a xylem sap-feeding spittlebug (Philaenus spumarius), and a phloem sap-feeding aphid (Uroleucon caligatum) on growth and reproduction of goldenrod (Solidago altissima). Our goals were to determine (1) whether these three insects differentially affect plant fitness, (2) whether soil fertility affects a plant's ability to compensate for damage, and (3) whether soil fertility and insect feeding style interact in determining herbivore impacts. Plants were grown outdoors in large pots at two levels of soil fertility, and insects were placed on them at a range of densities. Insects fed on the plants for almost-equal-to 3 wk in spring, and then the plants were grown insect free for the rest of the season. We used insect mass gain per plant as the basis for comparing the effects of three insects, since the insects differed greatly in size.
   Spittlebug feeding reduced plant growth rates 3 times more than beetle feeding; aphid feeding had no detectable effect. The plants grew faster at higher soil fertility, but there was no interaction between insect impact and fertilizer level. Stem heights at the end of the season were increased by fertilizer and not affected by herbivory. Spittlebug feeding, and to a lesser extent aphid feeding, decreased the number of lateral stems, and again there was no interaction with soil fertility.
   Soil fertility had strong effects on plant sexual and asexual reproduction. Plants at the high level of soil fertility showed a three-fold increase in total seed production, a 5% increase in mean achene mass, almost a two-fold increase in rhizome mass, and increased percent nitrogen in seeds and rhizomes. Total seed production was reduced by herbivory. The pattern was the same as for plant growth rates; the spittlebug caused the strongest decrease, beetle feeding was second, and aphid feeding caused slight reductions. There was a strong interaction between insect impact and soil fertility. Total seed production was reduced only at the high level of soil fertility for all three insects. Spittlebug and beetle damage also delayed flowering, but only at the high level of soil fertility. Rhizome mass, mean achene mass, and percent nitrogen in seeds and rhizomes were not affected by herbivory.
   The common assumption that plants are better able to compensate for herbivore damage at higher levels of soil fertility must be reconsidered. This study also suggests that sexual reproduction may be more sensitive to damage than asexual reproduction in perennial plants.

AB Feeding deterrent effects of polyphenolic compounds from both terrestrial and marine environments have been well studied. However, the effects of this compound class on herbivore digestion and assimilation are less well known, particularly with respect to marine herbivores. This study found that the reduction of assimilation efficiency in Xiphister mucosus, a marine herbivorous fish, fed algae treated with marine polyphenolics (phlorotannins) was affected by phlorotannin molecular size (mass). In general, phlorotannins > 16.60 x 10(-21) g > 10 kDa) significantly decreased the assimilation of X. mucosus; those <8.30 x 10(-21) g < 5 kDa) rarely, if ever, had an effect. To determine the ecological relevance of these findings, phlorotannin molecular size profiles were completed for several temperate and tropical brown algal species. In all but one of the algal species examined, the phlorotannins were concentrated in the > 16.60 x 10(-21) g size range. Thus, the size range of phlorotannins that significantly reduced assimilation was also the size range in which they were most concentrated. This work supports the idea that polyphenolics as a chemical class do not all have the same bioactivity, but differ in their activity in a size-dependent manner. It also addresses some of the discrepancies seen in feeding-preference studies, providing an alternative explanation for results.

AB In the semiarid Intermountain West, boxelder, Acer negundo var. interior, a deciduous, dioecious tree, exhibits significant habitat-specific sex ratio biases. Although the overall sex ratio (male/female) does not deviate significantly from one, the sex ratio is significantly male biased (1.62) in drought-prone habitats, while it is significantly female biased (0.65) in moist, streamside habitats. The causes underlying gender-specific habitat associations in this species are not known. We hypothesized that spatial segregation of the sexes is maintained by differences in gender-specific photosynthetic behavior, water relations characteristics, and both instantaneous and integrated water-use efficiency. Gender-specific physiological characteristics were measured and related to growth, reproduction, population age structure, and habitat distribution of male and female trees.
   Under both field and controlled-environment conditions, males and females differed significantly in a number of physiological traits. Males maintained lower stomatal conductance to water vapor (g), transpiration (E), net carbon assimilation (A), leaf internal CO2 concentration (c(i)), carbon isotope discrimination (DELTA; an index of time-integrated c(i) and water-use efficiency), and higher instantaneous (A/E) and long-term (DELTA) water-use efficiency than females. Furthermore, male trees exhibited greater stomatal sensitivity to both declining soil water content and increasing leaf-to-air vapor pressure gradients, a measure of evaporative demand. Higher rates of carbon fixation in female trees were correlated with higher g, higher leaf nitrogen concentrations, and greater stomatal densities. For females growing in both wet and dry habitats, vegetative shoots had higher growth rates than reproductive shoots, while for males, growth rates of the two shoot types did not differ. In streamside habitats, female trees exhibited significantly greater vegetative shoot growth when compared to male trees. In contrast, males showed slightly greater vegetative and much greater reproductive shoot growth in non-streamside habitats. Regardless of habitat or growing conditions, females allocated proportionately more of their aboveground biomass to reproduction than did males.
   These results suggest that (1) gender-specific physiological traits can help explain the maintenance of habitat-specific sex ratio biases in A. negundo along a soil moisture gradient, and (2) that the combination of the gender-specific physiology, growth, and allocation differences contribute to differences in the size (=age) structure of male and female plants within the population. Gender-specific physiological differences may have evolved as a product of selection to meet significantly different costs associated with reproduction in male and female plants.

AB Dehesa ecosystems of the southwestern Iberian Peninsula are characterized as a savanna-like rangeland dominated by scattered mediterranean evergreen oak trees. We investigated whether isolated trees modify the water balance of this ecosystem and if so, what implications this finding might have on models that assume homogeneity of soil water resources. The water balance of the two ecological components of the dehesas-(1) the tree-grass component, and (2) the open areas between the tree canopies with unshaded grass vegetation-was studied for three consecutive years in three locations in the Sierra Norte de Sevilla region of Andalusia in southern Spain. In this region, annual rainfall was generally between 600 and 800 mm, and the summer drought lasted almost-equal-to 130 d. Soil water storage was measured with a neutron moisture gauge outside and under the tree canopy. Deep drainage between two consecutive census dates was calculated using field-measured drainage characteristics. Evapotranspiration (Ea) and surface runoff were computed from the water balance equation assuming that Ea is limited by Penman potential evapotranspiration.
   Monthly Ea by annual species in open areas was poorly correlated with rainfall levels in the autumn and was limited during the spring by availability of water in the top 40 cm of soil. During summer, monthly Ea by trees ranged from 30 to 50 mm. Mean annual Ea was 400 mm outside and 590 mm under the tree cover. In open areas, water yield (WY), defined as the sum of deep drainage and surface runoff, ranged from 65 to 100% of total Ea, whereas under the tree canopy WY was only 20 to 40% of the Ea. Under the tree canopy, when annual precipitation was < 570 mm, WY was negligible and all precipitation was lost by evapotranspiration. Outside the tree canopy, WY occurred as soon as annual precipitation exceeded 250 mm. Models of competition between trees and grass generally assume a spatial homogeneity of soil hydrodynamic properties. Our results, however, show that both soil water storage and evapotranspiration are greater for the tree-grass component. Consequently, these models must account for this spatial variability in water resources according to species.

AB The availability of resources for growth is believed to have a significant impact on the chemical defense of plants against herbivores. However, the means by which resource availability affects different plant traits, and the way in which these factors in turn affect diet selection, are not well understood. I addressed the relation between plant biomass, morphology, and tissue nutritional quality and browsing by moose (Alces alces (L.)) on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). In two experiments nutrient and light availability were manipulated and trees were subsequently exposed to free-ranging moose at feeding stations. Treatments included fertilization, shading, clipping, or root-cutting for 1-2 growing seasons. Treatments had a significant effect on tree height, twig biomass, shoot morphology, carbon/nitrogen ratio, and nitrogen concentration in current-year shoots. Twig biomass and shoot morphology explained most of the variation in per-tree twig biomass consumption by moose, whereas the carbon/nitrogen ratio had a significant impact only when between-treatment differences in biomass were removed. These findings show that variation in resource availability induces changes in a variety of plant traits other than tissue nutritional quality, to which moose respond by adjusting foraging behavior. This may have important implications for plant-animal interactions: the plants' chemical defense could be less effective against herbivores like moose that adjust foraging behavior at a variety of spatial and temporal scales.

AB The biodiversity of a site should depend on the interplay of local colonization (gain) and extinction (loss) rates, but few theoretical explanations of diversity patterns on productivity gradients have included effects of productivity on colonization. In an 11-yr study, experimental increases in productivity via nitrogen addition generally led to decreased species richness in four grassland fields Decreased diversity in productive plots was caused as much by lower rates of species gain as by greater rates of loss of existing species. Annual grasses and forbs had high gain and loss rates, but these were independent of productivity. In contrast, the rates of gain of perennial grass and forb species declined with productivity, and their rates of loss increased.
   Species richness was dependent on litter mass and on light penetration, but not on aboveground living plant mass, suggesting that there was no direct effect of productivity on diversity. Diversity in periodically burned prairie, which had low litter mass, was independent of productivity by the 10th and 11th yr of the study. Results suggest that diversity is lower in productive grasslands because accumulated litter, and possibly lower light penetration, inhibit germination and/or survival of seedlings, and thus decrease rates of establishment by new species. Higher productivity also leads to higher rates of loss, presumably via competitive displacement, of existing species. Results do not support the hypothesis that soil N heterogeneity controls diversity on the temporal and spatial scales of this study.

AB Experimental design should be accommodated to spatial heterogeneity in nature as well as indoors, whether it is a nuisance or a characteristic of interest, combined or not with assessment of treatment effects. The following analysis-of-variance approach to quantification of spatial heterogeneity is based on the adequate design of ecological field experiments, according to the type and the scale of heterogeneity of concern (at small scale, patches, one- or two-dimensional gradients). There are no recipes for doing so and judgment must be exercised every time; the experimenter's knowledge about the experimental material, combined with premanipulation or control, then, provides a useful prerequisite. For patches and environmental gradients, in the presence of treatment assignment, recommended designs require the blocking principle of grouping similar experimental units, which allows avoidance of spurious treatment effects and inflated error mean square. Completely randomized designs should only be used in the very particular case of spatial homogeneity at large scale. Illustrations in ecological field experimentation are given and discussed.

AB We conducted two experiments to determine the relative effects of herbivory and nutrients on an algal community in Walker Branch, a stream having effectively two trophic levels: primary producers and herbivorous snails. The first study (I 989), performed in streamside channels, tested the effects of three factors: (1) stream water nitrogen (N), (2) phosphorus (P), and (3) snail grazing, on periphyton biomass, productivity, and community composition. The second study (I 990), conducted in situ, tested the effects of snail grazing and nutrients (N + P). In the 1989 study, nutrients had positive effects, and herbivores had negative effects, on algal biomass (chlorophyll a, ash-free dry mass, total algal biovolume) and primary productivity (area- and chlorophyll-specific). Likewise, both nutrients and snail grazing exerted effects (+ and -, respectively) on biomass measured in the 1990 study (chlorophyll a, algal biovolume). Grazed communities were dominated by chlorophytes and cyanophytes, which were overgrown by diatoms when herbivores were removed. Algal species that were reduced most by herbivores were increased most by nutrient addition, and vice versa, suggesting a trade-off between resistance to herbivory and nutrient-saturated growth rates. Increases in algal biomass and productivity were slight with the addition of either N or P compared to responses observed when both nutrients were added together, suggesting that both nutrients were at growth-limiting levels. The greatest changes in periphyton structure or function were observed when both nutrients were added and simultaneously, grazers were removed, in contrast to lesser effects when nutrients were added under grazed conditions or grazers were removed at low nutrient levels, indicating dual control by both factors. Nutrient addition also positively affected snail growth in both experiments, indicating tight coupling between herbivore and algal growth (top-down effects) and that bottom-up factors that directly affected plant growth could also indirectly affect consumers belonging to higher trophic levels. Indices quantifying the direct effects of top-down factors relative to bottom-up factors (top-down index, TDI) and the importance of interactions between these factors (interaction coefficient, IC) were computed. These indices showed that the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up factors varied among biomass and productivity parameters and that top-down and bottom-up effects, alone, were less important than their combined effects.

AB The goal of this study was to measure directly the acquisition and allocation of energy for competing hummingbirds. In flight-cage trials providing an easily defensible food source, complete energy budgets (intake, expenditure, and storage) were obtained for two sympatric Costa Rican hummingbirds: a territorial (Amazilia saucerottei) and a low-reward traplining (Chlorostilbon canivetii) species. Behavior and energy responses of solitary birds (controls) were compared to the responses of conspecific and heterospecific pairs competing for a single feeder.
   Relative to controls, birds in pairs generally spent more time in flight, due primarily to increased rates of visiting the feeder or to agonistic encounters, with a consequent increase in energy expenditure. Ability of birds in pairs to compensate for increased expenditures by increasing intake, thus maintaining a constant body mass over 24 h, depended upon species and dominance status. The greatest asymmetries in energy effects occurred in heterospecific pairs, in which Amazilia aggressively interfered with access to the feeder by Chlorostilbon. In these trials, Amazilia boosted intake sufficiently to maintain adequate rates of energy storage; Chlorostilbon did not increase intake and thus suffered significant loss of energy stores. Conspecific pairs of each species experienced energy effects intermediate to the extreme responses of heterospecific pairs. Individuals of either species had greater energy success when paired with a Chlorostilbon rather than with an Amazilia. For both species, individuals that were relatively more aggressive than their cagemates experienced the greater energy success, though absolute frequency of aggression by an individual was a poor indicator of its energy success. Differential energy response to competition by Amazilia and Chlorostilbon appears to be one mechanism that contributes to local species abundance and guild composition.

AB Seedlings representing four families of European white birch (Betula pendula) were grown through their first growing season in two fertilization and three shading treatments. The growth responses of seedlings were measured, and after complete winter hardening the basal parts of seedlings were offered to voles (Microtus agrestis) and the top parts of the same seedlings were fed to hares (Lepus timidus). The growth response of 1-yr-old birch seedlings to fertilization and shading was family specific. Nitrogen fertilization generally increased the biomass accretion and the palatability of the seedlings to voles. Fertilization significantly decreased resistance of seedlings to hares in only one out of the four birch families. Shading decreased the biomass accretion of seedlings and increased their palatability to hares but tended to decrease the palatability to voles. The differing preferences of the two mammalian herbivores for seedlings grown under different environmental conditions may be due to vertical differences in the defense of birch seedlings to herbivore feeding. No trade-off was found between seedling defense and growth.

AB Details on the nature of density-dependent processes in desert annuals and their interaction with density-independent factors are critical to an understanding of adaptation to variable environments and the role of environmental variation in the maintenance of species coexistence. In this study we examined intra- and interspecific competitive interactions along a topographic gradient for two co-occurring species of desert winter annuals, Plantago patagonica and Pectocarya recurvata. This investigation was carried out in a creosote flat in the Sonoran Desert during 1987-1988, a growing season with high plant densities and low rainfall. Three stations were established along the topographic gradient: one in the sandy rivulets of a tertiary wash or arroyo, one in the sandy clay soil at the base of a small hill, and the third on the southeast side of the gently sloping (9-degrees) hill. The wash habitat had the greatest moisture availability (soil water potential) shortly after rainfall. Yet it dried out quickly, presumably due to greater evaporation and percolation, leaving the base of the hill with the greater average moisture availability. The slope had the lowest moisture availability. Competition experiments were set up at each station using a neighborhood design with varying density in either mono- or mixed cultures. Target plants were scored for survival, fecundity, and size. Plantago and Pectocarya were found to have equivalent competitive effects in all three habitats using either species as a target: the species identity of neighbors had no measurable effects so that competition coefficients appear to be equal. However, density-response curves had different slopes in the different habitats along the gradient: both species had flat density-response curves on the slope, while Plantago had its steepest curve in the wash and Pectocarya had its steepest curve at the base of the hill. While density-dependent processes were important determinants of success for these desert annuals in this low-rainfall year, the strength of the density response varied spatially. We argue that the habitat-density interactions that differ among species may promote their coexistence.

In some species, a subset of flowers are actually female-sterile and morphologically distinct; these flowers are presumed to enhance fitness primarily through pollen donation. Individual plants of the hummingbird-pollinated shrub Besleria triflora produce both long-styled and short-styled flower morphs, characteristic of these ''andromonoecious'' sexual systems. Short-styled flowers set fruit rarely when hand-pollinated and are therefore functionally staminate. To test the hypothesis that selection for increased male function maintains flower dimorphism, I measured relative pollen dispersal per unit investment by staminate vs. perfect (long-styled) flowers. In the field, anthers of perfect flowers dispersed pollen for a significantly longer time than did those of staminate flowers. In laboratory experiments, hummingbirds transferred more pollen per visit from perfect flowers than from staminate flowers, in part due to differences in flower-morph pollen production. As a result, perfect flowers dispersed substantially more pollen than staminate flowers over an average flower lifetime. The two flower morphs did not differ in the amount of biomass invested through the time of corolla abscission, suggesting that staminate flowers do not conserve resources substantially. These results fail to support the ''male-function'' hypothesis for the evolution of andromonoecy. Staminate flowers contribute relatively little to plant reproductive success directly through male function, suggesting they are maintained for reproductive functions other than pollen donation.

AB To assess the pattern and causes of community structure, we sampled 38 isolated springs in the Dalhousie Basin of South Australia to determine the distributions of five taxa of native fishes. We visited each spring on at least two consecutive days, used several collecting methods to determine the presence or absence of each taxon, and took standardized measurements of abiotic environmental variables. Community organization was highly predictable: (1) number of species increased with spring size, (2) each species occurred in nearly all springs larger than a certain size, and (3) species composition exhibited nearly perfect nestedness. These results suggest that much of the variation in the composition of other communities may not be stochastic. When the influence of historical and environmental factors can be assessed, the colonization-extinction processes and ecological relationships that determine community structure may be highly deterministic.

AB To evaluate the tendency of plant species to be arranged in hierarchies of competitive ability, Keddy and Shipley (1989) introduced a definition of competitive transitivity in multispecies competition matrices and developed an inferential statistic to test for such a pattern. Here, I introduce a more demanding definition of competitive transitivity (''complete transitivity'') that defines a strict hierarchy of competitive relationships and that has more desirable properties for inferring competitive exclusion. A null model, and its accompanying Monte Carlo test, is developed that can be used in analyzing empirical competition matrices. Ten published competition matrices are analyzed; nine show clear evidence of complete transitivity.

AB The consequences of complex trophic interactions for the dynamics of a natural microbenthic community from an intertidal Australian seagrass bed were examined during experiments in January, March, April, and June 1989. Effects of meiofauna and protist density manipulations on bacterial 'numbers and division rates and microalgal biomass were determined over 6 d each month. Results varied among experiments, microbial groups, and vertical positions within the sediment. Meiofaunal effects increased bacterial division rates but not densities in January subsurface and March surface sediments. In June, enhanced meiofaunal densities decreased subsurface but increased surface bacterial densities. A complex, tri-trophic-level interaction among meiofauna, protists, and bacteria probably caused the increased bacterial densities in June surface sediments. Meiofauna had no discernible effect on bacterial densities and division rates in January surface and March subsurface sediments even though relatively small (< 50%) differences between treatments could be detected with reasonable statistical power. Changes in microalgal biomass could not be attributed to experimental treatments, and meiofauna likely have a limited effect on microalgae in this intertidal seagrass habitat. Results indicate that the combined effects of meiofauna can alter microbial densities and growth rates and significantly affect microbenthic community structure. Spatial and temporal variability in the nature of trophic interactions will determine the cumulative effects of meiofauna on microbial communities.

AB We document the construction of a relatively large food web (44 species) from the island of St. Martin in the northern Lesser Antilles, and compare it with patterns observed in other, generally smaller food webs. In constructing this web, we integrate data from a variety of studies, many of which focussed on Anolis lizards and their vertebrate predators. In addition to determining the links between predators and prey, we estimate the frequencies of predation (the link strengths), and find an approximately bell-shaped distribution with a majority of links of intermediate frequencies. Some of the properties of this web contrast strongly with those of webs in the ECOWeB compilation. In particular, our analysis shows this web to possess an unusual richness of intermediate species (relative to top predators or basal species) and of links between those intermediate species. The number and lengths of chains are also unusually high, as is the degree of omnivory. Nor does this web match the predictions of the cascade model, which predicts even higher proportions of intermediate species and links between them, and even more numerous chains. It appears that these and other differences are not due simply to the large number of species involved here, but it is not yet clear whether they should be ascribed to the completeness with which some of the diets are known, to differences between the ways this and other webs were constructed, or to unique ecological conditions on the island of St. Martin.

AB In coniferous forests of Central Finland, tits (Paridae) and the Goldcrest (Regulus regulus) exploit nonrenewable resources in their group territories during the winter. Results of many studies have indicated that interspecific competition restricts the use of foraging sites in mixed-species winter flocks. However predation is a significant mortality factor in these species, and predation risk might also restrict the selection of foraging sites. The Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium passerinum) is the main diurnal predator of these small passerines during winter. Predation risk from the Pygmy Owl varies greatly with the availability of voles as alternative prey. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of predation risk on the use of foraging sites in coniferous forest tits during winter. I collected foraging data from Willow (Parus montanus) and Crested Tits (P. cristatus) during one winter when vole populations had crashed and another winter when vole density was high to see if predation risk affects the selection of foraging sites by these species. Both Willow and Crested Tits changed to foraging in the inner parts of coniferous trees after the vole populations had crashed and when the Pygmy Owls started to hunt the tits. Additionally, in both pine and birch Willow Tits moved towards the treetops under high predation risk. Since all the foraging shifts were towards sites that are regarded to be safest from predation risk, it seems that predation risk in addition to interspecific competition influences the use of foraging sites by tits in coniferous forest.

AB When species differ in their ability to cope with varying abiotic conditions, a change in an abiotic factor can potentially alter the outcome of biotic interactions. The purpose of this study was to examine this phenomenon. We tested the effects of an abiotic factor (pH) and two biotic factors (intraspecific and interspecific competition) on survival and growth to metamorphosis by larvae of two anurans (Hyla gratiosa and Hyla femoralis) in outdoor tanks. Two levels of pH (4.5 and 6.0) and three levels of density (0, 30, or 60 embryos per 580 L tank) of each species were arranged in a fractional factorial design and replicated three times.
   Larvae of H. gratiosa exhibited typical patterns of intraspecific density-dependent responses: as density increased, survival and size at metamorphosis decreased and larval period increased. The interactions of the abiotic factor and the biotic factors were complex in this experiment. The addition of H. femoralis at high pH caused decreased survival and increased larval period of H. gratiosa, but at low pH these negative effects were not detected. Variation in pH had no effect on the size at metamorphosis of H. gratiosa. Interspecific competition from H. femoralis caused decreased size at metamorphosis of H. gratiosa only at the high initial densities.
   Some of the responses of H. femoralis were different than those of H. gratiosa. In this species, intraspecific competition affected only the size at metamorphosis. Low pH increased the survival of H. femoralis, but had no effect by itself on any other trait. Increased conspecific density and pH interacted only in their effect on the size at metamorphosis of H. femoralis. Interspecific competition resulted in decreased size at metamorphosis but only increased larval period at the high initial densities. Interspecific competition at the high density interacted with pH to increase survival and size at metamorphosis at low pH in contrast to those results at high pH.
   Overall, the larval period was the response most strongly affected in H. gratiosa while for H. femoralis the size at metamorphosis was the most strongly affected. Hyla gratiosa had more negative impact on H. femoralis than vice versa. This may be due to the larger body size of H. gratiosa. Low pH enabled H. femoralis to compete more effectively, because the negative impact of H. gratiosa was lessened.
   Even in a relatively simple simulation, complex interactions occurred between biotic and abiotic factors. This finding demonstrates the importance of multi-factor analysis in furthering our understanding of the structure of assemblages.

AB The impact of dispersing juveniles on population and community dynamics is a topic of considerable debate, particularly for marine species with broadly dispersing larvae. We argue that sampling problems continue to pose a serious impediment to progress. The root of the problem is the large variation in dispersal dynamics over space and time. For short-distance dispersal the variance in dispersal has been largely ignored. By contrast, for long-distance dispersal the variance in dispersal may have been overemphasized due to the inappropriate time scales of sampling. We present data for an intertidal barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides, to contrast conclusions reached from standard sampling of long-distance juvenile dispersal with those reached by techniques that more appropriately integrate the dynamics of dispersers over time. The standard sampling approach misrepresents the true juvenile dynamics.

AB We investigated how resources are allocated to reproduction and how variations in resource availability influence reproductive allocation, offspring number, and offspring size in guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Our goal was to evaluate how plastic these variables are in response to environmental variation and to characterize the nature of this plasticity. Female guppies which had just given birth (litter 1) were assigned to either high or low levels of food availability until they gave birth to their next litter (litter 2, interval 1). They were then randomly reassigned to either high or low food with the constraint that there be equal numbers of individuals in each of four treatments: high-high, high-low, low-high, and low-low. They were maintained on this level of food availability until they produced their next litter (litter 3, interval 2). We analyzed variables that characterized the female after the birth of the third litter and the offspring in the third litter. These were two-way analyses, with intervals 1 and 2 as the main effects and high vs. low food as the levels of each effect.
   The qualities of the third litter were influenced by both interbrood intervals, indicating that the resources used for producing the litter were derived from both intervals. Specifically, higher food availability during either interval resulted in a significant increase in the number of offspring in litter 3, independent of the size of the mother. This result indicates that the number of offspring produced in a litter will be a function of both the immediate and the past environment. Lower food during either interval resulted in an increase in the number of days between the second and third litters, indicating that, if resource availability is low, the female may delay the initiation of the next litter, allowing her to acquire more resources. Resource availability during both intervals also influenced how resources were allocated to individual offspring. Females responded to low food during the first interbrood interval by producing heavier offspring in litter 3. This increase in mass was almost entirely attributable to an increase in fat reserves. Such a result could represent adaptive plasticity, if it can be demonstrated that maternal fitness increases through the production of heavier offspring in a low-food environment.

AB We describe the role of leaf-litter ants (Pheidole spp.) in the seed bank dynamics of several small-seeded shrubs in a Costa Rican lowland rain forest. These ants harvest seeds from frugivore feces and cache them in their nests in partially decomposed twigs. Most harvested seeds are eaten but some are placed in viable condition on refuse piles. From 24 to 38% of the colonies (depending on ant species) contain cached seeds and 25-32% have seeds on refuse piles. Experiments with captive colonies of Pheidole nebulosa and P. nigricula demonstrated that almost-equal-to 6% of harvested Miconia nervosa and M. centrodesma seeds are deposited on refuse piles. Because seeds generally retain viability longer than the nest twig remains intact, harvested seeds are not trapped inside twigs. Experimental plantings of 4-d-old Miconia nervosa seedlings on two types of substrate (ant refuse pile vs. topsoil) under two light levels (equivalent to small and large clearings) demonstrated that seedlings grew faster and survived better on refuse piles under light levels typical of small clearings. Light levels typical of large gaps are not necessarily advantageous for establishment of understory rain forest plants.
   These results illustrate the dynamic nature of a tropical soil seed bank and the complexity of plant-animal interactions that occur there. Ants are simultaneously antagonistic and mutualistic towards seeds, killing most but significantly benefiting some. This interaction is extremely common (Pheidole density > 300 individuals/m2) and likely influences plant recruitment patterns. Our results challenge the generalizations that small seeds are largely protected from predation because of their size, that post-dispersal seed harvesting is equivalent to seed predation, that competition among seedlings from a frugivore defecation is common, and that small seeds accumulate over long periods of time in the seed bank. We hypothesize that differential harvesting and treatment of seeds by ant species may be a mechanism underlying community-level patterns of regeneration in small-seeded plants. Also, the incidental benefits to uneaten seeds deposited on refuse piles provide additional evidence that myrmecochory evolved in plants that strengthened rare but consistent benefits of being harvested by ''granivorous'' ants.

AB Least-squares linear regression and multiple regression are among the most commonly used analytical techniques of ecologists. However, these techniques only address a portion of the possible applications of regression methods. We discuss two less commonly used regression analyses that could find wide application in ecology, logistic regression and LOWESS regression. Logistic regression is appropriate in cases where the dependent variable is categorical, dichotomous, or polychotomous. It can be used with continuous and/or discrete independent variables. Logistic regression is motivated by the underlying binomial or multinomial distribution of dichotomous and polychotomous dependent variables and transforms the data to explicitly model these distributions. Locally weighted regression scatterplot smoothing or LOWESS regression is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and independent variable when no single functional form will do. LOWESS regression is motivated by the assumption that neighboring values of the independent variable are the best indicators of the dependent variable in that range of independent values.

AB Previous studies in taxonomically diverse marine animals have established the general existence, and importance, of the olfactory sense in a wide variety of behavioral processes. Evidence suggests that the sense of smell mediates predatory search in many marine animals. Past investigations have not, however, been designed to link either the degree of successful olfactory-mediated search or guidance mechanisms with the hydraulic environment in which predatory activities naturally take place. In an effort to examine the interaction between hydrodynamics and chemoreception, we investigated predatory success and search strategies of blue crabs foraging in controlled hydrodynamic environments generated in a flume. Hydrodynamics were characterized by quantifying boundary layer shear velocity (u*) and roughness Reynolds number (Re*), two measures that describe the structure of boundary layer flows. Flow properties affected the ability of crabs to orient to odor plumes emanating from actively pumping infaunal bivalves (Mercenaria mercenaria). High flow speed or large sediment particle size increased boundary layer turbulence, thereby decreasing the success of crab chemo-orientation ability. In addition, high flow speed also lessened the probability that crabs contacted odor plumes. Thus, habitats with high flows can provide hydrodynamic refuges from olfactory-mediated predation. Because search ability is contingent on the magnitude of boundary layer turbulence, olfactory-mediated predation may also be ineffective in slow flows, if bottom roughness elements can generate sufficient turbulence. Further, search ability in blue crabs is extremely sensitive to small changes in benthic boundary layer structure. The presence of a thick viscous sublayer, dominated by quasilaminar flow, seems especially critical for successful location of an odor source by crabs. Benthic estuarine crustaceans inhabit an environment where flows are transitional between smooth- and rough-turbulent conditions. Accordingly, chemosensory systems appear geared primarily to extracting information from hydraulically smooth flows. These results indicate that mechanisms governing the physical transport of odor signals can have profound influences, not only on the development of sensory and behavioral mechanisms, but also on biotic interactions such as predation, which, in turn, can mediate community structure.

AB Body mass of migrant Rufous Hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) on refueling stopovers increased on average from 3.2 to 4.6 g over a period ranging from several days to 3 wk. In birds arriving with body masses below almost-equal-to 3.5 g, the initial period of mass gain was very slow. This slow gain was not explained by energy costs associated with territory establishment or learning to secure food, since it occurred even in years when nectar resources were superabundant and territoriality was nearly nonexistent. Data on body composition indicate that mass gain up to almost-equal-to 3.5 g was due to deposition of nonlipid body components, which we hypothesize to be proteins involved in rebuilding muscle catabolized during the last stage of the recent migratory flight. Following the initial phase of slow mass gain, an accelerating rise in body mass consisted entirely of lipid gain. On average, overnight mass loss decreased prior to migration, suggesting that nocturnal torpor facilitated lipid deposition. The slow phase of mass gain is a potentially important constraint on migrating hummingbirds, because if they deplete their fat stores and allow their body mass to fall below 3.5 g, they incur a substantial cost in terms of greatly increased time spent on the subsequent stopover.

AB Island biogeography theory attempts to explain and predict among-island variation in species richness. However, two islands with the same number of species may still differ from each other considerably in their species composition. In this study we test the hypothesis that among-island variation in species composition is predictable and can be related to the corresponding differences in distance to the mainland. We focus on woody plants inhabiting islands in the Clarks Hill Lake, a reservoir completed in 1954 on the Savannah River, between Georgia and South Carolina, USA. Two groups of islands were sampled: islands that were logged prior to the filling of the reservoir and islands that were not logged. Each island was surveyed for the presence of all tree and shrub species, and its distance from the mainland was determined. In both groups of islands, the degree to which two islands are similar in their species composition was negatively and significantly correlated with their difference in distance to the mainland. Species richness, however, was correlated with distance to the mainland only on logged islands. We conclude that geographic isolation may affect species composition on islands, and that such an effect may occur even in the absence of a corresponding effect on species richness.

AB We characterized factors controlling denitrification and quantified rates of N gas production by this process in a tallgrass prairie landscape in central Kansas. The experimental design included three land use classes (unburned, annually burned, and annually burned and grazed) in factorial combination with three slope positions (summit, back-slope, toe-slope), plus a cultivated site in a toe-slope position (10 sites total). Denitrification was measured using an acetylene-based soil core technique four times in 1987, once in early 1988, and six times in 1989. Cores were incubated under field-moist conditions and after amendment with water or water plus nitrate. Microbial biomass and nitrification and denitrification enzyme activities were also measured. Denitrification was higher (P < .05) in unburned sites than in burned, burned and grazed, and cultivated sites in both 1987/1988 and 1989. The cultivated site consistently had low rates of denitrification relative to the native prairie sites, even when water and nitrate were added. Levels of microbial biomass C and nitrification and denitrification enzyme activities were an order of magnitude lower in the cultivated site than in the native prairie sites. Denitrification rates were highest in the early spring of 1987 and were low at all other times. Although temporal patterns of activity were generally related to patterns of soil moisture, water additions did not stimulate activity in ungrazed prairie soils. Water plus nitrate additions consistently gave significant increases in activity. The results are consistent with previous research that has found that unburned prairie is wetter and has higher concentrations of NO3- in soil solution than burned sites. In certain years, denitrification may be significant to site fertility, landscape water quality, and atmospheric chemistry in the tallgrass prairie region.

AB Not all nitrogen (N) inputs have been accounted for in forested ecosystems. We sought to account for N2 fixation and dry deposition using a lysimeter mass-balance approach. Large sand-filled, field lysimeters were used to construct 5-yr nitrogen budgets for two N2-fixing trees, two pines, and a nonvegetated control soil. This approach is a promising and straightforward technique for quantifying otherwise difficult-to-measure fluxes. Accurate assessment of changes in N storage combined with direct measurement of N inputs in precipitation and losses from leaching allowed us to estimate fluxes. Gains of N in pine systems were greatest in vegetation and litter, overshadowing combined losses from mineral soil and leaching by about threefold. Rapid acetylene reduction in pine rhizospheres and in cultures from washed roots suggests that unexplained gains are due to associative N2 fixation. These results provide strong evidence for N2 fixation in pine systems of almost-equal-to 50 kg . ha-1 . yr-1 N. The symbiotic N2-fixing trees black locust and black alder fixed 2 and 5 times more N2, respectively, than did pines. In all systems, input in precipitation and dry deposition were relatively unimportant to the N budget. Unexplained losses of N from the nonvegetated control suggest that denitrification is an important flux. Mineral soil organic matter declined sharply and significantly in pines (20%) and even more so in the nonvegetated control (40%). Symbiotic N2-fixing trees caused a small, nonsignificant increase in mineral soil organic matter and large, significant increases in litter layer organic matter. Bulk density (0-20 cm) declined by 5% under symbiotic N2-fixing trees and increased by 5% in one pine sandbox. Correction for soil expansion or collapse did not greatly alter estimates of unexplained N or N2 fixation. Pines with rhizospheres that fix N2 at the rates we observed might be used to restore degraded land and to create silvicultural systems that are N self sufficient. We first need to better understand the microbiology, tree genetics, and soil conditions that lead to rapid N2 fixation in pine ecosystems.

AB A nutrient amendment experiment was conducted for two growing seasons in two alpine tundra communities to test the hypotheses that: (1) primary production is limited by nutrient availability, and (2) physiological and developmental constraints act to limit the responses of plants from a nutrient-poor community more than plants from a more nutrient-rich community to increases in nutrient availability. Experimental treatments consisted of N, P, and N+P amendments applied to plots in two physiognomically similar communities, dry and wet meadows. Extractable N and P from soils in nonfertilized control plots indicated that the wet meadow had higher N and P availability. Photosynthetic, nutrient uptake, and growth responses of the dominants in the two communities showed little difference in the relative capacity of these plants to respond to the nutrient additions. Aboveground production responses of the communities to the treatments indicated N availability was limiting to production in the dry meadow community while N and P availability colimited production in the wet meadow community. There was a greater production response to the N and N+P amendments in the dry meadow relative to the wet meadow, despite equivalent functional responses of the dominant species of both communities. The greater production response in the dry meadow was in part related to changes in community structure, with an increase in the proportion of graminoid and forb biomass, and a decrease in the proportion of community biomass made up by the dominant sedge Kobresia myosuroides. Species richness increased significantly in response to the N+P treatment in the dry meadow. Graminoid biomass increased significantly in the wet meadow N and N+P plots, while forb biomass decreased significantly, suggesting a competitive interaction for light. Thus, the difference in community response to nutrient amendments was not the result of functional changes at the leaf level of the dominant species, but rather was related to changes in community structure in the dry meadow, and to a shift from a nutrient to a light limitation of production in the wet meadow.

AB The local density of a plant population can influence both the number of pollinators attracted and the behavior (and thus pollination efficiency) of those that are. I present the results of a field experiment performed on Brassica kaber, a self-incompatible annual crucifer, designed to test for the existence of density effects in pollination and to separate the two major component effects: reductions in the quantity and in the quality of pollinator services. B. kaber plants were grown in fan-shaped density arrays in six floral backgrounds chosen to manipulate pollinator foraging behavior. Pollinators visiting focal plants behaved as generalists in backgrounds of the similar-flowered Brassica hirta, behaved as floral specialists where no alternative floral resources were provided (three treatments), and displayed a mixture of behaviors in two background plantings where dissimilar flowers were available. Pollinator visitation rates to focal B. kaber plants declined sharply at low density in all backgrounds except the similar flower (B. hirta) treatment. Widely spaced plants displayed significantly reduced seed-set in all backgrounds studied. The most dramatic density effects occurred where pollinators were induced to behave as generalists, suggesting that density-related declines in pollinator quality are more important than parallel declines in the quantity of visits.

AB Models of gap-phase regeneration in tropical wet forests are based primarily on studies of canopy trees. These paradigms are derived from studies of a small number of species whose life history traits place them easily into ''pioneer'' or ''climax'' species. Woody plants of the forest understory, subcanopy trees and shrubs, are known to affect significantly regeneration dynamics in treefall gaps, yet we lack fundamental information on life history characteristics of understory plants that could permit their incorporation into gap regeneration models. We investigated intra- and interspecific variability in early life history characteristics of understory Melastomataceae species of different growth forms and adult distributions from the lowland tropical rain forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We examined germination patterns in vitro (22 species), effects on germination of passage through birds (5 species), seedling establishment in the field (3 species), and growth in different light environments (8 species).
   Established seedlings were significantly more abundant in gaps than in nearby understory sites. This pattern was generally applicable to all melastomes studied, regardless of the habitat where adults were normally most abundant. Seedlings were more common in the root pits and on the root mounds of uprooted trees, even though there was less light available to the seedlings in these microsites than elsewhere in the gaps. In a series of germination trials in vitro, most seeds germinated readily within 1-2 wk. Comparisons of germination rates between seeds collected from bird droppings and seeds extracted from fruits by hand gave varied results. With one exception, seeds of shade-tolerant species germinated more slowly following passage through birds, while seeds from high-light-demanding species germinated more rapidly after passing through birds.
   Seeds of three common species were sown directly into different microsites within gaps and understory control sites. In contrast to the germination trials, emergence percentages in the field ranged from 4% in understory sites to 21% in gap centers. Survival after 1 yr was low (0.1%-0.4%). After 1 yr, these seedlings were small (< 2 cm tall) and produced few leaves. In similar light environments in the shade-house, melastome seedling survival was between 80% and 100%, and growth increased with increasing light levels from 2% (corresponding to understory sites) to 20% (small gap centers) of full sun. With the exception of two species common to abandoned pastures and river banks, the species used in the shade-house growth experiments did not show significant increases in growth with increases in light from 20% to 40%. Suites of early life history traits described for tropical tree species are not consistent with the variation in pattern seen within this one family of understory species.

AB Predators can have consequences on prey populations and communities that extend well beyond direct predator-induced mortality. Predator-prey interactions often affect prey feeding rates, growth rates, or fecundities, thereby significantly affecting reproductive success of prey adults. Thus, investigation of the sublethal fitness consequences of behavioral responses of prey to predators is essential to our understanding of the total impact of predators on prey populations and communities. Feeding (algal grazing) rates, growth rates, and fecundities of Baetis bicaudatus (Baetidae) larvae were measured in replicated circular flow-through stream channels to determine the sublethal consequences on fitness correlates of the presence of predatory stoneflies (Perlodidae). Gut fullness of 24-h starved Baetis larvae was measured using fluorometry after 24 h (short-term experiments) in four treatments: (1) ambient resource rocks and no predators, (2) low resource rocks and no predators, (3) ambient resource rocks and one female perlodid stonefly (Megarcys signata), or (4) Kogotus modestus whose mouthparts were glued to prevent lethal effects of predation. Mid-instar male and female Baetis larvae were reared for 3 wk until wing pad maturation (long-term experiments) and subjected to all but the Kogotus treatment. Predator avoidance significantly reduced levels of Baetis gut fullness, over the short term, to levels intermediate between the high and low resource treatments. Longer term residence with predatory stoneflies caused larvae of both male and female Baetis to mature at significantly smaller sizes than in the treatment with ambient food but no predators. Mayflies with predators matured at sizes similar to those held with low food levels over the long term. Interestingly, both starved larvae and those avoiding predators did not grow during the experimental period in contrast to about a 50% growth rate of larvae experiencing ambient food levels, but no predators. Similarly, egg biomass per mature female larva was significantly reduced in both starved and predator treatments. The proportion of total body mass allocated to eggs was only reduced in starved mayflies indicating that the females avoiding predators accrued less total mass, but allocated a similar proportion to eggs as did well-fed Baetis. These data convincingly demonstrate that predator avoidance can have dramatic consequences on mayfly fitness. The mechanism explaining those fitness consequences is probably a disruptive drift/swim response by Baetis to encounters with stoneflies, which reduces Baetis' feeding rates. If we accept the assumption that natural selection has shaped the foraging behavior of organisms to maximize fitness, foragers need to make decisions that maximize both survivorship (minimizing risk of predation) and fecundity. In mayflies fecundity is entirely a function of resource acquisition by the larvae, which makes them particularly vulnerable to such sublethal effects of predation. Nonetheless, we suspect that the types of sublethal costs of predator avoidance documented by this and other recent studies are nearly universal consequences of organisms foraging under predation risk.

AB Because plant litter decomposition is directly mediated by extracellular enzymes (ectoenzymes), analyses of the dynamics of their activity may clarify the mechanisms that link decomposition rates to substrate quality and nutrient availability. We investigated this possibility by placing arrays of white birch sticks at eight upland, riparian, and lotic sites on a forested watershed in northern New York. For 3 yr, samples were analyzed for mass loss, protein, total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and total phosphorus (TP) accumulation, and the activity of 11 classes of extracellular enzymes involved in C, N, and P cycling. The relationship between lignocellulase activity and mass loss did not differ among sites. TKN and TP immobilization exhibited some spatial variation; rates of accumulation per 1% loss of initial mass, estimated from linear regressions, ranged from 2.2 to 4.4 mug/g OM for TP and from 43 to 139 mug/g OM for TKN, with maximum concentrations reached at almost-equal-to 80% mass loss. The relationship between the activities of acid phosphatase (AcPase) and N- acetylglucosaminidase (NAGase), enzymes involved in the acquisition of P and N from organic sources, and mass loss displayed even greater variation among sites; the slopes of linear regressions relating mass loss and temporally integrated activity ranged from 0.0 1 9 to 0. 135 activity-months per mass loss point and 0. 107 to 0.77 5 activity-months per mass loss point, respectively, suggesting that edaphic rather than substrate quality factors were regulating activity. The extent of N limitation at each site was inferred by plotting TKN accumulation, defined as the slope of the linear regression TKN concentration vs. mass loss, in relation to NAGase activity accumulation, defined as the slope of the linear regression cumulative NAGase activity-months vs. mass loss. P limitation at each site was similarly assessed from an analogous plot of TP accumulation in relation to AcPase activity accumulation. Low N or P accumulation in conjunction with high acquisition activity was taken as an indication of nutrient limitation while the converse indicated surfeit. The diagrams suggested that decomposition at the upland hemlock and lotic sites, which displayed intermediate rates of OM loss (zero order k = 0.29 g/mo and 0.23 g/mo, respectively), was primarily N limited, while the riparian sites, which had the lowest rates of OM loss (k = 0.14 g/mo), appeared to be P limited. Relative to the others, OM loss at the upland deciduous sites (k = 0.38 g/mo) was not limited by either N or P. The concordance of field observations with predictions based on ectoenzyme regulation mechanisms suggest that enzyme activity assays in conjunction with nutrient concentration measurements may be a useful indicator of nutrient limitation. An economic model is proposed that directly links N and P availability to litter decomposition rates on the basis of microbial allocation of resources to extracellular enzyme production.

AB Seeds are known to serve as sources of preformed and metabolic water for desert rodents, but water loss to hygroscopic seeds has received little attention. Salivary water loss by yellow pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus) and Merriam's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys merriami) to Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) and antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) seeds was measured to determine its magnitude and potential importance. Chipmunks rapidly lost salivary water to individual seeds inserted into their cheek pouches. Jeffrey pine seeds (129 mg) absorbed 9.8 mg of water and bitterbrush seeds (36 mg) absorbed 4.6 mg of water when held in the cheek pouches for 15 min. Only 3-5% of this water can be reclaimed if the chipmunk eats the seed because most of the absorbed water resides in the inedible seed coat, which the animal discards. The kangaroo rats, which possess external, fur-lined cheek pouches, lost no water to seeds held in their cheek pouches for 15 min. Chipmunk salivary water loss to Jeffrey pine and bitterbrush seeds was equivalent to 19 and 59%, respectively, of the water (preformed plus metabolic water) contained in those seeds. Salivary water loss is a major and previously overlooked component of the water budgets of granivorous rodents with internal cheek pouches. The presence of fur-lined cheek pouches in heteromyid rodents (kangaroo rats, pocket mice, and kangaroo mice) may have contributed to the great success of these rodents in the deserts of North America by solving the problem of salivary water loss to the seeds they handle and store.

AB Selective foraging by moose on hardwoods and avoidance of conifers alters community composition and structure, which in turn can affect nutrient cycles and productivity. The effect of moose browsing on the nutrient cycles of boreal forests was studied using three 40-yr-old exclosures on Isle Royale, Michigan. Two alternative mechanisms by which moose affect ecosystems were tested: (1) moose depress both the quantity and quality of litter return to the soil, and hence N mineralization and net primary productivity, by browsing on hardwoods and avoiding conifers; (2) moose stimulate N mineralization, and hence net primary productivity, by opening the canopy and by dropping fecal pellets. Soil nutrient availability and microbial activity, including exchangeable cations, total carbon and nitrogen, nitrogen mineralization rates, and microbial respiration rates, were uniformly higher in exclosures than outside. These differences were more significant where browsing intensity was high and less often significant where browsing intensity was low. N mineralization in browsed plots declined with increasing moose consumption rates. Net primary production in exclosures and browsed plots was strongly correlated with N mineralization. N mineralization in turn was positively correlated with litter N return and negatively correlated with litter cellulose content. These differences in litter quantity and quality were caused by an increased abundance of unbrowsed spruce outside the exclosures. Moose pellets alone mineralized less N but more C than soil alone, but pellets combined with soil stimulated N and C mineralization more than the sum of the two separately. However, this did not appear to be sufficient to offset the depression in nitrogen and carbon mineralization in soil resulting from the increased abundance of unbrowsed spruce. We conclude that, in the long term, high rates of moose browsing depress N mineralization and net primary production through the indirect effects on recruitment into the tree stratum, and subsequent depression of litter N return and litter quality. These results suggest that the effects of herbivores on ecosystems may be amplified by positive feedbacks between plant litter and soil nutrient availability.

AB Clonal growth or vegetative propagation is widespread among plants, yet we still have no clear understanding of the circumstances under which it is favored over sexual reproduction (via seeds). Within some growth forms of rainforest plants (lianas, understory shrubs), vegetative propagation may be the primary means of regeneration. In this study, the mode and frequency of vegetative propagation in 30 co-occurring species of the tropical shrub genus Piper at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica was assessed through field observations made over several months. Piper species were found to propagate by several means, including stem sprouting, root sprouting, layering, and fragmentation. The mode and frequency of propagation varied significantly among habitats and among species. Shade-tolerant Piper species typical of mid- and late-successional habitats regenerated primarily by vegetative means, especially layering and fragmentation, while shade-intolerant, early-successional species appeared to reproduce and disperse primarily by seed. These differences among Piper species in regeneration mode were due not only to environment, but also to a genetic component, as indicated by experiments investigating the importance of one means of vegetative propagation, fragmentation, to Piper species from different successional habitats. A shadehouse experiment showed that early-successional species were less likely than late-successional species to regenerate from detached fragments, independent of light regime. This outcome was corroborated by a transplant experiment in forest understory and large gaps comparing fragment vs. seedling survival among five Piper species from different stages of succession over a 7-mo period. Almost none of the cuttings from early-successional species survived in either habitat. Species of later successional stages survived better as fragments in the understory than in gaps; however, surviving fragments grew larger in gaps. Almost no seedlings from experimentally planted seeds of any species survived in either gaps or understory. Natural seedlings of early-successional Piper species were frequently found in large treefall gaps and other disturbances, while seedlings of species from later succession were seldom found in any habitat.

AB Mate-searching has been hypothesized to influence the host preferences of small grazers, yet no previous field data have examined this idea. I examined the host preferences of Cyphoma gibbosum, a generalist gastropod that feeds on gorgonian corals, and tested if mate searching or oviposition preferences contributed to variation in host preferences. I constructed experimental reefs containing three species of gorgonian corals at uniform densities and placed snails on these reefs either alone or in groups of four. Half of the groups of snails were single-sexed while the other half contained two snails of each sex. I observed snail movements by conducting daily censuses of the reefs and constructed transition matrices describing the movements of snails in each treatment among the three species of coral.
   Snails showed preferences for some hosts over others, and these preferences varied due to both mate searching and oviposition. Snails preferred to occupy Briareum asbestinum over Plexaurella dichotoma or Pseudopterogorgia acerosa, but these preferences were strongly influenced by previous experience. Moreover, females tended to move from B. asbestinum to Plexaurella dichotoma to oviposit, and back to B. asbestinum afterwards. Finally, both males and females moved frequently towards members of the opposite sex, in order to copulate, which influenced their distribution among hosts.
   These data reveal that behaviors associated with mating can influence host preferences and need to be considered in understanding host utilization patterns.

AB Interactions among plants may be influenced by pests or parasites that differentially affect one competitor. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of fungal parasitism and insect herbivory, alone and in concert, on plant competitive interactions. The effects of fungal endophyte (Acremonium spp.) infection and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) herbivory on competitive interactions in one- and two-species mixtures of the grasses tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), red fescue (F. rubra), and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) were examined in greenhouse experiments. In general, herbivory reduced plant biomass whereas endophyte infection increased plant biomass. Endophyte-infected (E+) plants were less damaged by herbivory than uninfected (E-) plants of the same species. Studies on fall armyworm larval feeding and choice tests with the five grass species were generally consistent with the outcome of the competition experiments; E+ plants were less nutritious and less preferred than E- plants of the same species. There were significant interactions among factors so that the outcome of competition depended on the species identities and the presence or absence of endophytes and herbivores. In competition with Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), E+ and E- perennial ryegrass produced similar biomass in the absence of herbivory, but E+ perennial ryegrass had nearly twice the biomass of E- plants when herbivores were present. E+ and E- tall fescue were poor competitors with orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata) when herbivores were absent, but E+ tall fescue was a better competitor than E- plants and orchard grass when herbivores were present. This study indicates that competitive hierarchies among grasses are altered by interactions with insect herbivores and fungal endophytes, which have typically been ignored in past studies.

AB Killer whales live in stable social groups, called ''pods.'' It has been suggested that the structure of such groups may influence the vital rates, and hence the fitness, of their members. To test this suggestion we used data from a long-term study of killer whales in the Pacific Northwest (Bigg et al. 1990). We constructed stage-classified matrix population models for the entire population, two sub-populations, and individuals pods. The population growth rate for the entire population is lambda = 1.0254, with 90% bootstrap confidence interval from 1.0178 to 1.0322. The mean female population stage distribution is not significantly different from the predicted stable stage distribution. Population growth rate is most sensitive to changes in adult and juvenile survival, followed by fertility. Factors that cause even small changes in survival will thus have a large impact on population growth. Pod-specific growth rates range from lambda = 0.9949 to lambda = 1.0498.  Most of the interpod variance in growth rate is due to variance in adult reproductive output. Randomization tests show that this variance is not significantly greater than expected on the basis of variation in individual life histories within the population. We conclude that there is no evidence for an effect of social structure on pod-specific population growth rate. The restriction of population growth rates to such a narrow range suggests, but does not prove, a possible role for density-dependent processes.

AB We examined emergence of male and female 13-yr periodical cicadas (Brood XIX) and mortality, due to avian predation, fungal infection (Massospora cicadina), environmental factors, and senescence. We compared relative contributions of the sources of mortality, and determined the temporal pattern of avian predation associated with predator satiation and mortality. Based on a mean density of 6.65 emergence holes/m2, we estimated that 1 063 300 cicadas emerged on our 16-ha study area in northwestern Arkansas during May 1985. Males appeared first in emergence traps in early May and emerged more synchronously than did females. About 50% of the population emerged during four consecutive nights, and peak abundance of adult cicadas occurred in late May. Based on samples from mortality traps, at least 40% of the population died in severe thunderstorms during the first week of June, demonstrating that stochastic factors can be major influences on periodical cicada populations. Fungal infection was not a major source of mortality.
   The first cicadas that emerged in early May were eaten by birds, but avian predators became satiated. Birds consumed 15-40% of the standing crop at low cicada densities, but very little of the standing crop was consumed when cicada densities were > 24 000 individuals/ha on the study site. Avian predators appeared to be satiated for several weeks, and by the time their foraging activities increased due to demands imposed by feeding young, density of adult cicadas was relatively low. Mortality due to predation gradually increased to near 100% as the density of adult cicadas declined in June. Based on estimates of cicada emergence and deaths due to avian predation where adult cicada activity was greatest, birds consumed only almost-equal-to 15% of the adult cicada population. Therefore, only a small proportion of the adult cicada population was actually consumed by avian predators. These results demonstrate that, indeed, the synchronized, explosive emergences of periodical cicadas may be classical examples of predator satiation.

AB We examined the relation between surface activity and the surface microclimate in thirteen-lined ground squirrels. We statistically isolated the effects of thermal conditions on squirrel activity and tested the suitability of two optimization models for predicting thermoregulatory behavior. Metabolic and microclimatic data were used to represent thermal conditions as standard operative temperature. The proportion of time spent on the surface was highest at standard operative temperatures between 30-degrees and 40-degrees-C. This range approximately matched the squirrel's physiological thermal neutral zone. This pattern was not qualitatively altered by using a multiple-regression model to remove the effects of potential confounding variables (e.g., time of day or time of year). At low temperature, the observed reduction in surface activity resulted in lost foraging benefits almost-equal-to 6 times as great as the energy savings in thermoregulatory and activity costs. Therefore, we believe that these squirrels cannot be considered daily energy maximizers. Rather, optimization must be considered in the context of longer time periods. At high temperatures, the observed reduction in surface activity was described by a constrained thermal model of shuttling thermoregulation, which assumed squirrels maximized surface feeding time. The model also explained a systematic decline in body temperature when exiting and entering the burrow as surface operative temperature increased.

AB We studied the influence of litter quality on the decomposition rate of leaves from nine Mediterranean shrubs and trees using litter bag methods for a 2-yr Period at two ecosystems in southwest Spain. Linear and nonlinear regressions were calculated between mass loss and the concentrations of the major organic and inorganic constituents of leaves (lipin, cutin, cellulose, tannins, crude fat, soluble carbohydrates, nitrogen, and phosphorus) and between mass loss and leaf toughness in order to determine the best predictor of leaf litter decomposition in these ecosystems. In addition, ratios between some of the litter quality parameters were examined as mass loss predictors.
   Loss of soluble components from leaves was used to define two phases of decomposition: a leaching phase that lasted 2-4 mo and a postleaching phase. Leaf toughness and the ratio of toughness: phosphorus concentration were the best indicators of mass loss during the leaching phase in both ecosystems, and cutin: nitrogen or cutin: phosphorus ratios were the best predictors of mass loss in the postleaching phase, but only in the drier and more nutrient-poor ecosystem. When the two phases were combined, leaf toughness, toughness: nitrogen, and/or cutin: nitrogen significantly explained the mass loss in both ecosystems.

AB Experiments were conducted over several years to assess the effects of the three most abundant herbivores (a thrips, a spittlebug, and a plume moth) on the growth and reproduction of their long-lived, iteroparous host plant. In a greenhouse experiment, thrips reduced root biomass of seedlings, but not shoot biomass. No correlation was found between density of thrips and change in aboveground area of plants after monitoring for 3 yr in the field. Thrips fed on the phyllaries and corollas of flower heads, as well as on leaves, and were particularly damaging to ray petals. Placed in artificial arrays, flower heads with rays damaged by thrips were less likely to be visited by pollinators than were undamaged flower heads.
   Plants in a common garden were subjected to three seasons of feeding by either spittle-bugs, plume moth caterpillars, both, or neither. Survival, growth, and flower production were measured for those 3 yr and for an additional 3 yr following the herbivory treatments. Plant survival was unaffected by these insect herbivores, although gophers (Thomomys bottae) were a major source of mortality. Plants with caterpillars produced more rosettes than those without moths. By consuming apical buds the caterpillars released axillary buds, thereby causing plants to produce more side rosettes. This difference in architecture did not result in an increase in flower production. Plants that had experienced 3 yr of spittle-bug or caterpillar attack produced fewer flower heads than controls during their 3rd yr. One year later, and after the herbivory treatments were discontinued, plants that had been damaged by spittlebugs (but not plume moth caterpillars) still produced fewer flowers than those in other treatments. Thereafter, no long-term effects of herbivory could be detected.
   All three herbivores were found to adversely affect some components of plant growth and reproduction. Because they are consistently abundant at Bodega Bay, these herbivores may reduce the fitness of their host plant.

AB Unprecedented rates of deforestation and biomass burning in tropical dry forests are dramatically influencing biogeochemical cycles, resulting in resource depletion, declines in biodiversity, and atmospheric pollution. We quantified the effects of deforestation and varying levels of slash-fire severity on nutrient losses and redistribution in a second-growth tropical dry forest (''Caatinga'') near Serra Talhada, Pernambuco, Brazil. Total aboveground biomass prior to burning was almost-equal-to 74 Mg/ha. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were highest in litter, leaves attached to slash, and fine wood debris (<0.64 cm diameter). While these components comprised only 30% of the prefire aboveground biomass, they accounted for almost-equal-to 60% of the aboveground pools of N and P. Three experimental fires were conducted during the 1989 burning season. In these treatments consumption was 78, 88, and 95% of the total aboveground biomass. As much as 96% of the prefire aboveground N and C pools and 56% of the prefire aboveground P pool was lost during combustion processes. Nitrogen losses exceeded 500 kg/ha and P losses exceeded 20 kg/ha in the fires of the greatest severity. With increasing fire severity, the concentrations of N and P in ash decreased while the concentration of Ca increased. This indicates greater amounts of these nutrients were volatilized (i.e., greater ecosystem losses occurred) with increasing fire severity. Following fire, up to 47% of the residual aboveground N and 84% of the residual aboveground P were in the form of ash, which was quickly lost from the site via wind erosion. Fires appeared to have a minor immediate effect on total N, C, or P in the soils. However, soils in forests with no history of cultivation had significantly higher concentrations of C and P than second-growth forests. Based upon the measured losses of nutrients from these single slash-burning events, it would likely require a century or more of fallow for reaccumulation to occur. However, current fallow periods in this region are 15 yr or less.

AB Phosphorus (P) is considered, except for sodium, to be the most limiting mineral for growth and reproduction in large mammalian herbivores worldwide and a predictor of ungulate distribution and abundance.  Knowledge of phosphorus nutrition and seasonal adaptation to dynamics in mineral needs and availability in wild herbivores is incomplete. This paper reports data on experiments designed to evaluate physiological responses to low dietary P and to determine phosphorus requirements in male white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), a browsing cervid with presumed elevated mineral requirements during antlerogenesis. Adult (greater-than-or-equal-to 2 yr) male deer were housed individually and placed on three levels of dietary P (0.14-0.19%, 0.24-0.27%, and 0.34-0.36% of diet dry mass) from June 1989 to September 1991. We conducted balance trials to measure seasonal P retention and to model annual and seasonal dietary P requirements. Data were collected on serum chemistry, endocrine function, antler growth, antler composition, and tail bone composition in two trials designed to test the hypothesis that P is limiting to deer antler growth in southwestern habitats.
   Phosphorus balance varied by diet and tended to fluctuate seasonally. Retention was highest for the 0.19% P diet and greatest during the fall. The variation in P balance resulted from increased efficiency in P metabolism in animals on the 0.14-0.19% P diet. Dietary phosphorus requirements were estimated at 72.2 mg.kg-0.75.d-1 (0.14% P at study intake rates) on an annual basis, changing seasonally from 94.4 mg.kg-0.75.d-1 (0.16%) during spring to 57.4 mg.kg-0.75.d-1 (0.11%), and 59.6 mg.kg-0.75.d-1 (0.12%) during summer and fall, respectively.
   Feed consumption, body mass, antler size and composition, and bone composition did not vary by diet. Diet x month interactions were observed in 1990 and 1991 for serum activity of alkaline phosphatase (AP), manifested in higher activity on the 0.14-0.19% P diet during the peak period of antler growth. Changes in AP were an indicator of physiological compensation to low dietary P. Other key serum chemistries and hormonal concentrations did not vary by diet. These results suggest that P limitation for antler growth is unlikely for adult browsing cervids. We predict sensitivity of the distribution and abundance of male cervids to P limitation to be a function of feeding strategy and body size.

AB I studied sources of density dependence in a dragonfly population to reveal how population size is controlled. Larvae of the dragonfly Aeshna juncea, inhabiting rock pools on the Lake Superior shoreline at Isle Royale, Michigan, USA, showed clear evidence of competition when natural densities were high. After 2 yr of larval growth, individuals in crowded pools were developmentally delayed and survived less well than individuals in sparsely populated pools. The stunted larvae caught up with individuals in less crowded pools and reached the final instar in sufficient time to emerge in the summer of their 3rd yr, but even so their final body size remained relatively small. A 5-wk field experiment in natural pools demonstrated the causal connection between density and fitness: feeding activity and growth rates were significantly reduced under crowded conditions, but survival showed no response to density. In unmanipulated rock pools, however, natural increases in density from one year to the next were met with slightly overcompensatory decreases in annual survival. The results illustrate that density dependence operates in a way that could contribute to population regulation in A. juncea, and a 6-yr time series from one of the two study areas showed significant evidence for density-dependent dynamics.

AB McNab (1986, 1988) has hypothesized that mammals using food with low energy content should exhibit basal metabolic rates (BMR) lower than those expected on the basis of their body mass (m(b)). That is, those species that exploit food with low energy content and/or high cost of digestion tend to have low, mass-independent metabolic rates. To date there is not an experimental test of this pattern. The aim of this work was to examine experimentally the effect of diet quality on BMR, digestive efficiency, and the relationship between digestion and energy expenditure in a small herbivorous mammal. We used as a model the herbivorous caviomorph burrowing rodent Octodon degus (m(b) nearly 200 g), an inhabitant of semi-arid and mediterranean communities of nor-them and central Chile.
   Individuals maintained during 27 wk with a diet high in dietary fiber showed significantly lower BMRs (28%) than those feeding on low fiber. Daily food intake and ingestion rates (energy and dry matter) of individuals under a high-fiber diet were significantly higher than animals maintained with a low-fiber diet. The same pattern was obtained for total feces production and rate of feces production. The total intake and rate of ingestion of proteins were not significantly different between treatments. However, a significantly higher amount of protein was excreted by the individuals exposed to a high-fiber diet. Apparent digestibility of dry matter, energy, and protein were consistently lower in individuals maintained with high fiber. However, nonsignificant differences were observed between gut contents in the two treatments (P > .58), but a significantly higher digesta turnover rate was observed in animals exposed to a high-fiber diet (P < .05). A significant correlation was found between digestibility and the basal metabolic rate of individuals (r(s) = 0.781, P < .01), suggesting that elevated digestibilities on high-quality diets allow increased basal rates of metabolism. We suggest that, although small mammals like degus may select sparsely distributed plants of high quality in their habitat, their capability to drop their metabolic demands may help them meet their nutritional and energy requirements when nutritional conditions in the environment deteriorate.

AB We present a model to examine how foragers should divide attention among different potential prey types in order to maximize their net rate of energy intake. We define attention as the brain's capacity to process information simultaneously. Our model is based on neuropsychological studies suggesting first, that predators who divide attention among an increasing number of different prey types decrease their ability to detect any given type, and second, that this decrease is larger when prey items are more difficult to detect. Our model also incorporates the effects of search rate on foragers' probability to detect prey. The model predicts that foragers encountering cryptic prey should devote all attention to a single prey type. When encountering conspicuous prey, foragers should divide attention among the different prey types. For prey types that differ in conspicuousness but are equal in energy content, handling time, and density, foragers should give more attention to the more conspicuous prey if the conspicuousness values of all prey types are relatively small. However, when all prey are more conspicuous, foragers should devote more attention to the less conspicuous prey type. We suggest that our model may serve to explain and predict some of the foraging decisions of animals searching for cryptic or conspicuous prey, and especially studies on ''search image'' formation.

AB Physiological rates of individual organisms are well related to their body size. These allometric relationships suggest that ecological rates should also be related to the size structure of organisms in populations, communities, and ecosystems. We describe size distributions of zooplankton communities and explore the implications of such distributions on community grazing rates. Ninety zooplankton communities, varying in biomass and in size distributions, were sampled in 28 lakes in northeastern North America and their grazing rates were predicted with an allometric equation. Zooplankton size distributions vary in shape but, on average, can be described as bimodal. Predicted community mass-specific grazing rate decreases with increasing mean body size (r2 = 0.92) and is only slightly affected by the shape of community size distributions. Community biomass on the other hand increases with mean body size (r2 = 0.39). Total zooplankton grazing mte is expected to be higher in communities dominated by large zooplankton, but this relationship is obscured (r2 = 0. 1 5) by temporal and spatial variability in zooplankton biomass. Although body size is a powerful predictor of individual physiological rates, its importance is expected to be largely masked at the level of communities.

AB A complete understanding of life history evolution requires an appreciation for the influence of natural selection and genetic variation on intrapopulational phenotypic variation in key life history traits. Experimental manipulation provides particularly useful insight into the biological importance of this variation. Consequently, I undertook a field experiment in which I manipulated body size and evaluated selective predation in order to investigate the ecological and evolutionary significance of phenotypic variation in hatchling turtles. I incubated eggs from 17 clutches of common snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) on wet and dry substrates, producing ''large'' and ''small'' hatchlings, respectively. Hatchlings were individually marked, measured, and then released simultaneously at a typical nest site in a National Wildlife Refuge area, Whiteside County, Illinois from which the eggs were collected originally. Subsequently, hatchlings were recaptured in drift fences erected along the edge of the Mississippi River.
   Sixty-six of 112 hatchling C serpentina were recaptured. Survivorship was not related to clutch, incubation conditions, or locomotor performance, but was significantly size dependent. Natural selection favored larger hatchlings. The strength of selection acting directly on three size traits, as measured by standardized selection gradients (beta'), was 0.327 (PC1 [principal component 1] = overall size and mass), 0.282 (PC3 = plastron length), and 0.162 (PC4 = trade-off between hatchling mass and width). The opportunity for selection was moderate (I = 0.703), but did not constrain selection. Full-sib heritabilities of body size of hatchling turtles were variable (h2wet = 0.72 +/- 0.34 and h2dry = 0.17 +/- 0.28), but were not significantly different between the two moisture treatments.
   These results provide support for the ''bigger is better'' hypothesis. Larger hatchling Chelydra serpentina exhibited significantly greater survivorship than smaller individuals during movement from the nest site to water. However, larger body size of hatchling turtles may not evolve rapidly because the strength of selection was moderate in magnitude and the heritability was relatively low. These results emphasize the need for more detailed ecological investigations of the early life history of these organisms. Furthermore, this study highlights the utility of experimental manipulations of phenotypic variation for evaluating the potential impact of natural selection on life history evolution.

AB We explored the effect of post-fire microsites on seed and seedling distribution and hence their potential role in community restoration. A summer wildfire and control burn in a sclerophyll shrubland in mediterranean Australia produced mosaics of physically and chemically contrasting microsites of litter and sand. Most seeds (>75%) of all species released from the burnt canopies fell, or were redispersed by wind, into the litter patches after both fires. Data on microsite characteristics and wind exposure (fire intensity), height of fruits, time of release, and seed properties were required to interpret relative distribution between the litter and sand patches.
   Seeds remained equally viable (up to 100%) over summer-autumn in the litter and sand and had equally high rates and levels (up to 100%) of subsequent winter germination. However, seedlings were 2-3 times less likely to survive in the litter and survivors were 35% smaller than those in the sand by the end of the first summer. Banksia hookeriana was particularly vulnerable to microsite properties, whereas the needle-leaved Hakea polyanthema showed only minor responses. Pre-summer thinning of seedlings in the litter increased survival of the remainder by 2 times and size of the survivors by 31%.
   The fire-sensitive, small-seeded B. hookeriana had 17 times more seeds in the backburn litter than the resprouting, larger-seeded B. attenuata, which more than compensated for its 3 times greater seedling mortality levels over the dry summer. Recruitment of species prone to density-dependent mortality in the litter was enhanced by the retention of some seeds in the sand where competition for water was minimal, as indicated by the 2.2 times greater stomal conductance of their seedlings in early summer.

AB Four California annual grassland species were used to examine the hypothesis that different plant species have equivalent competitive effects. We investigated the effects of the annuals on soil water availability and the growth responses of blue oak (Quercus douglasii Hook & Am.) to neighbor-induced water depletion. Neighborhoods of annuals were composed of species from the California annual grassland with differing phenology and morphology that were hypothesized to show non-equivalent competitive effects on both a per-individual- and a per-unit-tissue basis.
   Three introduced species of winter annuals were sown at each of three densities (10, 30, or 100 seeds/dm2) around a single oak acorn. The grass Bromus diandrus Roth. and the forb Erodium botrys Cav. flower in early spring, while the grass B. mollis L. flowers slightly later. A native summer annual forb, Hemizonia luzulaefolia DC., was sown at only the intermediate density. Plants were grown outdoors in 15 cm diameter x 1 m deep tubes filled with soil from an oak woodland site.
   Identity and density of annual species had independent and interactive effects on the water resource level. Soil water potential was negatively density-dependent, remaining highest when oaks were grown without competitors. At the intermediate density soil water potentials decreased in the following order: B. mollis (slowest), B. diandrus, E. botrys, and H. luzulaefolia (most rapid). This order followed the pattern of root length developed in the neighborhoods, which was species- and density-dependent. The relationship between sowing density and neighborhood dry mass also differed among the annual species.
   Correlations between root length and soil water potential were stronger for the forbs than for the grasses. A given root length of the summer annual, H. luzulaefolia, depleted soil water to a greater extent than did the same root length of any other species. Oak seedling growth, gas exchange rates, and survivorship were negatively related to the rate and extent of soil water depletion. Additionally, the relationship between annual root length and oak seedling height or root length differed by neighborhood species. Thus, neighborhood species were non-equivalent in competitive effect on both a per-individual and a per-unit-root-length basis. Phenologically different species may represent different functional groups of competitors.

AB Methane (CH4) fluxes were measured by a static chamber technique from May to October 1991 at 19 wetland sites near Cochrane, northern Ontario, representative of the Clay Belt Midboreal region of central Canada. Seasonal average fluxes of CH4 from the peatlands ranged from 0.4 to 67.5 mg.m-2.d-1 (0.06-10.1 g.m-2.yr-1). Beaver ponds showed the highest fluxes of CH4, from both the open water section (seasonal average 290 mg.m-2.d-1, 44 g.m-2.yr-1) and the adjacent marsh areas where the water table rose close to or above the soil surface (91-350 mg.m-2.d-1, 13-53 g.m-2.yr-1).
   Seasonal mean water table position, particularly at the microtopographic scale of hummock and hollow, explained most of the variability in CH4 emission among wetlands (r2 = 0.74). Trophic status, such as pore-water Ca, Mg, and pH had little correlation with CH4 emissions. Broad-scale peatland classifications that do not account for hydrological differences at the microtopographic level are inadequate for predicting CH4 flux in boreal wetlands, particularly in forested ecosystems where conifer swamps are diverse and comprise the major peatland class. Based on areal estimates of the different wetland types in the Clay Belt, we estimate an annual CH4 flux of 3.4 g.m-2.yr-1, generally lower than that used in extrapolations to continental- or global-scale methane budgets.

AB While density dependence has been well documented in many animal species, the effects of absolute size of habitat have not been thoroughly explored. This study investigates the effects of habitat size by examining the response of the distribution of several fitness correlates. I used populations of tadpoles of Bufo americanus and Rana clamitans in artificial ponds as a model system. The natural histories of these species suggested that they might respond differently to variation in habitat size, which was defined in terms of pond surface area and depth. These dimensions were factors in two completely crossed factorial experiments, one for each species. Ponds were of three areas: 529 cm2, 2116 cm2, and 8464 cm2 and three depths: 10 cm, 20 cm, and 40 cm. Tadpole populations were established at a single density (number per unit volume). The use of artificial ponds controlled variation in nutrient content, shape, and vegetation structure that may be confounded with pond size in nature.
   Increases in pond area resulted in Bufo populations that had lower survival, growth rates, and mass at metamorphosis. Populations in ponds of large area showed greater within-population variation in larval period, although the mean of this parameter was only weakly affected. Size distributions of individuals showed positive skewness in small-area ponds. Increasing depth led to lower survival but greater mass at metamorphosis. In experiments with Rana, increased area and depth both led to lower survival but greater growth by survivors. There were statistically significant interactions between area and depth in their effects on early Bufo growth and on Rana survival. The fitness of Bufo showed a significant positive relationship with increasing surface-area-to-volume ratio while Rana showed a mixed response.
   The results suggest that competition among Bufo tadpoles intensifies with habitat size under conditions of constant initial density by volume because of a decreasing ratio of edge to interior habitat. The form of competition appears to shift towards stronger interference competition in smaller habitats. Individuals may compensate for early, negative effects of habitat size. The variability of the several fitness correlates, while different among populations, showed no consistent pattern with population size. Theory based on assumptions of equal levels of variation in fitness in large and small populations may not be widely applicable to populations in nature. Evidence of changes in competition and fitness distributions should be sought in other systems characterized by variation in habitat size.

AB Research seeking to explain intraspecific variations in plant phenolics has focused on two general paradigms, the resource availability (carbon/nutrient balance) and induced-defense models. We experimentally tested both hypotheses to explain changes in phlorotannin concentrations in the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus. Fucus was collected monthly from two estuarine sites (Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA) differing in nitrogen availability, and analyzed for polyphenolic levels and tissue-nitrogen concentrations. In situ nutrient enrichment experiments were conducted to measure changes in polyphenolic levels related to N availability. Simulated grazing experiments examined the possibility of induced increases in polyphenolic concentrations in Fucus vesiculosus. Paired choice experiments conducted in the laboratory examined feeding selectivity by the snail Littorina littorea for either Fucus population.
   Field measurements and experiments revealed temporal and site-related changes in tissue constituents. Polyphenolic concentrations were consistently, sometimes two times, higher in Fucus vesiculosus from the low-N site compared with algae from the high-N site; tissue-N content was higher in the population from the high-N site. For both populations, tissue N was inversely correlated with polyphenolic concentrations. Only Fucus from the low-N site showed a significant reduction in polyphenolic concentrations under experimental enrichment. Regression analysis revealed a significant inverse relationship (R2 = 0.71) between phenolic concentrations and growth rates for Fucus at the high-N, but not the low-N site. This suggests a growth cost associated with phlorotannin production for this phenolic-poor population due, perhaps, to C-limited growth. Phlorotannin concentrations increased significantly in clipped Fucus at the low-N site in two of three simulated grazing experiments, indicating an inducible response. We did not find a significant inducible response for the high-N, phenolic-poor population, and our choice experiments revealed a clear preference for this population by Littorina littorea. Our results offer support for both the induced-defense and carbon/nutrient balance hypotheses as explanation for variations in phlorotannin concentrations in Fucus vesiculosus. We suggest that within-species variation in polyphenolics is due to a complex interaction of environmental (nutrient availability, irradiance levels) and defense-related (grazing activity) factors.

AB Protandry, here defined as the earlier emergence of males, is a common feature in life histories and could be the result of sexual selection on males to maximize matings, or alternatively an incidental by-product of other selection pressures on the sexes. If protandry is selected for per se, theory predicts that it should be associated with seasonal environments where there is little overlap between generations. The degree of protandry should be insensitive to environmental conditions. Moreover, on the assumption that males and females grow at the same rate as larvae, a trade-off between development time and size is expected to result in a strong association between protandry and female-biased sexual size dimorphism. These predictions were tested by a combination of comparative and experimental studies on five populations of the speckled wood butterfly, Pararge aegeria, from central and south Sweden, England, Spain, and the island of Madeira. Protandry was associated with seasonal environments, as it was only exhibited in the three northernmost populations. Protandry in these populations remained largely constant in a variety of temperatures, both under direct development, when protandry results from a sex difference in development time through the egg, larval, and pupal stages, and under diapause development, when it results from a sex difference in pupal development time only. These results indicate that protandry is selected for per se through sexual selection in seasonal environments. Similar female-biased size dimorphism occurred in protandrous and non-protandrous populations alike, and hence sexual size dimorphism in P. aegeria is not a result of selection for protandry, nor the causal factor behind protandry. Protandry and sexual size dimorphism appear to be largely decoupled traits in the life history evolution of P. aegeria. This is achieved by means of variation in pupal developmental time and variation in the relative growth rates of the sexes. Variation in growth rates is likely to be a general phenomenon and may make possible independent optimization of size and development time (age at sexual maturity), and accordingly influence expected patterns of size-related trade-offs.

AB We tested the hypothesis of optimal winter fat storage in birds. The hypothesis predicts that when the survivorship benefits (fasting capacity) but not the survivorship costs (higher cost of flight, lowered agility, increased exposure to predators) of fat are eliminated by predictable resources (e.g., tree- and shrub-borne food), species will be leaner than species exploiting unpredictable resources (e.g., ground-borne food subject to sudden covering by snow). The predicted pattern was found in an earlier study of avian communities in central North America, where snowfall is frequent.
   Here we tested the predictions of the hypothesis that (1) when ground- and tree-feeding guilds are compared between geographic regions of harsh and mild winter climate, only ground-feeders will have relatively high fat reserves, resulting in a significant guild x climate interaction term in a two-way analysis of variance, and (2) ground- and tree-foraging guilds will both show low fat reserves in a mild winter environment. To test these predictions, visible subcutaneous fat class was measured in both guilds in Wisconsin and Michigan (harsh winter environments) and southwestern British Columbia, northwestern Washington, and Tennessee (mild winter environments). Both predictions were supported. We suggest that small birds wintering in North America approach local optima in energy storage strategy and winter survivorship. The energy storage strategy thus appears to be a major life-history trait in the nonbreeding period.
   The trade-off between the costs and benefits of winter fat has two potential implications for understanding population limitation. First, trade-offs that reduce reserves can lead to lower survival in severe winter weather than would occur at maximum fat levels. Second, our study suggests that individual birds are sensitive to, and can control, both predation and starvation risks. Recent theory of population limitation indicates that as food abundance declines, birds feed to avoid starvation, but at the expense of increased mortality from predation. Together these studies suggest that populations are limited by interacting (predation, food supply) instead of single (food supply) factors. Study of trade-offs used by individuals to maximize survival can provide unique perspectives on population limitation.

AB In this study, I describe the causes of persistent small-scale zonation in a terrestrial arthropod community. In central Oklahoma, two species of predaceous, pit-building ant lion larvae (Myrmeleon immaculatus and M. crudelis) coexist in a narrow, high-density (> 50 animals/m2) zone at the base of sandstone cliffs, where they are sheltered from rain and afternoon sun. Although larval movement is frequent and abundance within the zone varies seasonally, ant lions are rarely found > 2 m from the cliff base.
   I used field experiments and observations to test four hypotheses that could explain the maintenance of the ant lion zone: (1) zonation because of habitat availability; (2) zonation because of food availability; (3) zonation because of increased surface temperatures in exposed microhabitats; (4) zonation because of increased soil moisture and disturbance in exposed microhabitats.
   Ant lions are probably not limited to the cliffbase by the presence of rocks or vegetation, because there was no correlation between ant lion density and available habitat. The availability of prey also does not appear to limit ant lion distribution: ant abundance in pitfall traps was significantly higher outside the ant lion zone than within.
   Outside the ant lion zone, soil surface temperatures reach lethal levels in the afternoon sun. However, third-instar larvae of M. immaculatus transplanted in dry, sifted soil suffered little mortality over a 4-d period. Larvae transplanted into exposed sites gained significantly more mass than larvae transplanted into the ant lion zone, probably because of differences in food availability.
   Small-scale manipulations within the ant lion zone revealed that ant lion numbers decreased significantly over a 5-d period in response to both moisture (misting) and disturbance (pit-filling). In a recolonization experiment, the recovery time of patches exposed to a single ''rainfall'' treatment was extremely long: defaunated ''rainfall'' patches did not achieve the pit densities of defaunated control patches until after 84 d.
   Rainfall limits ant lion distribution through an interaction with temperature. Transplant experiments on natural substrata revealed the nature of this interaction. Within the ant lion zone, the soil remains dry and ant lion larvae bury themselves more rapidly in the sun than in the shade. Outside the ant lion zone, rainfall leads to the formation of a persistent soil crust. Larvae are unable to penetrate this crust, and they succumb to high temperatures in the sun.
   Because both species of ant lions are restricted to a narrow spatial zone, the probability of interspecific and intraspecific interactions (including competition, predation, and cannibalism) is increased. Such interactions may affect the density of both species within the ant lion zone. The abundances of M. crudelis and M. immaculatus were negatively correlated in quadrats from the center of the ant lion zone. Across the ant lion zone, the relative abundance of the two species also differed significantly, although the differences were not consistent among sites. Because of overriding abiotic constraints, neither species can achieve an ideal free distribution with respect to food resources.
   High-density predator aggregations may also affect prey community structure. Arthropod abundance was low within the ant lion zone, perhaps because of direct predation by ant lions or predator avoidance behavior by prey. Although the ant lion zone is caused by the interaction of abiotic factors, high-density predator aggregations have important biotic consequences for the population dynamics of the predators and the spatial distribution of their prey.

AB Many plants employ induced defenses that are activated after attack rather than constitutive defenses that are always present. Current theory predicts that one benefit of induced defenses is to optimize the plant's allocation to defense, growth, and reproduction. According to this reasoning induced defenses are expected under the following conditions: (1) Attack is unpredictable and not fatal. (2) Defense is costly; when herbivores are not present, the plant can save resources by not being defended and use them for growth and reproduction. (3) When herbivores are present, activation of the defense increases plant growth and reproduction.
   This study tested the allocation hypothesis by examining the effects of early-season damage to a desert shrub, Gossypium thurberi, in environments that either included or did not include its most abundant herbivore, Bucculatrix thurberiella. A companion paper demonstrated that induction occurred. Plants damaged early in the season supported fewer miners than controls that were not previously induced. If there was a benefit of induced resistance, I expected that survival, growth, and seed production would be greater for plants that had been induced experimentally by caterpillars early in the season compared to those that had not. I found no evidence that plants benefited by responding to damage early in the season, despite reductions in the populations of herbivores on damaged plants. If there were costs of induced resistance, I predicted that survival, growth, and seed production would be lower for induced plants than for controls when herbivores were excluded from both treatments. I found no evidence that induced resistance cost the plant anything in terms of survival, growth, or seed production. Finally, to determine if plant crowding was costly and if crowding interacted with induced resistance, survival, growth, and seed production were compared for plants that had no neighbors within 50 cm vs. those experiencing endemic densities of neighbors. Plants that experienced reduced density grew more and produced twice as many seeds as controls that experienced endemic densities of neighbors. No interactions between damage and plant density were observed.
   There are many different ways to interpret these negative results. I measured only a subset of the plant's lifetime fitness and the statistical power of my tests may have been insufficient. My experiment to test the benefits of induced resistance was much weaker than my tests of the costs of damage and of crowding. Herbivory may be unimportant in this system, although indirect evidence suggests otherwise.
   This and other empirical results suggest that the cost-benefit model may not be appropriate to explain the advantages of induced resistance over constitutive resistance. I discuss three alternative hypotheses to explain the existence of induced resistance.

AB Because the biochemical content of primary producers varies with their growth rate, herbivores feeding on foods of high growth rate have different diets than herbivores feeding on foods of low growth rate. Herbivores' food quality is thus related to their resource's growth rate. Here, the growth in body mass of individuals of the herbivore Daphnia obtusa was measured for a variety of foods, which consisted of the chlorophyte Scenedesmus acutus cultured under a suite of N- and P-limited growth rates. Food quantity (measured as carbon) was held constant at 0.5 mg/L. In general, low growth rate algae were poorer in quality than high growth rate algae. The logarithm of Daphnia mass was well predicted by the logarithm of algal growth rate. Algal growth rates at < 50% of resource saturation demonstrated marked reductions in quality. Animals feeding on low growth rate foods, and which themselves tended to grow slowly, nevertheless accumulated lipid to a higher degree than faster growing animals.
   A biochemical analysis of elemental (C, H, N, and P) and biochemical (protein, carbohydrate, and ash) content (all as percentage of total dry mass) suggested the nutritional basis for these differences in food quality. Phosphorus content was especially well correlated with food quality. Daphnia mass was explained with an r2 of 0.97 by a regression model with P, C, and H content. Algal foods of > 1% P were high in quality, while foods lower than this exhibited reduced quality. These results are consistent with P limitation of Daphnia growth when feeding on foods of low P content.

AB Type II functional responses are frequently observed in herbivores feeding in Patches where plants are concentrated in space. We tested a mechanistic model of regulation of intake rate of herbivores foraging in food-concentrated patches (Laca and Demment 1992, Spalinger and Hobbs 1992) that accounts for asymptotic, Type II responses. The model is based on the hypothesis that competition between cropping and chewing regulates instantaneous intake rate in response to changes in the size of bites obtained by the forager. We tested this hypothesis and examined the ability of our model to account for observations of intake rate of 12 species of mammalian herbivores ranging in body mass over 4 orders of magnitude.
   We measured short-term intake rates of mammalian herbivores feeding in hand-assembled patches of plants. We varied bite size by changing plant height and density in patches offered to herbivores, and observed dry matter intake rates in response to this variation. Averaged across species, our model accounted for 77% of the variance in food intake rate (P < .001 for all species). Predictions of maximum intake rate closely resembled observations of processing capacity, demonstrating that processing rather than cropping sets an upper limit on short-term intake. Tests of model mechanisms provided strong support for the hypothesis that competition between cropping and chewing is responsible for the Type II functional response seen in herbivores feeding in food-concentrated patches. The model was able to consistently predict intake rates observed in 16 previous studies. These results indicate that plant characteristics regulating bite size (e.g., leaf size and geometry, spinescence) frequently control instantaneous rates of food intake by mammalian herbivores.

AB While much is known about control of production of NO and N2O by nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria at the cellular level, application of this knowledge to field studies has not yielded unifying concepts that are widely applicable and that foster understanding of global sources of these atmospheric trace gases. We applied a simple conceptual model to the investigation of sources of NO and N2O and the environmental factors affecting fluxes in a drought-deciduous forest of Mexico.
   Fluxes of NO and N2O were higher in the wet season than the dry season, but addition of water to dry soil caused large pulses of CO2, NO, and N2O emissions. Immediate increases of extractable soil NH4+ and high rates of gross N mineralization and gross nitrification also were observed following wetting of dry soil. Soil NO2- had accumulated during the dry season, and that NO2- plus the pulse of increased soil NH4+ were mostly consumed within 24 hours of wetting. This dynamic microbial processing of soil inorganic N coincided with the pulses of NO and N2O production following wetting of dry soil.
   Acetylene inhibition experiments indicated that NO production was dependent on nitrification, that nitrification was the dominant source of N2O when the soil was wetted at the end of the dry season, and that denitrification might be an important source of N2O during the wet season. Post-wetting soil moisture was correlated negatively with NO fluxes and positively with N2O fluxes. These results support a conceptual model in which N trace gas production is generally constrained by the rates of N mineralization and nitrification, while the specific ratios of NO and N2O fluxes and the contributions from nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria are controlled largely by soil moisture.

AB The effects of different types of predators may combine in complex ways to impact prey populations. In a series of microcosm experiments I empirically derived the functional response curves for two common types of stream predators, sculpins (Cottus bairdi) and stonefly larvae (Agnetina capitata), on two behaviorally and morphologically distinct types of mayfly prey (Baetis tricaudatus and Ephemerella subvaria). Data from these separate trials were combined using simple additive models to generate predicted combined functional responses for both types of predator.
   For both types of prey, actual combined functional response curves (both types of predators together in a treatment) differed significantly from predicted combined functional response for some ranges of prey densities. When Baetis was used as prey, significant departures from the predicted values occurred at moderate and high prey densities and were in a negative direction (interference between predators). When Ephemerella was the prey, significant departures occurred at low and moderate densities and were in a positive direction (facilitation between predators). Additive models for predicting combined predator effects cannot account for non-linearities in combined functional response introduced by non-trophic (behavioral) interactions that occur between fish and stoneflies, and between these predators and their prey. Other aquatic and terrestrial food webs contain similar linkages between vertebrate and invertebrate predators and their prey. Inclusion of behavioral interaction terms seems likely to be a necessary part of any general model predicting combined effects of predators on prey populations in these systems.

AB The colonization cycle hypothesis states that stream ecosystems would become depleted of insects if flying adults did not compensate for drifting immatures. Using long-term drift and benthic abundance data, we show that a Baetis mayfly nymph population moves downstream during development in the Kuparuk River in arctic Alaska. Baetis relative benthic abundance decreased from early to late season in an upstream unfertilized river section, while simultaneously increasing in the downstream fertilized section. Baetis nymphs drifted significantly more in the upstream unfertilized section, compared to the downstream fertilized section where food was more abundant. Approximately one-third to one-half of the nymph population drifted at least 2.1 km downstream during the arctic summer. A stable isotope tracer experiment and mathematical models show that about one-third to one-half of the adult Baetis population flew 1.6-1.9 km upstream from where they emerged.
   These results provide a quantitative test of the colonization cycle for the dominant grazer/collector in the Kuparuk River. Quantifying the colonization cycle is essential to understanding stream ecosystem function because offspring of downstream insects are needed for nutrient cycling and carbon processing upstream. Since downstream drift and upstream flight are important components in recovery of streams from disturbances, our results provide a quantitative method for predicting recolonization rates from downstream, essential to estimating recovery.

AB Approaches to determining the number of components to interpret from principal components analysis were compared. Heuristic procedures included: retaining components with eigenvalues (lambdas) > 1 (i.e., Kaiser-Guttman criterion); components with bootstrapped lambdas > 1 (bootstrapped Kaiser-Guttman); the scree plot; the broken-stick model; and components with lambdas totalling to a fixed amount of the total variance. Statistical approaches included: Bartlett's test of sphericity; Bartlett's test of homogeneity of the correlation matrix, Lawley's test of the second lambda; bootstrapped confidence limits on successive lambdas (i.e., significant differences between lambdas); and bootstrapped confidence limits on eigenvector coefficients (i.e., coefficients that differ significantly from zero). All methods were compared using simulated data matrices of uniform correlation structure, patterned matrices of varying correlation structure and data sets of lake morphometry, water chemistry, and benthic invertebrate abundance. The most consistent results were obtained from the broken-stick model and a combined measure using bootstrapped lambdas and associated eigenvector coefficients. The traditional and bootstrapped Kaiser-Guttman approaches overestimated the number of nontrivial dimensions as did the fixed-amount-of-variance model. The scree plot consistently estimated one dimension more than the number of simulated dimensions. Bartlett's test of sphericity showed inconsistent results. Both Bartlett's test of homogeneity of the correlation matrix and Lawley's test are limited to testing for only one and two dimensions, respectively.

AB Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) is quickly becoming the most widely used gradient analysis technique in ecology. The CCA algorithm is based upon Correspondence Analysis (CA), an indirect gradient analysis (ordination) technique. CA and a related ordination technique, Detrended Correspondence Analysis, have been criticized for a number of reasons. To test whether CCA suffers from the same defects, I simulated data sets with properties that usually cause problems for DCA. Results indicate that CCA performs quite well with skewed species distributions, with quantitative noise in species abundance data, with samples taken from unusual sampling designs, with highly intercorrelated environmental variables, and with situations where not all of the factors determining species composition are known. CCA is immune to most of the problems of DCA.

AB Communities subject to disturbance are apparently vulnerable to invasion in that they contain a large fraction of the introduced plant species persisting in any given area. Still, ecologists have a poor understanding of how details of the disturbance regime influence the success with which invaders spread through a community. In this paper, we report results from an experiment that investigates how the spatial distribution of bare ground influences the rate at which offspring of an introduced invader spread through a perennial ryegrass community. Artificially created gaps of three sizes were positioned along linear transects according to one of two spatial distributions. These six transects (one for each treatment combination) were positioned as spokes on a wheel and Senecio vulgaris was introduced into the center. After controlling for the total amount of gap area, we monitored the number ard position of Senecio vulgaris establishing for two subsequent generations. Our results showed that the rate of spread of Senecio vulgaris was sensitive to both the gap size and the gap distribution; plants moved a greater distance when the gaps were large and underdispersed. Simulation models confirm that this pattern follows from the way in which gaps sample from seed shadows. We derive an analytical expression to explain why the mean seed dispersal distance does not predict the spread of Senecio vulgaris adults, and show how rates of spatial spread will change under different spatial patterns of disturbance. Finally, a model of spatial point processes confirms that the distribution of gaps mediates the rate of weed spread in two dimensions as well.

AB We used electronic time depth recorders to examine diving patterns of Adelie Penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeding near Palmer Station, Antarctica. Most hunting dives consisted of a rapid descent to depth, a period of bottom time at near-constant depth, and a rapid ascent to the surface. Most hunting activity occurred in bouts of consecutive dives to similar depths. Adelies foraged at depths between 3 and 98 m, with a mean of 26 m. Descent and ascent rates averaged 1.2 and 1.1 m/s, respectively. Foraging was primarily diurnal, but there was relatively little circadian change in foraging depth. The birds' overall hunting effort (cumulative bottom time) was concentrated between 0500 and 2 100 at depths between 10 and 40 m. Bottom time decreased slightly with increasing depth but the correlation was weak. Dive duration was positively correlated with dive depth. Maximum dive duration was 160 s; most hunting dives lasted 60-90 s with a mean of 73 s. Post-dive surface intervals averaged almost-equal-to 50% of dive duration. Time use efficiency during dive bouts (bottom time/[dive duration + surface interval]) decreased with increasing dive depth. Estimates of oxygen stores and diving metabolic rates indicate that the aerobic dive limit of Adelies is 46-68 s and that most hunting dives require some anaerobic metabolism. Use of anaerobiosis engenders an energy penalty and probably affects both the behavior and energetics of foraging.

AB In full sunlight (photosynthetic photon flux density, 0.4-0.7 mum, PPFD), stomatal conductance to water vapor (g) and transpiration rates (E) are usually higher, and water use efficiency lower, in C3 than C4 species. In the C3 grass Bromus inermis, the difference in conductance between full sun (photosynthetic photon flux [PPFD] > 1500 mumol.M-2.s-1) and shade (PPFD almost-equal-to 400 mumol-m-2.s-1) was twice as large as in the C4 species Sorghastrum nutans (226.7 vs. 97.8 mmol.m-2.s-1, respectively). Similar differences were measured in four additional C3 and C4 grasses. Variability in PPFD incident on leaves is very common in grasslands, and stomata are known to respond relatively rapidly to fluctuations in this resource. This study evaluated the consequences of different responses in stomatal conductance between C3 and C4 grasses during periods of sunlight variability. Photosynthesis (A, measured as CO2 uptake) and g varied substantially in both B. inermis and S. nutans as PPFD fluctuated between sun and shade levels (4-10 min intervals). Time constants derived from first-order equations describing responses in g after abrupt changes in PPFD indicated that g approached steady-state levels more rapidly in S. nutans than in B. inermis. However, because of the greater magnitude of change in g between sun and shade PPFD in B. inermis, the absolute rate of change in g in this C3 grass was twice as rapid compared to S. nutans (25.7 vs. 12.4 mmol.m-2.s-1.min-1 for reductions in g, respectively). New steady-state levels in g were achieved in 12-13 min after a change in PPFD in S. nutans and 15-19 min in B. inermis.
   A statistically based two-state (sun/shade) simulation model was used to quantify costs in A and E of the nonsteady-state responses measured for both species as PPFD varied. Costs were calculated as the difference between model output of A or E based on field responses and model output based on hypothetical ps exchange responses in which A and g changed instantaneously. Results suggested that even though the absolute rate of change in g was greater in the C3 grass, costs in E during periods of short-term (2-6 min) variations in PPFD were as much as sixfold higher than in the C4 species. Lower cost in E in C4 species during periods of variable PPFD (due to inherently smaller alterations in g) is a previously unrecognized consequence of the C4 photosynthetic pathway. C4 species, and grasses in particular, often are most successful in high-PPFD, water-limited environments in which leaf-level variability in PPFD occurs daily from cloud cover and within-canopy shading. In these environments, stomatal responses that conserve water under nonsteady-state conditions may contribute significantly to the success of C4 species.

AB We have been able to clearly study the mechanisms and consequences of intraspecific competition, in contrast to most studies, because the cave beetle (Neaphaenops tellkampfi, Carabidae) has no competitors and only a single available prey item, cricket eggs (Hadenoecus subterraneus, Rhaphidophoridae), in our study area in Mammoth Cave National Park. The sexes do not differ in size or external morphology and we have never seen interference with copulating pairs and so the likelihood of competition for mates or female choice seems low or nonexistent compared to competition for food. Both in the field and laboratory we assessed: (1) foraging effort by numbers of holes dug; (2) potential foraging success by whether the holes were deep enough to reach a buried cricket egg; and (3) time since foraging success by abdominal distension and body mass. We assessed both exploitation competition, the indirect effect of beetles on each other via cricket egg prey, and interference competition, the direct effect of beetles on each other. To demonstrate exploitation competition we showed that (1) beetles in the field reduced the density of egg prey, (2) lowered egg density in the laboratory resulted in decreased per capita harvest rate, and (3) in the field reduced harvest rates resulted in reduced fecundity at times of year when cricket numbers, fecundity, and egg-laying were lowest and beetle densities were highest. To demonstrate interference competition we showed that beetles reduced each other's foraging effectiveness. In laboratory arenas per capita foraging effectiveness decreased when egg density was held at 10 and beetle density increased from 1, to 2, to 4 per arena. With increasing beetle density there were significant declines in holes dug per beetle, depths of holes, and eggs eaten per beetle. In addition beetles spent less time foraging. In the field interference competition, as assayed by decreasing hole depths, was significantly greater in areas of high beetle density than in areas with low beetle density. Fights for holes occurred only in areas of high beetle density. Preempting holes or stealing eggs could be advantageous since bioenergetic calculations showed that the cost of digging for eggs is as high as two-thirds of a beetle's energy budget. In the field in areas of high beetle density there was no defense of holes < 3 mm deep and defense of all holes > 7 mm deep. Beetles that had recently eaten eggs were found significantly more often under rocks and on the ceiling where we infer that chances of eggs being stolen are low.

AB The characteristic seed size of a plant species may reflect evolution toward an optimal compromise between size and number of seeds produced. The extent to which large seed size conveys an advantage to a seedling probably varies according to circumstances, and this may explain at least some of the great variation in seed size among species. Here we test whether large-seeded species are better able than small-seeded species to withstand defoliation at the seedling stage. We compared growth and survival of seedlings of 40 species of Australian angiosperms after removing 95% of their photosynthetic tissue shortly after emergence. We accounted for effects of phylogeny by selecting pairs of species that were ''phylogenetically independent contrasts.'' That is, the phylogenetic path connecting the two species of any pair was independent of the path connecting the two species of any other pair we used. We also selected the species so that the two members of each pair differed at least 10-fold in seed mass. Therefore, each pair provided an independent case for examining the consequences of evolutionary divergence in seed size. We found that the larger seeded species survived loss of photosynthetic tissue better than the smaller seeded species in 14 of the 16 pairs for which there was a significant difference in survival. The extent to which growth of survivors was reduced by loss of photosynthetic tissue also differed in 8 pairs, with the large-seeded species being less affected in 6 of these cases. We conclude that large seed size is generally associated with greater ability of seedlings to cope with loss of photosynthetic tissue. Consequently, large seed size may be favored in any circumstances in which seedlings are likely to experience carbon deficit early in development.

AB Stamens produce male gametophytes and expose them to the pollination process, so that stamen characteristics should reflect selection on male function. For animal-pollinated plants, restricting removal in favor of using all available pollinators should generally promote pollen dispersal, so that staminal characteristics should limit pollen removal by individual pollinators. Here we describe the influences of anther position on pollen removal from Pontederia cordata, a tristylous plant with anthers at three distinct positions: exserted from the flower (long-level anthers), at the mouth of the flaring tubular perianth (mid-level anthers), and near the perianth base (short-level anthers).
   To measure pollen removal, we presented unvisited flowers to freely foraging bees and counted the number of pollen grains left in flowers after 1-4 visits. The pollinators included two generalist bumble bees (Bombus impatiens and B. vagans: Apidae) and Melissodes apicata (Anthophoridae), a specialist with morphological and behavioral adaptations for collecting pollen from P. cordata. Analysis of pollen removal incorporated the effects of bee species, anther position, pollen size, flower length, and the number and cumulative duration of bee visits.
   Anther position and bee species significantly influenced pollen removal, although the differences between bee species were not related to pollinator specialization. Long-level anthers dehisced early, lost an average of 39% of their pollen during their first visit, and did not consistently contact small pollinators, such as M. apicata. Short-level anthers restricted pollen removal more (28% lost) than long-level anthers, but dehisced more slowly and were subject to unpredictable pollen removal. Mid-level anthers combine the advantages of more exserted and inserted positions without suffering the corresponding disadvantages as they restricted removal (24% lost), dehisced relatively early, and seemed to consistently contact all pollinators. The overall benefits of positioning anthers within the perianth mouth, the position occupied by mid-level anthers in P. cordata, may explain the prevalence of this morphology among bee-pollinated plants with flaring, tubular, monomorphic flowers.

AB The sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii is important in determining biogenic habitat structure on rocky reefs in New South Wales. Individual C. rodgersii, in common with other diadematids, are found in shelters during the day, from which they emerge to forage at night and maintain patches of barrens habitat. The effect of availability of shelter on the foraging behavior of C rodgersii, and on the abundance of benthic invertebrates and algae, was investigated by a field experiment. Physical heterogeneity in the form of large boulders were translocated between the barrens and Ecklonia forest habitats and arranged so as to either maximize or minimize shelter. The fauna and flora on translocated boulders became progressively similar to that found in the surrounding habitat. Most obvious of these changes were reductions in the density of foliose algae on boulders moved from Ecklonia forest to barrens and reductions in the density of limpets in the reverse translocation. C rodgersii recruited to all treatments irrespective of where the boulders came from, where they were moved to, and the amount of shelter provided. The availability of shelter was clearly a sufficient condition for the creation of areas of barrens habitat. The reliance on shelter by these sea urchins makes their local distribution and, therefore, that of the barrens habitat, more predictable than in other temperate regions.

AB The volume and sugar content of nectar produced by flowers can affect plant reproductive success by influencing pollinator foraging behavior. Because temporally varying environmental factors can affect nectar characters, the likelihood of pollinator-mediated selection for nectar characters may be reduced. To determine the constancy of interplant variation in floral nectar, I measured the volume and sugar concentration of nectar produced by plants in a population of Mirabilis multiflora within and between seasons. The means and relative ranking of nectar characters varied widely among plants. The means were remarkably constant within a season and across three successive flowering seasons. Variation among plants in sugar produced per flower was significantly correlated with the number of flowers produced (r = 0.29) and sugar concentration of nectar was significantly correlated with the date of peak flowering (r = -0.33). Ramets of clones had similar nectar volumes and total sugar produced, while genetically distinct near neighbors did not, suggesting a genetic component to nectar production. I conclude that plants of M. multiflora vary widely, and consistently through time, in their nectar characters and that this variation could affect pollinator behavior.

AB Variation in the intensities of above- and belowground competition is proposed to underlie changes in community structure associated with variable fertility and disturbance. Here we report measurements of light, soil nitrogen, and above- and belowground competition in vegetation that had received four combinations of fertilization and disturbance for 3 yr. Two levels of nitrogen addition (none and 17 g. m-2 . yr-1) and two of soil disturbance (none and annual tilling to remove all vegetation) were applied in a factorial design to 5 x 5 m plots (10 replicates) in a 31-yr-old field in southeastern Minnesota. During the 3rd yr of the experiment, community standing crop, light penetration, and soil ammonium and nitrate concentrations were measured every 3-4 wk. Fertilization significantly increased productivity and tilling significantly decreased community biomass at the start of the growing season, indicating that the experimental treatments created variation in stress and disturbance.
   Transplants of Schizachyrium scoparium, a native perennial grass, were grown with no neighbors, or with the roots of neighbors, or with all neighbors in each combination of fertility and disturbance in order to examine competition intensity. In both undisturbed and tilled plots, belowground competition was the dominant interaction in unfertilized plots, whereas both below- and aboveground competition controlled growth in fertilized plots. The intensity of aboveground competition was greatest in plots with the lowest light penetration and declined significantly with increasing light supply. Similarly, belowground competition was most intense in plots with the lowest nitrogen availability and decreased significantly with increasing nitrogen availability. The intensities of above- and belowground competition were significantly negatively correlated. The total (above- and belowground) intensity of competition did not vary with fertility, but was significantly reduced by disturbance. Similarly, the effect of neighbor mass on transplant growth was significantly reduced by disturbance.

AB The South African succulent Carpobrotus edulis has been invading native and non-native plant assemblages in California since its introduction in the early 1900s. This study was designed to determine mechanisms controlling invasion by this species into three different communities: coastal grassland, backdune, and coastal scrub. The communities differed in several factors that influenced invasion by Carpobrotus: soil disturbance, herbivory, and identity of competitors. Disturbance of the soil was required for establishment of Carpobrotus at the grassland site. Soil disturbance did not promote Carpobrotus establishment in the coastal scrub or backdune. Establishment in these sites was restricted by herbivory. The influence of neighboring vegetation on Carpobrotus establishment was site dependent. At the grassland site, Carpobrotus seedling survival was reduced by grasses, and the only surviving seedlings were on gopher mounds. Growth of larger Carpobrotus plants, however, was unaffected by grasses. Proximity to shrubs, the dominant plant type at the backdune and coastal scrub sites, did not affect Carpobrotus seedling survival. It did, however, decrease both root and shoot biomass of seedlings and cuttings.
   Invasion is expected to occur most rapidly at the grassland site. Although germination and early survival there depend on the occurrence of rodent disturbances, these occur frequently, and seedling recruitment in the grassland was observed during this study. Once established, clonal growth is great and is not affected by herbivory or competition. In contrast, at the coastal scrub site, intense herbivory prevented successful establishment during this study. Cage experiments suggested that herbivory counteracted the high growth potential of Carpobrotus at this site. At the dune site, even caged plants showed very poor growth. Thus, although seedling recruitment does occur there, invasion is expected to be slow due to harsh physical conditions that limit both survival and growth. These findings demonstrate strong community differences in the factors governing invasability by Carpobrotus edulis.

AB Interspecific competitors often colonize communities at different times, but few studies have experimentally tested whether the strength of interspecific competition hinges on the order or temporal separation of species' arrivals. We added hatchlings of two sympatric anuran species (Hyla [= Pseudacris] crucifer and Bufo woodhousii) to artificial ponds on three different dates to manipulate the order and temporal separation of their arrival. Measurement of the growth and survival of each species in ponds where the second species arrived simultaneously (day 0), or after a delay of 7 or 14 d, indicated whether differences in the history of introductions affected interspecific competition. Other ponds contained H. crucifer alone, introduced on the same three dates, or B. woodhousii alone, introduced on the first or second date. These provided controls for seasonal differences in performance in the absence of competition from the other anuran species.
   Introductions of tadpoles at different times produced small differences in growth rates and larval periods when each anuran species occurred alone. In ponds containing both species, differences in the order and temporal separation of introductions had complex effects on the intensity of interspecific competition. When Bufo preceded Hyla, Hyla had prolonged larval periods and reduced mass and growth. When Hyla preceded Bufo, it was unaffected by Bufo. Hyla had no effects on Bufo, whether its introduction preceded or followed the introduction of Bufo.
   Asymmetric priority effects were not easily explained as a simple size-dependent competitive advantage of earlier arrivals. Early arrival increased the competitive impact of Bufo on Hyla, but failed to generate a competitive effect of Hyla on Bufo. Bufo tadpoles are more active than Hyla, and so may consume resources at higher rates that cannot be offset by a temporal advantage. Competition from Bufo was strongest when Hyla arrived 7 d later, suggesting that Hyla arriving 14 d after Bufo benefited from a longer period of reduced competition after Bufo metamorphosed from the ponds. The natural pattern, where Hyla breeds before or simultaneously with Bufo, permits Hyla to minimize competition from Bufo, while Bufo suffers no measurable cost from the size advantage obtained by competitively weaker Hyla tadpoles. Bufo may be prevented from breeding any earlier in the season by physiological constraints acting on eggs or breeding adults.

AB An 11-yr study of life history and demographic variation in the sagebrush lizard Sceloporus graciosus was carried out on two study areas (Rattlesnake Ridge and Ponderosa Flat) in the Kolob Mesa Section of Zion National Park, Utah. Two primary objectives of this mark-recapture study were to: (1) quantify variation in age structure, age and size at maturity, age-specific survivorship and fecundity, and individual growth rates, and (2) conduct a series of density reduction experiments designed to elucidate the effects of density on growth rates and survival of posthatchling lizards. In addition, we examined the relationships of variation in population density and deviation from long-term average precipitation and temperature to variation in individual growth, reproduction, and demography.
   At both sites the active season was almost-equal-to 160 d, extending from early April to mid-September. Reproduction occurred during a 50-d period between mid-May and early July. Mean clutch size was 3.7 eggs and most females produced their first clutch in the 2nd yr of life (their third active season) at an age of almost-equal-to 22-24 mo and a minimum snout-vent length of almost-equal-to 50 mm. Most mature females produced two clutches of eggs per year, and there was no statistically significant variation in either mean clutch size or body-size-adjusted clutch size among the 11 yr of study. Clutch size was significantly correlated with body size. Relative clutch mass averaged 0.247 and was not significantly correlated with body size. Since hatchlings first appeared in early to mid-August, their first growing season was almost-equal-to 2 mo long. There was no significant sexual dimorphism in growth rate or body size in either population.
   There was great variation in estimates of egg-yearling survival among years. Egg-yearling survival probability varied from 0.12 to 0.59 with a mean of 0.28. At Ponderosa Flat, the survival of yearling males (0.38) was significantly lower than that of yearling females (0.47). Survival of yearling males (0.45) and females (0.43) at Rattlesnake Ridge was not significantly different. There were no other significant differences in the survival of males and females (XBAR = 0.56 for both sexes) within any age class in any year of the study. However, the survival of yearlings was significantly lower than that of older lizards in both populations. Mean posthatchling survival over all years was 0.45, and there was significant heterogeneity in posthatchling survival among years. Average annual survival of immigrants (0.32) was significantly lower than that of residents (0.44).
   There was a significant negative linear relatonship between yearling body size in late June and total density of posthatchling lizards. A stepwise linear regression model revealed significant effects of both rainfall (and presumably resource availability) and population density on the growth of yearlings. This model explained 78% of the annual variation in yearling growth. Rank correlation analysis revealed that survivorship of hatchlings was negatively correlated with density of conspecific lizards. The negative correlation implies direct density dependence of hatchling mortality rates and is a potentially important mechanism of population regulation. Removals of almost all yearling and older age lizards from the study sites resulted in significant increases in growth rates of hatchlings in the year of the removal and yearlings during the following year.
   Four results from this study combine to suggest substantial resource limitation of S. graciosus on the Kolob Mesa. (1) Snout-vent lengths attained by yearling lizards were positively correlated with deviations from long-term mean rainfall values. (2) Body sizes attained by yearlings were greatest in the years following density reductions. (3) Body size attained by yearlings was negatively correlated with density of conspecifics. And (4), in a year in which a density reduction followed a warm, wet spring, more yearling females reached maturity than in all other years of the study combined.
   Finally, we compared data from the Kolob Mesa populations to those from other populations of S. graciosus.

AB Clutch predation is generally considered a selective force in nest site selection by ground-nesting birds. We examined characteristics of vegetation and cover around nest sites and inter-nest spacing for Willow Ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) to determine whether choice of nest location influenced probability of predation. Types of vegetation around successful and depredated nests and random points were similar. However, hens chose sites that had more lateral and overhead cover than that found at random points. Amount of cover was similar for successful and depredated nests. We suggest that hens choose cover to deter predation on themselves or to reduce energy costs of incubation. Inter-nest distances were larger and nests were located closer to the centroid of the territory than if nest sites had been selected at random. Hens that renested placed their nests farther from their first nests but not farther from neighboring nests than expected if they had located them at random. Probability of a clutch being preyed upon was not related to its distance from a clutch that had previously been depredated. We conclude that, for the breeding densities that we encountered, nests were spaced far enough apart to deter area-restricted search by predators. Predation may have been a factor causing over-dispersion of nests in the past, but current selection may be masked by other factors such as the hen's behavior or stochasticity.

AB Variation in food availability is likely to occur in the wild, and may affect resource allocation to various life history traits. Quantitative adult diet restriction had no effect on life-span or mean individual egg mass, but reduced fecundity in the butterfly Speyeria mormonia. The sum of fecundity plus unlaid oocytes remaining in the ovaries at death declined in direct proportion to the reduction in the adult diet. This indicates that oocytes were resorbed and resources re-allocated away from reproduction under resource stress, since the sum of laid and unlaid eggs for butterflies fed ad libitum did not differ from the number of oocytes present in the ovaries at eclosion. In this nectivorous species, then, life-span is conserved at the expense of reproduction under adult resource stress. Further, for butterflies fed ad libitum, the volume of honey-water imbibed declined with age for both sexes. Daily volume imbibed by females fed ad libitum was directly correlated with daily egg production and life-span, suggesting that factors as yet unexplored may be affecting both resource intake and life history traits when resources are available ad libitum.

AB A response surface design was used to help define the ''nutritional niche'' of the western spruce budworm, Choristoneura occidentalis. We evaluated how calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus interacted to influence budworm fitness on artificial diets containing five different levels of the minerals. We quantified survival rates for several life stages using a three-generation bioassay. Data from the bioassay were used to estimate population growth over three complete generations. Performance of the budworm was affected by Mg (linear response for F1 generation; 0.83-1.95 mg/g tested) and P (quadratic response for P1 [parental] and F1 generations; 2.74-4.95 mg/g tested) but was largely unaffected by Ca (0.50-6.81 mg/g tested). Overall, the results suggested budworm performance is best when Mg is at low concentrations and P is at moderate concentrations, and that very high levels of Mg and P are detrimental to the budworm. On average, host trees had too much Mg and too little P for optimal response by budworms. Interactions between Mg and P imply that balances or ratios of minerals are important in budworm nutritional ecology. However, detectable effects from Mg, P, and Ca in the diets diminished as the bioassay continued into the F2 generation, and, consequently, the estimated number of larvae alive at the beginning of the F2 and F3 generations showed no relationship to concentrations of the test minerals. This result probably reflected: (1) the loss of some design points in the second and third generations of the bioassay because larvae did not survive on diets that were markedly suboptimal and (2) increased variability in the population growth response as the experiment continued into the F2 and F3 generations.

AB A field study was conducted across a chronosequence of tallgrass prairie restorations to investigate the influence a plant's neighbor may have on its gross root morphology and association with mycorrhizal fungi. The root systems of a warm-season grass, Andropogon gerardii, and two perennial forbs, Coreopsis tripteris and Solidago altissima, were sampled by excavating soil blocks representing all pairwise inter- and intra-specific combinations of these species. With forb neighbors, Andropogon had higher percentages of its fibrous roots colonized by mycorrhizal fungi than with conspecific neighbors. Andropogon root morphology (as measured by average root radius, specific root length, and root branching) did not vary with neighbor growth form; however, Andropogon roots did become finer as restoration age and root densities increased. For Coreopsis and Solidago, colonization of fibrous roots did not vary with neighbor species, but both forbs had coarser roots with interspecific neighbors than with conspecifics. With interspecific neighbors, Coreopsis almost doubled the number of branches per centimetre of root observed in conspecific pairs. Although some of the variations in colonization and root morphology may be attributable specifically to neighbor root mass, others were related to the overall root mass of the target-neighbor pair. The observed variations in mycorrhizal colonization may be related to increased opportunities for colonization by the fungus that are due not only to higher root densities but also to some sort of interaction between the root systems of Andropogon and the forbs.

AB A series of experiments indicate that induced changes occur in the foliage of the annual morning glory Ipomoea purpurea when subjected to prior damage. These changes reduce the growth rate, consumption rate, and growth efficiency of larvae of the generalist lepidopteran Spodoptera eridania. They also alter the pattern of damage caused by specialist flea beetles, Chaetocnema confinis, and by generalist insect herbivores in the field. No effects of induction were detected on specialist tortoise beetles, Deloyala guttata and Metriona bicolor. Although total damage by both flea beetles and generalist insects did not differ between induced and noninduced plants, this result does not necessarily imply that the effects on these insects were nonadaptive. The observed effects of induced response are consistent with both ''diffuse'' and ''pairwise'' views of the selection imposed by herbivores on plant resistance. Finally, the existence of induced responses suggests that previous conclusions by Simms and Rausher that resistance to flea beetles and generalist insects is not costly in I. purpurea may be premature.

AB Plant competition is a process that occurs through the negative effects that individual plants have on resource availability to neighboring individuals. Therefore competition experiments need to examine how different species change resource availability to their neighbors, and how different species respond to these changes-allocationally, architecturally, and physiologically-through time. In a greenhouse study we used a model system of annuals to examine how canopies of species having differing morphologies differed in their architectures and light-interception abilities, and how different species performed when grown in these canopies. Abutilon theophrasti, Datura stramonium, and Polygonum pensylvanicum were grown as ''targets,'' surrounded by neighbors of a single species. Neighbors could be any one of the target species or Setaria faberii. Plants were grown in pots, with one target plant and four neighbor plants. Detailed measurements of neighbor canopy structure and target plant canopy architecture were made at five harvests.
   Species with different morphologies showed large differences in canopy structure, particularly when grass and forb species were compared. Setaria, a grass, had a more open canopy than the other species (all forbs), and was a consistently weak competitor. Overall, however, the relative effects of different neighbors on target biomass varied with target species. Target biomass was poorly correlated with neighbor biomass and leaf area, but was highly correlated with a measure of target light-interception ability that took into account both target leaf deployment and neighbor light interception. Despite clear differences among neighbor species in canopy structure and effect on light penetration, the results suggest no broad generalizations about the effects of different species as neighbors. Knowledge of morphological, physiological, and life history characteristics of both the target and neighbor species may be necessary to explain the results of their competition.

AB Current concepts of vegetation dynamics include that of the shifting landscape mosaic, but evidence for shifting mosaics in disturbed and undisturbed systems is primarily based on negative spatial relationships among adults and recruits, and not on measurements of actual shifts over time. We used aerial photographs to measure transition rates as evidence for mosaic shifts among grassland, coastal sage scrub, chaparral, and oak woodland communities in central coastal California between 1947 and 1989. In unburned plots without livestock, transition from grassland to coastal sage scrub was 0.69% per year, coastal sage scrub to oak woodland was 0.30% per year, and oak woodland to grassland was 0.08% per year. These transition rates, considered together, indicate that vegetation patterns may be dynamic on landscapes dominated by these communities. In burned plots without livestock, and in unburned plots where livestock were not excluded, transition rates were lower, except for the conversion of oak woodland to grassland. In burned plots, a high rate of transition of coastal sage scrub to grassland was measured. Markov chain models predicted much less directional change in community proportions in either grazed or burned conditions than in ungrazed, unburned conditions. Some transition rates varied with substrate and topographical position, indicating that fire, grazing, and the physical environment interacted to determine direction and rate of vegetation change. Variation in transition on different substrates suggests that only portions of the vegetation of these landscapes may be dynamic, with some patches in certain combinations of environment and disturbance that change rapidly, and other patches that remain static as edaphic or topographic climax communities.

AB Nutrient resorption from senescent leaves, by minimizing nutrient losses, could be just as important as uptake in determining nutrient balance, especially in low-nutrient environments. To examine the relative importance of phenotypic and genotypic factors in controlling nutrient resorption, we sampled several mediterranean trees and shrubs growing in serpentine and nonserpentine soils in northern California. Plants growing in serpentine soils had smaller, thicker leaves than those growing in richer sites and had lower N and P concentrations and pools on a unit-area basis. Pools of nutrients resorbed and nutrients left in litter in rich-site leaves were larger than pools in poor-site leaves, but N resorption efficiency (percent of total leaf N resorbed) was higher in less fertile sites (65 vs. 46%). Differences in efficiency may be due to the ratio of soluble/nonsoluble proteins, which is higher at low-N sites. Trends for phosphorus resorption efficiency were not significant (47 vs. 46% in poor and rich sites, respectively). There were no significant differences among species adapted to poor vs. rich soils, nor between needle vs. broad-leaved species. We conclude that a high nutrient resorption efficiency is a phenotypic response to low-nutrient environments.

AB Few studies have considered impacts of insect cone herbivores on bird and mammal seed consumers. Harvests of pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) cones by insects, birds, and mammals were negatively correlated both within and across sites. Birds and mammals significantly increased their cone harvest when the other group was experimentally prevented access to trees, and mammals harvested more cones when insects were removed from trees with an insecticide. These results suggest that stem- and cone-boring insects (primarily Dioryctria albovittella), birds (Clark's Nutcrackers, Pinyon Jays, and Scrub Jays), and mammals (cliff chipmunks and rock squirrels) compete for pinyon pine seeds. Additionally, insects affected the interaction between birds and mammals because the ratio of mammal to bird harvest increased up to 350-fold as insect cone consumption increased. Because insect-infested and uninfested pinyon pines are genetically different, these observations and experiments suggest that genetic interactions between plants and herbivores can affect the structure of a seed-consumer community.

AB The great variety of sexual systems possessed by flowering plants can be understood in terms of sex allocation theory, which assumes that individuals allocate resources to male vs. female reproductive structures so as to maximize total fitness. The relative shapes of the fitness pin curves for each sex can be used to predict and explain such allocation patterns. Several recent studies have attempted to measure the shapes of these gain curves. Typically, these studies have regressed estimates of male or female fitness against flower number for a set of plants of different size. Here I argue that this method is inappropriate, and that it can lead to incorrect conclusions about the true shapes of the pin curves if some third, causal factor, such as genotype, size, or environmental conditions, affects both allocation and the fitness returns from that allocation. I suggest that experimental manipulation of flower number is likely to be the most useful and easily interpretable technique for estimating the shapes of gain curves in plants.

AB Long-jawed spiders (Tetragnatha elongata) present a paradox to behavioral ecologists, because spiders in prey-rich habitats move to new web sites almost every night, while those in poor habitats rebuild their webs on precisely the same spot for many nights in a row. Caraco and Gillespie built a risk-sensitive foraging model to explain this paradox. Their model demonstrates that it may be advantageous to relocate more often when experiencing high prey capture rates (under certain regimes of spatiotemporal heterogeneity). However, their model had not been tested. I tested the Caraco-Gillespie model by conducting food addition experiments in the field with spiders in the poor habitat. The results do not support the model. A reexamination of the Caraco-Gillespie model suggests that it implicitly assumes unlikely larger scale patterns in prey availability.
   I present an alternative hypothesis to explain the paradox. Since conspecific density is higher in rich habitats, I propose that more intense conspecific interactions in rich habitats cause these spiders to move to new web sites more often. I conducted three replicates of a density reduction experiment in a rich habitat, and the results support the conspecific density hypothesis. The results of these experiments challenge a widely cited example of risk-sensitive foraging, and underline the importance of explicitly considering multiple scales of variation in ecology.

AB Canopy gaps in southern Appalachian mixed-Quercus forests were characterized to assess the impact of the 1985-1988 record drought on patterns of tree mortality in relation to topographic variables and changes in overstory composition. Using permanent transects, we sampled 68 canopy gaps within the Coweeta Basin. Among 1-5 yr old gaps, the most common gap type was the 1-yr-old single-tree snag, accounting for 49% of all gaps sampled; 65% of all gaps occurred within 2 yr of the drought peak. Gap area ranged from 40 to 850 m2, averaged 239 m2, with a median of 152 m2. Analysis of 1988 color infrared (IR) aerial imagery yielded a gap formation rate of 0.8 gaps . ha-1 . yr-1 in mixed-Quercus stands affecting 2.0% of the area in this forest type in 1988. The most frequent gap-forming species were Quercus coccinea, Q. rubra, and Q. velutina, respectively. Evidence suggests that moisture stress brought on by severe drought increases the susceptibility of Quercus species to the shoe-string fungus Armillaria mellea, which may result in significant shifts in canopy composition in these forests.

AB We investigated the effects of changing sapling availability on foraging selectivity and cutting rates by beavers in large experimental enclosures. As predicted by an energy-maximizing contingency model, the mean size of saplings cut by beavers increased with distance from the lodge and was positively correlated with sapling density. Species selectivity was also positively correlated with sapling density. Trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) was preferred to speckled alder (Alnus rugosa), and red maple (Acer rubrum) was the least preferred species. The functional responses of beavers presented with saplings of a single species and of similar size differed from those recorded in trials with a single species of saplings of variable sizes and from trials with three species of saplings of variable sizes. Size-selective foraging by beavers reduced the maximum rate of sapling cutting at high sapling densities relative to the single-size trials, but both treatments showed similar cutting rates at low sapling densities. Species-selective foraging by beavers reduced cutting rates at low sapling densities relative to the single-species trials, but both treatments showed similar cutting rates at high sapling densities. Species-selective foraging introduced a slight inflection in the functional response curve for preferred species, which could have a stabilizing effect on trophic interactions.

AB In a local convective storm, 85 trees were damaged in an 18.3 ha stand in the Pine Barrens region of southern New Jersey, USA. To determine what factors place individual trees at risk, damaged trees were measured and graded for degree of fire scarring and fungal rotting. Similar measurements were made on 280 undamaged individuals. Ages were determined in a subsample by coring. Only two of the seven species present suffered wind damage (Quercus prinus and Q. velutina). Damaged trees were more severely rotted than undamaged individuals both within and among species. Presence of fungal rot was strongly linked to scarring of the trunk by fire, which in turn was determined by date of recruitment relative to historical episodes of fire. Risk was not influenced by either tree size, proximity to existing gaps, taper of the stem, or interspecific differences in wood strength. Vulnerability to wind damage in this stand was determined by a summation of disturbance effects influencing tree recruitment and health over the previous 90 yr.

AB This study tested whether inbreeding avoidance could influence the frequency and timing of dispersal movements in a small microtine rodent, the meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus). Meadow voles released into experimental grassland plots with siblings were more likely to disperse from these plots than were voles released into similar plots with nonsiblings. Furthermore, voles that dispersed from sibling groups did so sooner than dispersing voles from nonsibling groups. Voles released with nonsiblings were recaptured within the plots for longer periods than were voles from sibling groups. Males from both groups remained within the plots for shorter times than did females, but the degree of this sex bias was greater for sibling groups. Thus, it appears that inbreeding avoidance can influence dispersal movements of the meadow vole and may be partially responsible for patterns of male-biased dispersal in at least some mammals.

AB Population dynamic consequences of habitat heterogeneity were investigated in a population of the desert annual Stipa capensis by measuring demographic responses of subpopulations inhabiting different habitats (slopes, depressions, and wadis) to natural and experimental changes in the amount of yearly rainfall.
   The results indicate that rainfall fluctuations affect the dynamics of the studied population by influencing both the percentage of germination and the number of seeds produced per germinated plant. However, the effect of changes in rainfall on both demographic parameters depends on habitat conditions, with slope subpopulations exhibiting the largest, and wadi subpopulations the smallest, effects. The fact that demographic responses to rainfall fluctuations are habitat dependent has two major implications. First, subpopulations inhabiting different habitats show considerable differences.in their year-to-year fluctuations in density. Secondly, since seed production per seedling is habitat dependent, the distribution of the seedling population among the various habitats is a major determinant of the total number of seeds produced by the population in a given year. The results further indicate that most of the seeds (75-99.9%, depending on rainfall conditions) are produced in the depressions and the wadis, which taken together account for only 10% of the total area. This finding indicates that the ecological conditions in these spatially restricted habitats are critical for the dynamics of the whole population. The overall results suggest that taking into account factors such as the number and types of habitats available, the relative area occupied by each habitat and the distribution of the individuals among the available habitats may be important in explaining observed patterns of population dynamics.

AB Although rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide are expected to directly affect forest ecosystems, little is known of how specific ecological interactions will be modified. This research evaluated the effects of enriched CO2 on the productivity and phytochemistry of forest trees and performance of associated insects. Our experimental system consisted of three tree species (quaking aspen [Populus tremuloides], red oak [Quercus rubra], sugar maple [Acer saccharum]) that span a range from fast to slow growing, and two species of leaf-feeding insects (gypsy moth [Lymantria dispar] and forest tent caterpillar [Malacosoma disstria]). Carbon-nutrient balance theory provided a framework for tests of three hypotheses; in response to enriched CO2: (1) relative increases in tree growth rates will be greatest for aspen and least for maple, (2) relative decreases in protein and increases in carbon-based compounds will be greatest for aspen and least for maple, and (3) relative reductions in performance will be greatest for insects fed aspen and least for insects fed maple. We grew 1-yr-old seedlings for 60 d under ambient (385 +/- 5 muL/L) or elevated (642 +/- 2 muL/L) CO2 regimes at the University of Wisconsin Biotron. After 50 d, we conducted feeding trials with penultimate-instar gypsy moth and forest tent caterpillars. After 60 d, a second set of trees was harvested and partitioned into root, stem, and leaf tissues. We subsequently analyzed leaf material for a variety of compounds known to affect performance of insect herbivores.
   In terms of actual dry-matter production, aspen responded the most to enriched CO2 atmospheres whereas maple responded the least. Proportional growth increases (relative to ambient plants), however, were highest for oak and least for maple. Effects of elevated CO2 on biomass allocation patterns differed among the three species; root-to-shoot ratios increased in aspen, decreased in oak, and did not change in maple. Enriched CO2 altered concentrations of primary and secondary metabolites in leaves, but the magnitude and direction of effects were species-specific. Aspen showed the largest change in storage carbon compounds (starch), whereas maple experienced the largest change in defensive carbon compounds (condensed and hydrolyzable tannins). Consumption rates of insects fed high-CO2 aspen increased dramatically, but growth rates declined. The two species of insects differed in response to oak and maple grown under enriched CO2. Gypsy moths grew better on high-CO2 Oak, whereas forest tent caterpillars were unaffected; tent caterpillars tended to grow less on high-CO2 maple, whereas gypsy moths were unaffected. Changes in insect performance parameters were related to changes in foliar chemistry. Responses of plants and insects agreed with some, but not all, of the predictions of carbon-nutrient balance theory.
   This study illustrates that tree productivity and chemistry, and the performance of associated insects, will change under CO2 atmospheres predicted for the next century. Changes in higher level ecological processes, such as community structure and nutrient cycling, are also implicated.

AB Amphibian larvae exhibit phenotypic plasticity in size at metamorphosis and duration of the larval period. I used Pseudacris crucifer tadpoles to test two models for predicting tadpole age and size at metamorphosis under changing environmental conditions. The Wilbur-Collins model states that metamorphosis is initiated as a function of a tadpole's size and relative growth rate, and predicts that changes in growth rate throughout the larval period affect age and size at metamorphosis. An alternative model, the fixed-rate model, states that age at metamorphosis is fixed early in larval life, and subsequent changes in growth rate will have no effect on the length of the larval period. My results confirm that food supplies affect both age and size at metamorphosis, but developmental rates became fixed at approximately Gosner (1960) stages 3 5-37. Neither model completely predicted these results. I suggest that the generally accepted Wilbur-Collins model is improved by incorporating a point of fixed developmental timing. Growth trajectories predicted from this modified model fit the results of this study better than trajectories based on either of the original models. The results of this study suggest a constraint that limits the simultaneous optimization of age and size at metamorphosis.

AB Using the free-feeding beetle Chrysomela confluens (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), we examined the hypothesis that naturally occurring hybrid zones between two cottonwood species are ''sinks'' or centers of insect abundance. Over a 3-yr period, we found that 94% of the C confluens population was restricted to a 13-km hybrid zone, which represents <3% of the cottonwood population.
   Of several potential mechanisms tested, expanded host phenology in the hybrid zone, relative to pure zones, best explained the distribution of C confluens which is dependent upon newly flushed leaves for optimal growth and reproduction. The hybrid zone is a superior beetle habitat because: (1) early leaf flush in the hybrid zone provides the first source of food for beetles in spring and (2) staggered leaf phenologies in the hybrid zone allow beetles to shift onto newly flushed Fremont trees as foliage of sympatric hybrid and narrowleaf trees declines in quality. This shift by ovipositing females can result in a 600% increase in fecundity relative to nonshifting females. Additionally, a 10-yr common garden experiment shows that there is a strong genetic component to the timing of leaf flush, which suggests a long-term stability of resources in the hybrid zone that beetles can rely on.
   For C confluens, the hybrid zone is a ''phenological sink'' that increases beetle fecundity and leads to chronically high herbivory year after year. Because movement from the hybrid zone reduces fecundity, emigration into adjacent pure zones is likely hindered. This hypothesis requires staggered phenologies between overlapping host species; it probably does not require hybridization between host species. Further, this hypothesis may in part explain frequent outbreaks of insects in nurseries and plantations. Thus, two distinct mechanisms have been identified that result in increased insect abundance in plant hybrid zones: ''phenological sinks'' resulting from staggered plant phenologies and ''hybrid sinks'' resulting from increased susceptibility of hybrids to insect attack. Such studies suggest that hybrid zones are important natural laboratories for the study of plant-herbivore interactions.

AB Early spring nitrogen cycling in temperate forests is dynamic and important to site fertility and retention of N in these ecosystems. In this study, we combined short-term (2 d) N-15-based measurements of plant uptake, microbial nitrification, denitrification, and immobilization with more conventional measurements of these processes over an 8-wk period from early March to early May within a temperate forest landscape unit in Michigan, USA. Measurements were made in two landscape positions, a summit position with a well-drained soil and a toe-slope position with a poorly drained soil. While soil mineral N levels showed little spatial and temporal variation over the 8-wk period, nitrification rates, microbial biomass (chloroform-labile) N, and denitrification were highly variable. The poorly drained soil consistently had high levels of nitrification and denitrification relative to the well-drained soil. Pools of microbial biomass N increased by a factor of 10 over the 8-wk period in both soils, but were relatively stable during April, when the N-15 experiment was conducted. Microbial biomass appeared to be the key regulator of the fate of added N-15. In the well-drained soil, the largest movement of N was into microbial biomass and total soil N. As a result of this strong immobilization, there was relatively little nitrification and denitrification of N-15 in the well-drained soil. In the poorly drained soil, there was no apparent movement of N-15 into microbial biomass. As a consequence, availability of (NH4+)-N-15 to nitrifiers was high, and rates of nitrification were very high. Accumulation of NO3- in the poorly drained soil, along with high soil moisture, fostered high denitrification N losses. The results suggest that N retention processes and the fate of either atmospherically or agriculturally derived N inputs will likely show strong temporal and spatial variation during the early spring period in temperate forest landscapes.

AB Many plants support both leaf- and sap-feeding insects, yet comparative studies of plant responses to different types of damage are rare. I compared the impacts of a leaf-chewing beetle (Trirhabda sp.), a xylem sap-feeding spittlebug (Philaenus spumarius), and a phloem sap-feeding aphid (Uroleucon caligatum) on growth of goldenrod (Solidago altissima). My goals were (1) to measure insect impacts on plant size as a function of herbivore loads, and (2) to determine the mechanisms by which insect feeding affects plant growth, using the techniques of plant growth analysis. Plants were grown outdoors in large pots, and insects were placed on them at a range of densities. A series of four whole-plant harvests was performed, with the final harvest occurring after 3 wk of insect feeding. Insect mass pin per plant was used as the basis for the comparison, since the insects differed greatly in size.
   Spittlebugs were the most damaging insect, beetles were intermediate, and no effects of aphid feeding were detected. After 3 wk of feeding, both spittlebugs and beetles reduced total leaf mass, total leaf area, and root mass, and the impact of the spittlebug was 5-6 times greater than that of the beetle. Spittlebug feeding also reduced the mass of the apical buds, stem mass, and the number of lateral stems, while beetle and aphid damage had no effect on these variables. Dry mass allocation to leaves, stems, and roots was generally not affected by insect feeding, resulting in smaller but proportionally similar plants by the end of the feeding period.
   Plant relative growth rates (dry mass increase per unit dry mass per day) were reduced by both spittlebugs and beetles but not aphids, and the impact of the spittlebug was more severe than that of the beetle. None of the insects affected net assimilation rates (dry mass increase per unit leaf area per day), indicating that the insects did not reduce plant growth by altering plant physiology. Instead, reductions in relative growth rates were explained by changes in plant morphology; feeding by both spittlebugs and beetles strongly reduced specific leaf area (leaf area/leaf mass). This reduction of leaf area relative to leaf mass was the mechanism by which both insects decreased plant relative growth rates. This result suggests an explanation for why simulated damage frequently fails to mimic damage by actual herbivores. When leaves are artificially removed by clipping there will be an immediate change in dry mass allocation patterns, but specific leaf area will not necessarily be affected.

AB We constructed an energetic model to determine the optimal focal point current velocity (i.e., microhabitat) for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and rosyside dace (Clinostomus funduloides) in Coweeta Creek, a fifth-order stream in North Carolina, USA. Energetic costs were evaluated by quantifying the metabolic expenditure associated with swimming at a given velocity. We estimated benefits by measuring potential energetic gains of feeding at a given velocity. This included estimates of the ability of the fish to capture prey at different current velocities as well as estimates of the frequency and the energy content of drifting prey at various velocities. We derived separate models for small (53-70 mm SL [standard length]) and medium (71-125 mm SL) trout, and medium (47-52 mm SL) and large (53-70 mm SL) dace for all seasons, deriving net energy gain as a function of current velocity.
   We predicted fishes would occupy velocities at which net energy gain was maximized. Predicted velocities were compared with those utilized by fishes inhabiting Coweeta Creek. Optimal velocities predicted by energetic models ranged from 7.7 to 22.1 cm/s, and closely matched actual velocity use (average deviation = 2.6 cm/s). Prey capture success appeared to be the most important component in the models. Consequently, we constructed models based solely upon aspects of capture success; the average deviation from velocity use with these models was only 1.8 cm/s. Thus, the ability of dace and trout to capture prey at varying velocities appears to be the dominant factor affecting microhabitat selection in these species.

AB This field experiment examined whether early-season damage to a wild, native shrub affected the survival and cumulative numbers over several generations of its most abundant herbivore, Bucculatrix thurberiella. The effects of reduced plant density on these herbivores and possible interactions between density and induced resistance were also considered.
   Half of the plants were damaged experimentally at the start of the season by feeding caterpillars; the other half served as controls. Half of the plants experienced experimentally reduced densities of neighbors, while the other half were surrounded by natural densitites. Early-season damage did not influence the initiation of new mines, although plants experiencing reduced density received significantly more mines than controls. Miners were less likely to survive on plants that had been damaged in 1989. This was also true in 1990 but only for those plants at reduced density.
   Effects on one stage in the life cycle of an insect need not translate into similar effects on the size of its population on a host plant. In this study, I was able to measure effects of resistance induction on the cumulative numbers of B. thurberiella because it completes many generations in each season and because a record of each individual is preserved at the end of the season. Damaged plants and those that had natural densities of neighbors had fewer cumulative numbers of mines than plants that had not been previously damaged and those with reduced densities of neighbors. Plant density had a greater effect than induced resistance on the cumulative number of mines produced over an entire season.

AB Increasing rates of relative sea-level rise (RSL) have been linked to coastal wetland losses along the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. While such losses have yet to be reported for New England tidal marshes, rapidly rising RSL may still be affecting these systems. Studies of the Wequetequock-Pawcatuck tidal marshes over four decades have documented dramatic changes in vegetation that appear to be related primarily to differential rates of marsh accretion and sea-level rise. Other environmental factors such as sediment supply and anthropogenic modifications of the system may be involved as well. When initially studied in 1947-1948 the high marsh supported a Juncus gerardi-Spartina patens belting pattern typical of many New England salt marshes. On most of the marsh complex the former Juncus belt has been replaced by forbs, primarily Triglochin maritima, while the former S. patens high marsh is now a complex of vegetation types-stunted Spartina alterniflora, Distichlis spicata, forbs, and relic stands of S. patens. These changes are documented by vegetation sampling that closely followed the 1947-1948 methods and by peat core analysis. Marsh elevations were determined by leveling, and the mean surface elevation of areas where the vegetation has changed is significantly lower than that of areas still supporting the earlier pattern (4.6 vs. 13.9 cm above mean tide level). The differences in surface elevation reflect differences in accretion of marsh peat. Calculations based on sandy overwash layers deposited during historically recorded storms as well as on experimentally placed marker horizons of known age indicate that stable areas have been accreting at the rate of local sea-level rise, 2.0-2.5 mm/yr at least since 1938; changed areas have accreted at about one half that rate. Lower surface elevations result in greater frequency and duration of tidal flooding, and thus in increased peat saturation, salinity, and sulfide concentrations, and in decreased redox potential, as directly measured over the growing season at both changed and stable sites. It is proposed that these edaphic changes have combined to favor establishment of a wetter, more open vegetation type dominated by two distinctive communities-stunted S. alterniflora and forbs. Changes documented on the Wequetequock-Pawcatuck system have been observed on other Long Island Sound marshes and may serve as a model for the potential effects of sea-level rise on New England tidal salt marshes.

AB Geographic variation in life history phenotypes between populations of a single species is often assumed to reflect genetic divergence caused by natural selection. The relative contribution of genetic and environmental sources of phenotypic variation is rarely determined, especially for vertebrates. However, distinguishing between phenotypic plasticity induced by proximate environmental variation and genetic divergence is fundamental to understanding the ecological and evolutionary significance of geographic variation. We used a reciprocal transplant experiment to uncover the relative importance of population-specific (genetic) and environmental sources of variation in individual growth rates between two populations of the fence lizard, Sceloporus undulatus. Our study revealed a population x environment interaction, consistent with a genotype x environment interaction that would result if differences between populations were genetically based. The growth rates of Nebraska lizards, normally twice that of New Jersey lizards, were reduced by half when the animals were transplanted to New Jersey. However, New Jersey lizards showed no increase in growth rates when transplanted to Nebraska. Comparisons of relative food availability (arthropod abundance) indicated that more food was available in New Jersey during the experiment. Estimates of potential activity day length using hollow copper models were from 2 to 2.5 h longer in Nebraska. This result suggests that the thermal biophysical environment may have reduced growth rates of Nebraska lizards transplanted to New Jersey, perhaps by reducing foraging time or by limiting physiological processes supporting growth. Our results are consistent with previous studies of S. undulatus that assumed genetic differences in life histories between populations and implicated the thermal biophysical environment as an ecological source of variation.

AB An increased probability of death is thought to be an inherent risk of dispersal. To examine this hypothesis, we monitored 381 radiomarked Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) over 6 yr to determine if their vulnerability to mortality increased during dispersal. Estimates of mortality were calculated for the two distinct phases of dispersal: transience, a period of extensive movement from one area to another, and colonization, the period when an animal attempts to become established in a new area. Among juveniles (nonresidents), approximately equal proportions of both sexes exhibited transience, and for similar lengths of time. The difference between juvenile male and female mortality estimates was not significant during either transience or colonization. From autumn to spring (natal dispersal), juvenile transient dispersers did not experience greater mortality than colonization dispersers. Among adults, transience was more common among females than males, yet no mortality was recorded among either sex of adult transient dispersers. Residents (adults) survived at a higher rate than juveniles in either transient or colonization dispersal. However, the cost (i.e., increased mortality) of transience was greater for juveniles than adults, suggesting comparisons between different phases of dispersal be made within similar age classes. It was concluded that Ruffed Grouse, both adults and juveniles, were not more vulnerable to mortality during transient dispersal than during colonization dispersal.

AB There is a strong positive correlation between the body sizes of dasyurid marsupials and the mean sizes of their invertebrate prey. This study tests three hypotheses proposed to explain this relationship, using 21 species of dasyurids (body mass range: 5-200 g) throughout continental Australia: (1) the maximum prey size that can be physically handled increases with dasyurid size due to the restricted gapes or forces of biting of smaller dasyurids; (2) the prey size that maximizes rate of energy intake varies with dasyurid size, with animals preferentially consuming the most profitable prey; and (3) prey sizes encountered during foraging vary with dasyurid size.
   Field observations of dasyurids were made at 20 study areas between January 1980 and February 1991. Most dasyurids were live-trapped, weighed, and sexed before being released at the trap site. We then tracked each animal and sampled potential prey in their foraging microhabitats. Dasyurid diets were examined using scat analysis. We measured rate of energy intake for captive dasyurids by offering different-sized cockroaches, measuring processing times, and calculating the energy content of cockroaches used.
   The first hypothesis was rejected. Both large and small dasyurids could grasp and pierce the largest prey offered in the laboratory, which were similar in size to the largest prey potentially available in the field. The second and third hypotheses were supported. Individuals of the smaller species maximized rates of energy gain in captivity by feeding preferentially on small prey, and their foraging trails in the field traversed microhabitats where mean potential prey size encountered was small (2-4 mm long). In contrast, larger dasyurids preferred large prey, obtained a greater rate of energy gain from them, and foraged in microhabitats where prey lengths averaged greater-than-or-equal-to 6 mm. There was a tendency for larger dasyurids to include progressively larger prey in their diets than were available, on average, along their foraging trails. This may reflect increasing selectivity for larger prey. However, it may also reflect a reduced susceptibility to predation or increased competitive ability for large dasyurids in productive microhabitats, and hence reflect a size-based advantage in encountering large prey. These results indicate that net energy yield and the use of microhabitats with different prey sizes are the most important determinants of the body size-prey size relationship in dasyurid marsupials.

AB Biostatistics channels ecologists into thinking primarily about the mean and variance of a probability distribution. But many problems of biological interest concern the extremes in a variable (e.g., highest temperature, largest force, longest drought, maximum lifespan) rather than its central tendency. Such extremes are not adequately addressed by standard biostatistics. In these cases an alternative approach-the statistics of extremes-can be of value.
   In the limit of a large number of measurements, the probability structure of extreme values conforms to a generalized distribution described by three parameters. In practice these parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood techniques. Using this estimate of the probability distribution of extreme values, one can predict the expected time between the imposition of extremes of a given magnitude (a return time) and can place confidence limits on this prediction.
   Using data regarding sea-surface temperature, wave-induced hydrodynamic forces, wind speeds, and human life-spans we show that accurate long-term predictions can al times be made from a surprisingly small number of measurements if appropriate care is taken in the application of the statistics. For example, accurate long-term prediction of sea-surface temperatures can be derived from short-term data that are anomalous in that they contain the effects of an extreme El Nino. In the cases of wave-induced forces and wind speeds, the probability distribution of extreme values is similar among years and diverse sites, indicating the possible existence of underlying unifying principles governing these phenomena. Limitations and possible misuse of the method are discussed.

AB The wave regeneration of forest trees is studied theoretically in model populations with a lattice structure, in which each lattice point corresponds to a stand containing a cohort of trees. It is assumed that the tree height at each site increases at a constant rate and that trees die in unit time if they are taller than their windward neighbors, with the height difference greater than a critical value. Starting from a random initial distribution, the spatial pattem becomes a saw-toothed shape, and moves at a constant rate downwind without changing its shape. In addition to this basic model, four models are also examined in which both the absolute height (or age) and the height difference between neighbors affect the tree mortality. Two rules (AND and OR rules) produce very irregular final patterns that are not saw toothed, but the other two (SUM and PRODUCT rules) often generate patterns that are close to saw toothed and more regular than those produced by the basic model. Both periodic boundary conditions and fixed height boundary conditions are examined. Two-dimensional models tend to produce more regular wave regenerating patterns than one-dimensional models.

AB Dispersal of young from their natal sites may be determined by their numbers or by availability of hunting sites, possible correlates of maternal hunting success and habitat selection. To test these alternatives, I observed the dispersal (ballooning on silken threads, moving on threads among vegetation, walking) of second-instar crab spiders Misumena vatia (Thomisidae) from nests and experimental releases that differed in number of spiderlings and proximity to hunting sites.
   The probability of ballooning by young crab spiders did not differ with size of clutch, individual size, or egg size; however, substrate had a strong effect. Spiderlings often ballooned within minutes from nests not near hunting sites, but usually remained much longer, up to several days, on excellent foraging substrates, typically goldenrod (Solidago spp.) flowers. Spiderlings released on both goldenrod in bud and asters (Aster sp.) in bud left quickly, often ballooning directly from them. Spiderlings from nests within 1 m of flowering goldenrods usually moved to these flowers, ones several metres away seldom moved to them. The choice of nest sites by the spiderlings' mothers thus indirectly affected the spiderlings' dispersal behavior. The lack of a significant correlation between maternal clutch size and spiderling dispersal means that dispersal does not change maternal fitness differences originally resulting from differential success in foraging (reported elsewhere).

AB Fungi are ubiquitous in soil and may affect seed survivorship directly by decomposition or pathogenesis, or indirectly through the effects of fungi on seed preference of granivores. We studied the role of fungi in the persistence of soil seeds in a shrub-steppe ecosystem using two experimental approaches. In the first, we examined survivorship of 900 seeds of five shrub-steppe species in nylon bags over a 10-mo period and determined viable seed losses to germination, decomposition, and pathogens. The proportion of seeds representing a viable seed bank decreased from 84.4% in the May pre-experimental conditions to 4.4% in March. Decomposition and attack by fungi were responsible for the greatest decrease from fall to winter (0% in August, 32.0% in November, 35.2% in March) while germination accounted for the greatest decrease from winter to spring (18.5% in August, 21.9% in November, 55.0% in March). Small seeds were more likely to be lost to decomposition and pathogens, whereas larger seeds had greater losses to germination.
   A subset of 80 experimental seeds was cultured for seed-infecting fungi. We found fungi in virtually all seeds; the most common fungal isolates were cosmopolitan soil fungi, such as species of Penicillium and Mucor. These species are known producers of extracellular enzymes and mycotoxins. Two sterile (nonfruiting) forms of fungi were also frequently isolated, as were two pathogenic species of Fusarium. In a second experiment we placed seeds in fungal cultures obtained from soil seeds and presented moldy seeds along with control seeds to a shrub-steppe granivore, the western harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex occidentalis). Ants harvested control seeds at nearly twice the rate of moldy seeds, suggesting that they avoided seeds infected with fungi. In this way, fungi may indirectly affect seed mortality due to predation by granivores, in addition to the direct effects fungi can have on seed survivorship. We suggest that fungi may play an important role in soil seed dynamics, but one that is poorly understood.

AB To determine whether an economically important moth species emigrates from the western Com Belt (Iowa and Missouri) to the gulf coastal areas of Louisiana and Texas each autumn, adult populations of Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel) males were monitored with traps baited with female sex pheromone, 16 July to 31 October 1986-1987. Concurrently, to estimate the potential for southward displacement of A. ipsilon, moths marked with a vital dye, Calco Red N-1700, were released at dusk 28 September and 2 October 1986, and 10 and 17 September 1987, from Ankeny, Iowa. Increased nightly moth-capture in Texas was positively related to numbers of nights with near-surface (100-300 m) northerly airflow (southward displacement of air) and decreased moth-capture in the western Corn Belt. Capture in Louisiana was also negatively correlated with capture of moths in the western Com Belt. The recapture in autumn 1986 of two moths in Missouri, 397 km and 460 km south of the release site, respectively, was possible because of nightly near-surface northerly airflow. Near-surface northerly airflow the night of and subsequent to 17 September 1987 was responsible for a marked moth being recaptured near Neota, Illinois, and another being recaptured near Brownsville, Texas, 276 km southeast and 1900 km southwest of the release site, respectively. We conclude that during late summer and autumn, A., ipsilon, and probably other insect species, respond to deteriorating environmental conditions by using certain weather systems with northerly (southward displacement) near-surface airflow to complete midcontinental migrations to more favorable areas.

AB Autocorrelation is a very general statistical property of ecological variables observed across geographic space; its most common forms are patches and gradients. Spatial autocorrelation, which comes either from the physical forcing of environmental variables or from community processes, presents a problem for statistical testing because autocorrelated data violate the assumption of independence of most standard statistical procedures. The paper discusses first how autocorrelation in ecological variables can be described and measured, with emphasis on mapping techniques. Then, proper statistical testing in the presence of autocorrelation is briefly discussed. Finally, ways are presented of explicitly introducing spatial structures into ecological models. Two approaches are proposed; in the raw-data approach, the spatial structure takes the form of a polynomial of the x and y geographic coordinates of the sampling stations; in the matrix approach, the spatial structure is introduced in the form of a geographic distance matrix among locations. These two approaches are compared in the concluding section. A table provides a list of computer programs available for spatial analysis.

AB Regeneration stage requirements can be determinants of adult plant distributions. We investigated this in two species-pairs: Protea obtusifolia and Leucadendron meridianum occurring on shallow soils overlying limestone, and P. susannae and L. coniferum on the adjacent, deep, weakly acidic, colluvial sands. We tested the hypothesis that abiotic regeneration stage requirements at the seed germination and/or seedling establishment stages determine adult distribution patterns. We excluded competitive effects in our experiments. We performed reciprocal seed transplants in the field, and monitored seedling emergence, establishment, and mortality over two summers. We determined iron, aluminum, calcium, and magnesium contents of 1-yr-old shoots, as well as soil temperature and moisture and midsummer water stress measurements of seedlings.
   There was higher seedling emergence of seed of all species on the limestone soils, negating the idea that seeds had germination requirements specific to their natural soil types. We suggest that this higher emergence is related to the higher moisture contents of the limestone soils. Seedlings of the limestone species performed better on their own soil type, with lower seedling mortality and overall increased survival (taking into account seed germination and seedling establishment) on their own soil type. Seedlings of the colluvial sands species, on the other hand, had slightly increased seedling mortality, and overall less survivorship, on their own soil type. Despite this, seedlings of these two species growing on the colluvial sands were larger than their counterparts on the limestone soils. There were both more and larger seedlings than those of P. obtusifolia and L. meridianum on the colluvial sands. Thus competitive exclusion is invoked to explain the sole persistence of the colluvial sands species on their native substrate.

AB In subarctic forests, birch (Betula) trees respond to severe (50-100%) manual defoliation by delayed inducible resistance (DIR). This plant response to defoliation is characterized by a decline in the nutritional quality of leaves for immature insects for several years after defoliation events, and concomitant changes in leaf chemistry that may be detrimental to insect nutrition, that is, a decline in leaf nitrogen and an increase in leaf phenols. Two explanations of delayed inducible resistance have been proposed. (1) The active defense response hypothesis claims that delayed inducible resistance is an active response to defoliation per se rather than merely a passive consequence of recovery from the stress of severe defoliation. (2) In contrast, the carbon-nutrient balance (CNB) hypothesis claims that delayed inducible resistance is caused by nutritional stress resulting from severe defoliation. We used two experiments to test these hypotheses. (1) In a three-way factorial field experiment we reared spear-marked black moth (Rheumaptera hastata) larvae on Alaska paper birch (B. resinifera) saplings that had experienced combinations of 100% manual defoliation and fertilization with N and P in previous years, and measured larval survival and pupal mass. In association with these measurements of larval performance, we assayed leaf condensed tannin levels and the concentrations of N and P in leaves, and correlated the results of these assays with larval performance. (2) In a laboratory experiment we tested the biological activity of condensed tannin and linalool, the major secondary metabolites of Alaska paper birch leaves, by treating leaves collected from previously undefoliated Alaska paper birch saplings with combinations of condensed tannin and linalool, and measuring the performance of spear-marked black moth larvae reared on these leaves. Our results supported predictions of the carbon-nutrient balance hypothesis. We found that fertilization with nitrogen, the nutrient limiting growth of Alaska paper birch in our study site, mitigated delayed inducible resistance, and that condensed tannin is likely to be the major chemical cause of delayed inducible resistance in Alaska paper birch. In our field experiment we also found that fertilization of Alaska paper birch with phosphorus, a nutrient that does not limit the growth of Alaska paper birch in our study site, affected levels of condensed tannin in leaves and the sapling's defoliation history influenced this effect. Thus, future studies of the effects of mineral nutrition on secondary metabolite production by woody plants and their responses to herbivory should consider nutrients that do not limit growth in addition to those that do limit growth.

AB The foraging behavior of four Parus species feeding at artificial feeders was studied, while controlling for ecological variables related to patch characteristics (food quality, food access, and escape distance to the nearest refuge). Hindlimb morphology (osteology and myology) was analyzed and compared with foraging postures at feeders. Using the Long-Tailed Tit as an appropriate outgroup for comparison, and considering functional changes associated with morphological changes, we demonstrated the existence of clear ecomorphological patterns relating foraging postures and hindlimb morphology in the four Parus species studied. The Blue Tit uses hanging postures preferably and its hindlimb morphology is modified for helping leg flexion. The Crested Tit more often stands and its hindlimb morphology is modified to aid leg extension. Great and Coal Tits are ecologically and morphologically intermediate between the two former species. Our results show morphology as a determinant of locomotion mode. Since foraging postures are tightly associated with substrate use, then morphology should be considered when studying pressures determining community organization. Our proposed integrative method for dealing with ecomorphology can be valuable in demonstrating the adaptiveness of morphological structures in phylogenetically and ecologically related species.

AB Larvae of the tortoise beetles Charidotella bicolor and Deloyala guttata carry shields formed from exuviae and feces over their bodies that are thought to provide protection from natural enemies. We investigated the effectiveness of shields as a defense against three groups of invertebrate predators (mandibulate, piercing/sucking, and chelicerate taxa) common in tortoise beetle habitats.
   Choice experiments, functional response studies, measurements of predator body size and mouthpart length, and a literature review indicated that predators with long piercing/sucking mouthparts (i.e., Heteroptera) were the most effective predators of tortoise beetles. For example, relatively large heteropterans with long, piercing/sucking mouthparts (e.g., Nabis americoferus and Podisus maculiventris) were not deterred by shields whereas small predators with short beaks (e.g., Geocoris punctipes) were. Likewise, coccinellid predators with short mandibles were deterred by the shield, while a carabid predator with long mandibles (Lebia fuscata) was effective at killing tortoise beetle larvae. No clear patterns of the effectiveness of shields against chelicerate predators were evident. Choice experiments also indicated that small tortoise beetle larvae were more susceptible to predator attack than were larger instars. Additionally, the effectiveness of the shields against different predators was quite similar between the two tortoise beetles.
   Field experiments indicated that predators are an important source of mortality for tortoise beetle larvae in natural settings, and high larval mortality is associated with elevated densities of predators with piercing/sucking mouthparts, such as heteropterans. Thus, shields provide some but not universal protection against the variety of predators present in tortoise beetle communities.

AB To examine behavioral mechanisms of fruit selection, American Robins (Turdus migratorius) were studied foraging on Crataegus monogyna fruits in western Oregon. Robins faced a hierarchical decision-making process of fruit selection: (1) in which shrub to feed (decisions among shrubs); (2) which fruits to pick (visual decisions among fruits); and (3) which fruits to swallow once picked (within-bill decisions). Field observations of natural and experimentally manipulated populations of C monogyna shrubs demonstrated that choices made by robins among shrubs were correlated with three plant traits (decision cues): fruit abundance, fruit size, and fruit pulpiness. These cues were themselves used hierarchically, so that when higher-ranking cues were held constant by manipulating shrubs, the next available cue became important. Once shrubs were selected, field and aviary work revealed that robins then made visual choices among fruits correlated with fruit size. However, no evidence was found to suggest that robins made within-bill decisions; once fruits were picked, additional discrimination did not occur. I suggest that a hierarchical process of fruit selection may have evolved to enable frugivores to cope with environmental uncertainty that is typical of fruiting systems. Such flexibility in foraging behavior may, in itself, promote variability within and among fruiting plants and therefore help to explain why so few general patterns have been identified in fruiting plant-fragivore relationships.

AB Studies of hatching asynchrony in altricial birds have used several methods to determine if a brood hatches synchronously or asynchronously. The most commonly used methods include making frequent nest visits during the time of hatching and using nestling mass or other measures of size on a given day to estimate nestling age or to describe the extent of the size hierarchy within broods. We made daily nest visits to determine if House Wren (Troglodytes aedon) broods hatched synchronously or asynchronously, and then compared classification of these broods based on discriminant function analysis with that based on mass differences of nestlings. The best misclassification rate based on discriminant function analysis was 17.5%, whereas the rates based on mass differences (23.1%) and estimates of nestling age (27.5%) were higher, but not significantly higher. The most frequent error occurring in discriminant function analysis was misclassifying asynchronous broods as synchronous broods, whereas the most frequent error based on mass differences of nestlings was misclassifying synchronous broods as asynchronous ones. Discriminant function analysis based on coefficient of variation of nestling mass and number of nestlings was about as effective (error rate = 17.5%) as was classification using individual masses. We recommend that investigators who wish to categorize broods objectively as synchronous or asynchronous based on nestling masses or other measures of size should use a discriminant function analysis.

AB Life history data for three unexploited populations of brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis, were used to test the predictions of life history theory that, relative to juveniles, (1) high adult survival favors low reproductive effort and delayed reproduction, and (2) increased juvenile growth rate favors high effort and early reproduction. Field data supported both predictions. The population having the highest adult-to-juvenile survival ratio expended the least effort, reproduced latest in life, and experienced the lowest survival cost of reproduction. Among populations a high juvenile-to-adult growth rate was associated with early reproduction, high reproductive effort, and high reproductive cost. Early reproduction was also associated with increased growth within populations.
   The adaptive significance of interpopulation variation in life history was assessed by comparing the fitness, r, of observed life histories with those of potentially alternative strategies. Empirically derived fitness functions supported the hypothesis that population differences in life history were adaptive. Observed combinations of age-specific survival and fecundity were those that maximized fitness. Within populations the fitness advantages associated with reproducing early in life favored reduced age at reproduction for the fastest-growing individuals. The results are consistent with the predictions of life history theory and demonstrate empirically how survival and growth rate can independently and interactively influence life history evolution.

AB Phosphorus fertilization of a pristine tundra river for four consecutive summers dramatically changed biological processes and populations at all trophic levels. At the primary producer level, both algal biomass and productivity increased and chlorophyll accumulated on the river bottom in the first two summers. Diatom community composition changed little in spite of large chlorophyll changes. However, an increase in grazing insects prevented chlorophyll buildup in the third and fourth summers.
   Some microbial processes were also stimulated by the increased photosynthesis caused by fertilization. Total respiration of the epilithon, acetate uptake, and decomposition of lignin monomers were all stimulated but only in light-grown epilithon. When epilithon was grown in the dark in the fertilized region of the river, there was no increased respiration. Also, phosphorus did not stimulate the decomposition of Carex litter.
   Although insects grew more rapidly in the fertilized section of the river, there were community interactions that kept total insect production from appreciable change. The four most abundant large insects did increase their growth rates in response to phosphorus addition and there were increases in populations of Baetis lapponicus and Brachycentrus americanus. These increases were offset by the decline in abundance of the dominant species, the black fly Prosimulium martini, perhaps caused by competition for space from Brachycentrus.
   Growth of both young-of-the-year and adult grayling (Thymallus arcticus) was strongly stimulated by phosphorus addition in years 3 and 4 (not tested in years 1 and 2). Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope tracers indicated that the measured increases in insect and fish growth were largely attributable to increases in the production of epilithic algae. Overall, the results indicate a strong ''bottom-up'' response of the riverine food web to additions of the limiting nutrient, phosphorus. The response was modified in later years, however, by a strong ''top-down'' feedback of insects grazing on epilithic algae and by competitive exclusion of black flies by caddisflies.

AB Although the growth of eelgrass (Zostera marina) is controlled by resources as well as higher order interactions with epiphytes and their herbivores, these constraints rarely are considered together. The ability to utilize both water column and sediment nutrient sources in a complex habitat may provide eelgrass with a partial release from nutrient competition with epiphytes that have more efficient uptake kinetics and can reduce eelgrass growth, particularly in eutrophic habitats. We investigated the relative effects of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the water column vs. the sediments, and herbivory by the common isopod Idotea resecata, on eelgrass growth and epiphyte biomass in an intertidal eelgrass bed in Padilla Bay, Washington. In the field, we fertilized the sediments and/or the water column with ammonium and measured eelgrass growth and epiphyte biomass. We also monitored epiphyte biomass and water column nutrient concentrations and censused isopod densities. Laboratory experiments focused on the effects of L resecata, fertilization of the water column and sediments, and depletion of sediment nutrients on eelgrass growth and epiphyte biomass. Most simply, we hypothesized that epiphytes would respond positively to increased water column nutrients as eelgrass would to increased sediment nutrients, and that herbivory on epiphytes could mitigate deleterious effects of epiphytes on eelgrass.
   We demonstrated that eelgrass growth is affected both by sediment nitrogen resources and the higher order effects of epiphytes and their control by Idotea resecata. During our field experiments, growth of eelgrass leaves tended to increase in response to sediment fertilization; this trend was significant in April 1988 but not in August 1987. At both times, leaf growth rates demonstrated a saturation-type response to sediment ammonium concentrations > 100 mumol/L, providing further support for nitrogen limitation of eelgrass growth over much of the range in ambient concentrations (30-137 mumol/L) in the sediment porewaters. Together, sediment ammonium concentrations and epiphyte biomass explained a significant portion (71%) of the variance in eelgrass leaf growth in August 1987.
   Consideration of sediment nitrogen, epiphytes, or herbivores alone is unlikely to yield a predictable understanding of the control of eelgrass primary productivity in nature, particularly given the complexity of the eelgrass habitat with respect to its dual nutrient sources. For example, epiphyte biomass was predicted by our laboratory experiments and other data to be nitrogen limited in Padilla Bay, yet it was not correlated with ambient nitrogen concentrations nor did it increase with fertilization of the water column. These results can be reconciled by considering herbivory by Idotea resecata. In the laboratory, the isopod reduced epiphyte biomass by one-third and in its absence, epiphyte biomass increased with increasing nitrogen concentrations in the water column and negatively affected eelgrass growth.

AB We measured the field metabolic rate (FMR) and water influx rate (WIR) of the largest species of bird, the Ostrich (Struthio camelus), which lives in the Namib desert, one of the driest regions on earth. Along with doubly-labeled water (DLW) measurements of FMR and WIR, we examined the availability of plants in various habitats, the plants selected by Ostriches, and the daily activity patterns of these birds. During 6-8 d periods, adult Ostriches (88.25 kg) had an FMR of 18 040 kJ/d, while subadult birds (50.75 kg) metabolized energy at a rate of 15 428 kJ/d. Adult energy expenditure was 26% lower than predicted, but subadults had an FMR nearly equivalent to expectation, suggesting that adults may be more efficient at acquiring resources. Conclusions remain tentative because data for the Ostrich exceed previous data used for allometric equations by almost an order of magnitude.
   Gravel and stoney plains together accounted for 84% of the study area, whereas washes occupied < 1%. Vegetation cover was sparse in all habitats, varying between 7 and 19% in most areas, but comprising almost-equal-to 15% along drainage lines. Ostriches foraged on gravel plains nearly 65% of their daytime hours and 25.5% of their day in washes. They consumed a narrow range of green plants with Monechma arenicola, Schmidita kalahariensis, Blepharis spp., Trianthema triquetra, and Dicoma capensis representing the principal items in the diet.
   From a time-activity budget, Ostriches spent 7.5 h of their 24-h day walking, and roosted at night for 11.5 h. Transport between food patches accounted for 62.2% of FMR while nighttime rest was 19.0%. Preening and other maintenance behaviors were responsible for < 1% of the Ostriches' energy budget.
   Ostriches had a frugal water economy when compared to other nonpasserine birds, with both subadults and adults having lower WIRs than predicted. Values for WIR were higher than allometric predictions based on four other desert birds previously studied, but because Ostriches are two orders of magnitude larger in body mass, firm conclusions await further data. Calculations of the water economy index (WEI), the ratio of water influx to FMR (in millilitres of water per kilojoule), showed that Ostriches conserved water like smaller desert birds. Four species of desert birds had WEI values averaging 0.16 mL/kJ; values for the Ostrich averaged 0.17 mL/kJ.
   An itemized water budget suggested that adults did not drink during the periods of observation, while water intake by subadults averaged 729 ml/d. This suggests that adults may have lower minimum water requirements than subadults.
   Combining available data for FMR and WIR with data for the Ostrich, we constructed new allometric equations that nearly span the entire range of bird size and include 62 species of birds.

AB Attempts to fit simple mathematical models-of animal movement to observed distributions of movements have been extremely successful. However, the extent to which these results were influenced by use of potentially distance-weighted sampling methods has not been evaluated. Of the 15 field studies used to test model fits, 13 used methods that sample unevenly over distance. We use a simple Monte-Carlo simulation model to evaluate the effects of unequal sampling over distance on results obtained from simple mathematical models of animal movement. For three data sets that provide detailed maps of observation sites, the effects of unequal sampling are profound. Prior to sampling, data simulated by our model follow a uniform distribution, but a geometric model adequately fits the ''sampled'' simulated data. Following corrections to the field data to mitigate the effects of distance-weighted sampling, in only one of five studies do simple mathematical models adequately fit the observed distribution of movements.

AB We investigated how the pattern of leaf damage influences reproduction, growth, and allocation in the wild radish, Raphanus sativus (Brassicaceae). We removed an equivalent leaf area from plants with four leaves in five treatments ranging from concentrated to dispersed damage: one entire mature leaf removed, one entire new leaf removed, 50% of two mature leaves removed, 50% of two new leaves removed, and 25% of all four leaves removed. Plants in a control group were undamaged. Reproduction, growth, and allocation were not affected by the age of the damaged leaf. However, the pattern of leaf damage significantly affected our three measures of plant fitness: the number of flowers produced, the reproductive biomass, and the total biomass. Plants in the treatment in which the damage was most dispersed had significantly higher flower number, reproductive biomass, and total biomass than an intermediate damage treatment and significantly more reproductive biomass than the concentrated damage treatment. There were no significant differences between the concentrated and intermediate damage treatments and no differences between the dispersed damage treatment and the undamaged control. Our data indicate that more dispersed damage is less detrimental to the plant than more concentrated damage. Therefore, the pattern of leaf damage must be considered in determining the impact of herbivores on plant performance.

AB Optimal foraging theory assumes that individuals maximizing a given energy currency maximize their fitness. Though models with different currencies (and assumptions) have been successful at describing forager behavior, discriminating among currencies has proven difficult because models optimizing different currencies often make similar predictions. A field experiment was designed to use flight speeds of Black Terns (Chlidonias nigra) feeding their young to test predictions from optimal foraging models that maximize (1) the net energy gained per unit of energy expended (efficiency; EFF), (2) the net rate of energy intake (NREI), and (3) the daily delivery rate (DR), respectively. Manipulating the distance an adult had to fly between a feeding enclosure and its nest enabled us to discriminate among the three currencies. Predicted speeds of the EFF model best matched the observed flight speeds. Maximizing efficiency resulted in the lowest delivery rate to the nest, but it was also the only currency that predicted adult daily energy expenditures within the theoretical limit (DEE(max)) estimated for Black Terns (206 kJ/d; Kirkwood 1983).
   The feeding enclosure represented an unusually profitable food source for the terns, and this may have resulted in artificially high predictions for flight speed, particularly for the NREI and DR currencies. We therefore made another set of predictions from the three models using estimates of foraging success from parents who had never foraged from the feeding enclosure, and compared these predictions with the measured airspeeds. The EFF model was apain the best predictor of flight speeds even though none of the three models predicted energy expenditures in excess of DEE(max).  Though the DR model resulted in the highest total daily energy delivered to the nest, this represented only a small gain relative to the NREI and EFF models. Black Tem parents may maximize EFF because this currency is least likely to result in daily energy expenditures that exceed their metabolic limit.

AB In most mathematical models of population dynamics in ecological communities, the death rate of prey species is a linearly increasing function of the density of their predator(s). If antipredator behavior is incorporated into such models it becomes very unlikely that prey death rate is a linear function of predator density. In addition, it is possible for the prey death rate to decrease, rather than increase, as a function of the population density of its predator. Decreasing predation rates may be common when the prey organism is attempting to accumulate resources for growth or reproduction. Decreasing predation rates are less likely when the prey organism is attempting to minimize mortality. These results and earlier ones on indirect effects generated by optimal foraging (Abrams 1984, 1991a, b) suggest that higher order interactions should be extremely common in natural communities.

AB A sampling view of the colonization of small habitat fragments by birds is based on the assumption that individual birds acquire territories in the fragments randomly, and their occurrence frequencies follow from abundances in the regional species pool. We tested the following predictions of this view using bird census data from a fragment ''archipelago'' in the southern Finnish taiga: (1) the location of breeding pairs varies randomly among the fragments from year to year, and (2) the pattern of species accrual with increasing sample size is similar to random sampling. The data agreed with the predictions. For most species the distribution of pairs in the fragments agreed with the Poisson prediction. The pattern of species turnover in single fragments agreed with the sampling view so that an average fragment had about 10 pairs of 7 species in a single breeding season, and about 40 pairs of 13 species over the 4-yr period. The sampling model is a ''null'' assumption that should be considered when assessing the occurrence of birds in small habitat fragments. This requirement defines methodological imperatives that have often been violated in ornithological studies; we discuss such methodological problems. The sampling model implies that local turnover in small fragments may be a mechanical reflection of change in territory location from year to year and disconnected from population dynamics. In such a case, apparent ''extinctions'' and ''recolonizations'' in single fragments are ecologically trivial. Assessing the interface between sampling colonization and genuine metapopulation dynamics is an urgent challenge for conservation ecology, particularly in temperate and boreal areas.

AB In order to clarify the role of zooplankton in the cycling of elements and its subsequent effect on algal populations, food elimination and nutrient release rates by zooplankton in a small pond dominated by daphnids were estimated for nitrogen and phosphorus from April to September. Comparison of the elemental contents of food and zooplankton showed that N was the element in shortest supply in the food sources utilized by zooplankton. The net clearance rate of the zooplankton was higher for N than for P and C throughout the study period, indicating that these organisms can eliminate the scarcest element from the food pool with a higher efficiency. Soluble N and P released by the zooplankton consisted mainly of ammonium nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus, and on a dry mass basis N release ranged from 0.27 to 1.05 mug.mg-1.h-1 and P release from 0.045 to 0.30 mug.mg-1.h-1. Statistical analysis revealed that the N release rate was most affected by food abundance, whereas the P release rate and N:P release ratio were affected by the N:P ratio of the food.
   The net production rate of the zooplankton, estimated from the difference between elimination and release rates, showed a quite similar N:P ratio to that of the body tissue, indicating that zooplankton can keep their elemental composition roughly constant even if the N:P ratio of their food supply varies. Thus, the N and P release rates of zooplankton are linked through processes maintaining the elemental composition of body tissues.
   The present results indicate that the cycling rate of an element in pelagic systems depends highly on the grazer's requirements as well as the relative abundances of other elements. Zooplankton can modify the nutritional environment for algae through accumulation and regeneration processes, as suggested by recent theoretical models.

AB Data from a long-term study of Wood Ducks (Aix sponsa) breeding in South Carolina were used to test whether reproductive performance was age specific and to evaluate several hypotheses proposed for age-specific variation. We used known-aged females from 1 through 5 yr of age. Yearling females initiated nests 11-19 d later than older females; heavier females, independent of age, nested earlier than lighter females. One-way analyses of covariance using female body mass and nesting date as covariates indicated that clutch size, mean egg mass, number of ducklings per nest, and the percentage of eggs hatching (hatching success) were independent of female age. Probability of nests producing at least one duckling (nest success) also was not related to female age. We separately tested effects of breeding experience and female age class (yearling vs. adult) on reproductive performance. In the context of this study, females were considered as experienced if they previously were captured using nest boxes and inexperienced if there was no record of nest box use. Adult females with previous breeding experience initiated nests an average of 26 d earlier than adults without previous experience; body mass of experienced adults was greater than that of inexperienced adults. Adult females designated as ''inexperienced'' may have nested previously in natural cavities and were simply changing to nest boxes. Nest-site fidelity is known to affect nesting date, so we also compared nesting dates of inexperienced adults with a subset of experienced females that changed nest sites. Inexperienced adults nested 12 d later than experienced adults that switched nest sites and were nesting on different wetlands from the previous year. Next, we controlled nesting experience and tested specifically for age effects by comparing inexperienced adults with yearlings. Nesting date of inexperienced adults and yearling females did not differ, but body mass of these adults was greater than that of yearlings. There was no evidence that differential survival of heavy, early-nesting yearling females explained age-related patterns in nesting date and female body mass. In fact, late-nesting yearlings survived better than yearling females that initiated nests early. Furthermore, Jolly-Seber estimates of annual survival did not decline with female age, suggesting that older females were able to compensate for any increase in reproductive effort associated with early initiation of nests. Binary regression analyses showed that later nesting females were less likely to initiate second nests and more likely to have nests destroyed by predators. Female Wood Ducks nesting early produced larger clutches, hatched more young from successful nests, were at less risk from predators, and improved their chances of initiating second nests. Adult females at southern latitudes, therefore, should begin nesting as early as possible. Yearling females survive better if they begin nesting later in their 1 st yr.

AB Plant performance and chemistry may vary due to a variety of factors, such as plant genotype, environmental conditions, presence of herbivores, timing of herbivory, and species of herbivore. The relative importance of these factors, and how the plants respond,to them, may affect the dynamics of the plant population, as well as the insect herbivores feeding on those plants. To understand the relative importance of some of these factors on plant performance and chemistry, we used Plantago lanceolata L. (Plantaginaceae). In an experimental garden at Binghamton, New York, we examined the effects of plant age, plant genotype, and herbivory by generalist or specialist caterpillars on P. lanceolata. There were two parts to this experiment. In the first, we examined variation in nutritional quality (nitrogen) and defensive chemistry (the iridoid glycosides aucubin and catalpol) As a consequence of plant age, plant genotype, and leaf age class. We compared these parameters for a set of four pairs of plants of each of five genotypes that were not exposed to herbivores, and were harvested in early July (control-start plants) with another set harvested 6 wk later in mid-August (control-end plants). The older plants harvested in August (control-end plants) had concentrations of aucubin, catalpol, total iridoid glycosides, and nitrogen approximately one-half that of plants harvested 6 wk earlier. Leaf age affected all of these variables, and plant genotype influenced the iridoid glycoside variables but not the nitrogen concentration. Overall, leaf age explained twice as much of the variation in iridoid glycosides as did plant age, which accounted for twice as much variation as did plant genotype.
   The second part of the experiment compared the effects of herbivory, genotype, and leaf age on plant performance (leaf biomass, scape [flower stalk] biomass, and total biomass) and chemistry (nitrogen, protein, and iridoid glycoside concentration). We compared these measures for a set of four pairs of replicate plants of each of five genotypes, exposed to one of three herbivory treatments: no herbivory, herbivory by specialist caterpillars, and herbivory by_generalist caterpillars. The results of this experiment showed that herbivory had-little effect on plant performance, and there was no difference due to herbivory by the specialist Junonia coenia Hubner (Nymphalidae), compared to the generalist Spilosoma congrua Wlk. (Arctiidae). However, plant chemistry was significantly affected by herbivory. Herbivory by both caterpillar species induced iridoid glycosides and resulted in an increased concentration of catalpol and an increase in the proportion of catalpol relative to total iridoid glycosides in those plants exposed to herbivores compared to controls. In addition, plants exposed to specialist caterpillars had higher concentrations of catalpol and a higher proportion of-total iridoids that was catalpol than those exposed to generalist caterpillars. Overall, in this experiment, leaf age explained three times as much of the variation in iridoid glycosides as did plant genotype and herbivory. The results of the two parts of this experiment show that iridoid glycoside concentration in P. lanceolata leaves decreases over time, and that exposure to herbivores induces increased concentrations of iridoid glycosides.

AB This paper explores how suspended clays alter the trophic interactions that govern composition and density of the zooplankton community in a small eutrophic North Carolina (USA) lake. Enclosures (12 m3) were used in a complete, triplicated, cross-classified design. The four treatments were; BASS (1 piscivorous fish/enclosure), BASS + CLAY, SUNFISH (16 planktivorous fish/enclosure), SUNFISH + CLAY. The + CLAY treatments received 100 g.m-2.d-1 of montmorillonitic clay. It was anticipated that turbidity from clay would release crustacean zooplankton from visual planktivores. Contrary to this expectation, crustacean zooplankton populations in the SUNFISH + CLAY were fourfold less than in the SUNFISH treatment. The reduction was not linked to deleterious effects of clay, since zooplankton populations were higher in the BASS + CLAY than the BASS treatment. Instead, crustacean zooplankton appeared to be governed primarily by Chaoborus predation. Suspended clay weakened the link between visually predaceous fish and Chaoborus, which in turn strengthened the effect of Chaoborus predation on crustacean zooplankton. Since fish selectively cropped larger instars of Chaoborus, rotifers (primarily Keratella cochlearis), which are mostly eaten by smaller instars of Chaoborus, were unaffected by clay.

AB A comprehensive understanding of the factors controlling predation risk in natural communities is dependent upon knowledge of both the patchiness of predator and prey populations in nature, and on the outcome of behavioral interactions between predator and prey individuals. While both of these areas of predation ecology are rich in theory and data, there are no models that permit these two fundamental components of predation risk to be combined in a quantitative way. Here a model is developed to combine these density risk and prey vulnerability components of predation. The model is used to estimate the contribution of predator and prey population overlap to predation risk, and to quantify both density risk and prey vulnerability components of predation risk for two planktonic invertebrate predators and five rotifer prey. Behavioral data from the literature are used to interpret the prey vulnerability values and demonstrate the utility of the model. The predation risk values obtained for each prey species also are compared to the intrinsic population growth rates (r(max)), taken from previous studies. In addition, I test the a priori hypothesis that prey population growth will be negative when predation risk exceeds r(max). The results reveal the presence of severe bottleneck periods where predation risk exceeds the r(max) of four of the five prey species, thus supporting the a priori prediction of negative population growth or extremely low prey populations during these periods.

AB We investigated web relocation and habitat selection in Latrodectus revivensis (Theridiidae), a widow spider that constructs webs on scattered shrubs in the Negev desert. We used repeated observations of individual spiders' habitat preferences, movements to new web sites, growth, fecundity, and survival under natural and manipulated habitat conditions to examine relationships between movement, habitat, and components of fitness. Our main objectives were to determine the spatial and temporal patterns of movement, and the causes, costs, and fitness consequences of shifting habitat.
   Repeated censuses of individually marked females showed that web relocation in L. revivensis is associated with spider growth. Spiders tended to move to larger shrubs after one or two molts, and the size of web components and web-site features scaled to body size. Moves occurred mainly in Spring (March-May), and most moves (74%) were by juveniles. The main cost of web relocation was increased mortality: there was a 40% chance of death during a move. A comparison of occupied shrubs with those available in the habitat indicated strong site selection involving seasonally varying and age-dependent preferences for particular shrub species, and a general preference for taller shrubs.
   Prey availability at shrubs (as measured by pitfall traps, and by prey remains in nests) varied spatially and was affected by shrub species and size. However these effects were small compared to habitat-wide temporal variation in prey availability, suggesting that web-site relocations would not result in substantially higher prey capture. Nonetheless, movement to larger shrubs resulted in improved spider body condition and, ultimately, greater reproductive success. The advantages of web-site relocation in this species may relate to architectural features of shrubs that provide support for the web, and minimize exposure to thermal extremes and to predators. However, experimental manipulation of exposure by trimming shrubs did not decrease spider fitness. We suggest that web-site selection in this species is less precise than expected because of the risk of dying during a move.

AB Modifications of male life history due to sexual selection should be apparent in polygynous species such as elephant seals, in which sexual selection has produced a high degree of sexual dimorphism. In theory, male traits that confer a mating advantage bear survival disadvantages. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between sexual selection and life history patterns in male northern elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris. A life table, with age-specific estimates of mortality and reproduction, was constructed for male elephant seals from resighting data of tagged seals. Increased age-specific mortality was associated with the period of first reproduction by males, which occurred from 6-10 yr of age. A negative relationship was found between mating success and future survival in males that were beginning to breed. Older males showed no phenotypic costs to reproduction, and a positive, but not significant, relationship was shown between current mating success and future survival and mating success.

AB In dioecious plants, intersex differences in the frequency and size dependence of flowering may often be important proximate determinants of a population's flowering sex ratio. Such differences have been little investigated among Southeast Asian rain forest trees, where dioecy is perhaps best represented in the world's flora. In this study we recorded flowering activity and sex of reproductive individuals in two separate flowering seasons for almost-equal-to 2600 trees representing three species of Aporusa and two species of Baccaurea (all Euphorbiaceae) in a primary rain forest in peninsular Malaysia. We found neither sexually mixed trees nor sex switching of trees between years. Flowering sex ratios for the species of smallest stature, A. microstachya and B. parviflora, consistently exhibited a significant degree of male bias, which was greater in years with lower overall levels of flowering in the population. Two-year cumulative sex ratios were significantly male biased in these two species and in a second relatively small-statured species of Aporusa. The size distributions for male trees broadly overlapped those of female trees in all species. In the smaller statured species, male trees displayed a significantly greater degree of relative size variation than did female trees, suggesting that male trees begin flowering at a smaller size, but also grow to a larger size, than do females. Also, males were significantly more likely to flower in both years than were females in the smaller species studied.
   Sexual dimorphism in the frequency and size dependence of flowering has previously been explained as a result of higher energy costs of reproduction in females than in males. We suggest that this physiological constraint is most likely to play a strong role in energy-limited environments. We therefore predict that, as found in this study, male-biased sex ratios and associated patterns of sexual dimorphism may generally be most pronounced among diminutive treelets of the rain forest understory.

AB This study examined the consequences of differing daily time courses of light availability, while controlling for total photon flux density (PFD, measured in moles per square metre), on the physiology, architecture, and growth of seedlings of two birch species (Betula populifolia and B. alleghaniensis) that differ in shade tolerance. In an experimental garden, seedlings were grown in two sets of contrasting diurnal light regimes, ''gaps'' and ''shadehouses,'' and at four levels of total integrated PFD (almost-equal-to 12, 27, 50, and 70% of full sun). In gaps, seedlings received relatively more heterogeneous diurnal light regimes, with midday full sun peaks lasting between 40 and 280 min on sunny days, depending on pp size. In shadehouses, seedlings received daily total and average PFDs similar to that in gaps, but received no midday direct sunlight, and an overall more uniform distribution of light.
   The daily time course of light availability, independent of total PFD, significantly affected growth of seedlings. For both species, seedlings in shadehouses grew significantly larger than pp seedlings. Differences between diurnal treatments were greatest at lower integrated light levels in B. populifolia, but not for the more shade-tolerant B. alleghaniensis.
   Diurnal light regimes also significantly influenced the degree of plasticity in a seedling's sun-shade responses. However, the magnitude of effect due to diumal light regime depended on the particular trait investigated, the integrated light level, and the species. At similar total PFDs, most characters (e.g., specific leaf mass, leaf mass ratio) exhibited more of a sun-type response in shadehouses than in gaps, however, maximum net photosynthesis and chlorophyll a/b ratios reflected more of a sun-type response in gap light regimes.
   For most growth, physiological, and morphological characters, seedling responses to increasing total PFD were generally more sensitive in gap than in shadehouse regimes. Our results also show that differences between species were greater when compared along the total PFD gradient in gaps vs. shadehouses. Both these results suggest that experimental studies employing uniform light regimes, which incorporate little of the temporal variability experienced by seedlings in natural gaps, may underestimate plasticity within regenerating tree species, and the potential for species niche differences and coexistence.

AB Allometric theory on mechanisms of the self-thinning rule was tested for Nothofagus solandri populations from the Craigieburn Range, New Zealand and for Pinus densiflora stands from northern Japan. The self-thinning rule describes a consistent relationship of mean plant mass to the approximately -3/2 power of plant density in even-aged monocultures. Although this rule has been described for various species, mechanisms that produce certain relationships have not been well understood. We tested an allometric theory of Long and Smith of the self-thinning rule that assumes constant foliage mass density and allometry for mean dimensions of populations that represent densest conditions for given mean plant sizes. Only stands at maximum crowding were selected for analysis. The self-thinning boundary of N. solandri showed an exponent -1.13 with a 95% CI of -1.25 to -1.02 for mean stem mass. This was significantly shallower than the conventional value of the exponent -3/2, but was identical to the predicted exponent from the allometric theory. The thinning coefficient was also explained numerically by this hypothesis. In contrast, analysis of published data for P. densiflora indicated that the thinning exponent did not differ from the proposed -3/2. Empirical thinning tines varied substantially depending on species and plant parts considered; however, the allometric theory consistently provided predictions that agreed with the observed thinning relationships. Implications for the geometry of self-thinning populations and generality of the allometric theory are discussed.

AB Many small temperate-zone birds fatten in winter and use this reserve when food becomes unavailable. The winter body mass of migratory Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis) usually is greater where severe weather is more frequent, i.e., at higher latitudes or altitudes. The mechanism responsible for this geographic variation is unknown, and we asked whether geographically separated populations are composed of birds with different capacities or tendencies to fatten. We sampled the lipid index (LI, grams of lipid per gram of lean dry mass) of free-living juncos at three latitudes in two winters and found geographic variation. However, the pattern of variation in LI at the three latitudes was not consistent, either within or between winters.
   We also displaced wintering juncos from northern, intermediate, and southern sites and exposed them to a common environment in Indiana. One group of displaced birds was released in natural junco habitat (during three winters), and another was held outdoors in captivity (during two winters). Many released birds remained nearby, and when we recaptured some of them in late winter the LIs of the three geographic subgroups were statistically indistinguishable. It was also indistinguishable from the LI of juncos sampled at that time from the free-living Indiana population. Among the displaced birds that we held captive, we found no differences among the geographic subgroups either in LI or total body mass. In one of the years, late-winter LI and body mass of the captives did not differ from values for the released group or from values of newly caught Indiana juncos, but in the second year values for the captives were lower.
   Our results indicate that geographic variation in winter fattening of juncos is not a population-specific trait that persists independently of current environmental information and that it probably reflects a response to local environmental conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first experiment using free-living birds to test the role of the environment in maintaining geographic variation in a life history trait in the nonbreeding period.

AB Cause of patch formation was investigated on a 7.2 ha study area in Sylvania Wilderness Area, a primary forest remnant in Upper Michigan comprising a mosaic of hemlock, sugar maple, and mixed-forest patches. Spatial autocorrelation analysis of the stem map indicates that, although most species pairs have a neutral association between canopy trees and understory trees of other species, hemlock and sugar maple canopy trees both have strong positive self association and negative reciprocal association with each other. No species pairs have a positive reciprocal association on regeneration with each other.
   MOSAIC, a Markov simulation model in which transition probabilities depend on neighborhood species composition, shows that the negative reciprocal association between hemlock and sugar maple of the intensity observed in this study, could lead to spatial separation into monodominant patches over long time periods (3000 yr). The mixed-forest patches are along spatial continua of varying steepness between sugar maple and hemlock patches. Interactions between sugar maple and hemlock overstory and understory trees, along with the pattern of invasion of hemlock, provide a reasonable explanation for the patch structure. Pedological, topographical, and disturbance history differences do not coincide with the location of patches within upland forests on the study area.

AB Long-term studies are required for an understanding of how temporal variation and space-time interactions affect the structure of communities. Here we report on a long-term study of the independent effects of, and the interactions among, two sources of temporal variation (seasonal and annual) and two sources of spatial variation for a rocky intertidal community in the northern Gulf of California. The sources of spatial variation were: (1) microspatial effects due to the foraging patterns of a common predatory snail (Acanthina angelica) and (2) macrospatial effects due to differences among sites. The results from semiannual samples of 100-cm2 quadrats showed highly significant temporal and spatial effects for all members of the sessile community (barnacles, mussels, algae) and for limpets over the 8-yr study period. There were also highly significant season x space interactions for all sessile members of the community, which probably resulted from seasonal settlement by the sessile members of the community, and aestivation by the predator. Finally, we observed highly significant year x space effects as well as year x season x space effects for most species. These latter interactions can be understood as an amplification of seasonal and spatial effects due to the largely unpredictable differences among years.
   An analysis of the variance components showed that most of the variation in percentage cover of barnacles and a brown encrusting alga was due to microspatial effects, while most of the variation in mussels, limpets, and a green alp was due to year and season effects. This combination of results suggests that competition and predation by Acanthina are relatively more important in controlling the distributions and local abundances of barnacles and encrusting algae, and that unpredictable differences among years in settlement are more important in controlling the local population densities of mussels and limpets. The importance of these differences are discussed in relation to interpretation of short-term experimental studies in population and community studies.

AB Costs of reproduction measured under laboratory conditions may have little bearing on actual costs observed in the field, because both environmental conditions and behavior can modify the manifestation of these costs. I studied survival, growth, and reproduction in a wild population of southern water skinks (Eulamprus tympanum) over 3 yr to measure costs of reproduction in females, to examine how the environment influences these costs, and to assess the extent to which females are able to reduce costs. The proportion of mature females that reproduced each year varied from 30-60%. Frequent reproduction appeared costly in terms of both survival rates and growth. Growth rates and survival rates were negatively correlated with reproduction during the 3-yr study. In the coolest and wettest year of the study, when food intake by females was relatively low, gravid females and females that had reproduced in the previous year survived less well than nonreproducing females. There was no evidence of a survival cost of reproduction in the other two years of the study. Reproduction also imposed a fecundity cost, as overall, mean growth rates of reproducing females were reduced relative to those of nonreproducing females of the same body size. Reduced growth rate translates to reduced litter size in these skinks, because fecundity increases with body size. These results suggest that reproduction can be costly in terms of both survival and future reproduction in these skinks, but that survival costs are not consistent from year to year and are mediated by environmental conditions. Females appear to adjust their frequency of reproduction to minimize these costs, as those females that skipped opportunities for reproduction were those expected to gain the greatest growth and fecundity benefit by skipping.

AB Voles (Mammalia: Arvicolidae) are reported to be key consumers of tree seedlings in some habitats, but their importance in old-field succession is not known. Natural populations of voles fluctuate widely in density, and we sought to determine the effects of vole density on seedling predation. We used a randomized block design, with meadow voles maintained at three density levels (low, medium, high; three replicates of each) in field enclosures for 17 mo. We introduced young seedlings of five tree species into the enclosures. Three cohorts of seedlings were planted under intact vegetation, and one was planted in small areas from which we had cleared all vegetation. Overall predation rates were high for all cohorts planted under intact vegetation. There was a significant effect of vole density on seedling predation rates for two of these three cohorts; nearly all seedlings were destroyed in enclosures with high vole density. Predation rates by voles were highest for white ash and red maple, intermediate for white pine, and lowest for eastern hemlock and red oak. For the cohort planted in small clearings, mean predation rates were low and there was no density effect. Spatial variation in seedling predation rates was higher in enclosures with low and medium densities of voles than in high-density enclosures. In three of the cohorts there was a significant block effect, with the same block consistently having the highest predation rates. Evidence suggests that the block effect was caused by genetic differences among voles. Seedling predation by voles can: (1) delay old-field succession by reducing the number of tree invaders; (2) create patchiness by concentrating surviving seedlings in certain microsites; and (3) alter relative abundances of invading species via differences in palatability or apparency. We suggest that the population dynamics of voles be viewed as a keystone process in old-field succession.

AB Growth of vegetative and reproductive structures in Artemisia tridentata is temporally separated during the growing season; vegetative growth occurs during spring and early summer when soil moisture is most abundant, while reproductive growth occurs during summer and fall when soil moisture may be limiting. Vegetative and reproductive structures may therefore exhibit contrasting efficiencies of resource acquisition and investment resulting from temporal differences in resource availability during their development. We examined the effect of water stress on growth, photosynthesis, and resource investment for vegetative and reproductive modules of Artemisia tridentata by applying supplemental water. No differences were observed in vegetative biomass between shrubs in the two watering treatments. Growth of vegetative structures occurred in the spring when water was not limiting, and shrubs in both watering treatments exerted little stomatal control over water loss. Conversely, reproductive growth occurred through the summer when water was limiting, and supplemental watering increased reproductive growth. Shrubs conserved water during summer by abscising leaves and lowering stomatal conductance of both vegetative and reproductive modules in response to decreases in xylem pressure potential and increases in evaporative demand. Leaf abscission can occur without decreasing the amount of carbon available for reproductive growth because inflorescences are capable of positive photosynthetic rates comparable to vegetative leaves. Water stress did not alter tissue construction costs or carbon and nitrogen contents for either vegetative or reproductive modules. Resource limitations were, however, reflected in the efficiency of water use during tissue construction; floral leaves and floral heads of shrubs not receiving supplemental water were produced with higher water-use efficiency. Conservative use of water during production of vegetative modules would offer no advantage to A. tridentata because neighboring species are also most active at this time. Reproductive growth in A. tridentata occurs during summer when neighboring species are largely dormant, and so efficient use of water may allow development of reproductive structures to continue throughout the summer even with limited supplies of water.

AB To examine pathways in the evolution of prey specialization in insects, we conducted a comparative experimental analysis of larval behavior in two sympatric predacious sister-species (Chrysopa quadripunctata, a generalist, and C slossonae, a specialist on the woolly alder aphid). Responses of the larvae to food (Myzus persicae) and camouflaging material (waxy secretions from woolly alder aphids or exuviae from M. persicae) were quantified during four discrete developmental periods. Our analysis revealed species-specific, ontogenetic, and environmentally induced variation in larval defensive and feeding behavior. The pattem of interspecific variation indicates that larval behavior could have subserved two processes in the evolution of prey specialization in the sister-species' progenitor: establishment on a specific prey and adaptation to the prey. First, the presence of the woolly alder aphid's secretions results in generalist larvae camouflaging themselves to a degree that rivals that of the specialist. Such phenotypic plasticity could have promoted the progenitor's initial adoption of the ant-tended woolly alder aphid as prey and its wool as a source of camouflaging material. Second, quantitative differences between the generalist's s and specialist's behavior indicate that adaptation to the woolly alder aphid did not require the acquisition of novel behavioral traits in the larvae. It involved modifications in the expression of defensive behavior that existed in the generalist ancestor and alterations in the ability to attack and feed on robust prey.

AB Life history theory assumes that there is a trade-off between current reproduction and future growth or reproduction or both; therefore, natural selection is expected to result in the maximization of reproduction within the limits imposed by the trade-offs. Accordingly, it has been predicted that fruit and seed production in perennial plants should be resource limited. Many orchid species seem to be pollinator limited, but this hypothesis has been recently challenged by experimental studies that show a cost of increased fruit set in some orchids. In this study, I combined the results of a 2-yr pollination experiment and a 3-yr demographic assessment of a population of the orchid Tolumnia variegata in a matrix model of population dynamics, and by means of simulations I evaluated the effect of pollination intensity and frequency, fruit production, and cost of fruiting on the asymptotic population growth rate. Mean natural fruit set in this population was < 1%, whereas intermediate and high pollination intensity resulted in mean fruit set of 35 and 72%, respectively. In any given year, almost-equal-to 98% of all flowering individuals fail to set fruit under natural conditions. Despite the dramatic increase in fruit set after hand-pollination, only plants in the high pollination intensity treatment showed a statistically significant reduction in future growth and flowering. The simulations showed that a small seedling production per fruit would be enough to overcome the cost of fruiting; therefore, plants in this population should experience strong selection for increased pollination. This conclusion does not seem to explain the widespread occurrence of low fruit set and high proportion of fruiting failure among nonautogamous orchids. The results of this study suggest an alternative explanation: pollinator limitation could be evolutionarily stable if the correlation between fruit or seed production and seedling recruitment is sufficiently low. If an increase in fruit or seed production does not translate into an increase in fitness, then selection for increased pollination would not occur or would be too weak. To evaluate this alternative, quantitative studies on the transition from seed to seedling in natural orchid populations are required.

AB The stems of the resurrection plant Selaginella lepidophylla, a poikilohydrous desert pteridophyte, curl dramatically as the plants dry and uncurl when rewetted. We tested the hypothesis that stem curling is a morphological feature that may serve to limit bright-light and/or thermal damage in resurrection plants with a field experiment at a Chihuahuan desert site in west Texas. Experimental plants were irrigated for 3 d and then permitted to dry. The plants were either allowed to curl normally or mechanically restrained to prevent curling and either shaded (10% of ambient irradiance) or left fully exposed during desiccation. Nine days after complete desiccation, the plants were harvested and returned to the laboratory. When rehydrated, plants that had been unshaded and restrained from curling during field desiccation had significantly lower photosystem II electron transport rates, higher intrinsic chlorophyll fluorescence (F0) yields, lower variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence (F(v)/F(m)) yield ratios, lower chlorophyll contents, and both lower whole-plant photosynthetic quantum efficiencies and light-saturated CO2 assimilation rates relative to plants from the other desiccation treatments. The results of both low-irradiance and high-irradiance hydrations in the laboratory suggest that the curling during desiccation and the uncurling during rehydration of S. lepidophylla in its natural habitat serves to protect the plant from damage due to high irradiance, high temperature, or perhaps a synergistic combination of the two. This protection permits the rapid recovery of photosynthetic competence when next the plants are wetted, thereby helping to maximize net carbon balance over time.

AB Landscape variation in soil water relations, leaf xylem pressure potential (psi) and leaf-level net photosynthesis (A) in Andropogon gerardii, and net primary production (NPP) were evaluated during the 1989 and 1990 growing seasons in a northeast Kansas (USA) tallgrass prairie. Landscape patterns were assessed along transects that spanned upland and lowland topographic positions in an annually burned and a long-term unburned watershed. Landscape variability in volumetric soil water content (THETA) was significantly greater in the unburned watershed (coefficient of variation [cv] = 0.425 and 0.479 for 0-15 and 0-30 cm soil depths in unburned prairie vs. 0.285 and 0.330 for similar depths in the burned watershed). In both watersheds, significantly higher THETA and total soil water content (0-30 cm) were measured in lowlands compared to uplands. Topographic anomalies, such as a lowland ridge, resulted in local, small-scale variation in soil moisture that equaled watershed variation. Variation across landscapes in predawn psi, which was expected to reflect soil water content, was similar in both watersheds (cv = 0.312). Variation in midday psi was significantly greater across the burned than the unburned watershed in 1990 (maximum range in psi from uplands to lowlands was 0.708 MPa at predawn and 0.662 MPa at midday in the burned watershed). In both watersheds, variation in midday psi was much lower relative to THETA. Landscape patterns in leaf-level A in A. gerardii, the dominant species in this tallgrass prairie, were inconsistent when upland and lowland sites were compared. During an extended period of drought, A was significantly higher in plants in the unburned watershed. In both watersheds, NPP was strongly correlated with THETA. However, variability in NPP across topographic gradients in the unburned watershed was much less pronounced (cv = 0.224-0.245) than in the annually burned watershed (cv = 0.364-0.430). Moreover, the slope of the relationship between NPP and THETA was significantly greater in the annually burned watershed.
   We propose that relatively uniform energy limitations across topographic gradients in unburned tallgrass prairie, caused by detrital accumulation that absorbs/reflects sunlight, reduced topographic variability in NPP in unburned watersheds. This pattern occurred in unburned watersheds despite greater landscape variation in THETA relative to burned watersheds. Analysis of long-term records of NPP from several watersheds supported the hypothesis that variability in NPP associated with topographic position is lower in unburned vs. burned watersheds. Variability in psi across watersheds and between years was muted by negative feedback of canopy leaf area (transpiring surface) on plant-soil water relations. We concluded that patterns in landscape variability in A and psi, which may vary significantly over short time intervals, were not good predictors of seasonal carbon dioxide exchange or productivity in this tallgrass prairie. Nonetheless, interactions between A and psi, when combined with nitrogen and energy limitations to A, provide the mechanisms for integrated responses measured across these landscapes.

AB We studied how an enriched CO2 atmosphere in a fully crossed design of light and nutrients, influenced 1 st-yr seedling growth in six New England deciduous forest tree species. The species, in the order of increasing shade tolerance, were gray birch (Betula populifolia), ash (Fraxinus americana L.), red maple (Acer rubrum L.), red oak (Quercus rubra L.), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britton), and striped maple (Acerpensylvanicum). Elevated CO2 environments significantly stimulated the seedling growth of all six species. Generally this was more pronounced in low light. The greatest stimulation was found under the condition of low light and high nutrients. However, individual species responded differently to elevated CO2 levels. Among the three early-successional species, gray birch, ash, and red maple, a significant increase in seedling growth under elevated CO2 conditions was found only with high nutrients. The three late-successional species grown under elevated CO2 conditions (red oak, yellow birch, and striped maple) showed a greater percentage increase in seedling growth in low light than in high light. Thus, for the early-successional species, the degree of enhancement of seedling growth by elevated CO2 levels was more sensitive to nutrient levels, while in the late-successional species the enhancement was more sensitive to the level of light. Moreover, species with large seeds (e.g., red oak) exhibited a greater response to elevated CO2 levels under low light than species with small seeds (e.g., gray birch).
   The results emphasize the importance of plant species as well as other environmental resources in modifying the response of plants to elevated CO2. Considering the light and nutrient environment observed in forest gaps of various sizes, the results of the present experiment suggest seedling regeneration in New England deciduous forests may be altered in a future high CO2 environment.

AB In a population of Blue Tits, Parus caeruleus, we performed two different food provisioning experiments; one starting before clutch initiation and one starting when the first eggs were laid. We assessed the effect of these feeding experiments on four fitness-related factors, viz., laying date, clutch size, egg mass, and onset of incubation.
   Given that breeding birds are food and energy constrained, extra food during the breeding season should be invested in the fitness-related factor(s) that is most important for maximization of overall fitness. In the first feeding experiment, when breeding pairs had access to extra food both before and during egg-laying, the female converted this extra energy into earlier laying dates. When food was provided after clutch initiation only, the above preferred option was no longer available. In this situation, females used the extra energy to start incubating earlier in the laying sequence, with no influence on the other factors studied.
   Thus, both experiments resulted in surplus energy being used to increase the quality of the offspring instead of their number. In both cases the quality was connected with time savings leading to earlier hatching dates.

AB We studied foraging energetics in Adelie Penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) using doubly labeled water (DLW) and time-depth recorders (TDR). Measurements were made during three nesting stages: late incubation, the guard stage (when small chicks were continuously guarded by at least one parent), and the subsequent creche stage (when large chicks were left unattended). Nest relief cycle times decreased from 229 h during incubation to 33.3 h during the creche stage, and the fraction of time birds spent swimming increased from 20.8% during incubation to 31.6% during the creche stage. The fraction of swim time spent in hunting dives and bottom time did not change significantly at different nesting stages. Field metabolic rates (FMR) were 2.73 x basal metabolic rate (BMR) during incubation, 3.03 x BMR during the guard stage, and 3.29 x BMR during the creche stage; due to high variance these values did not differ significantly. Estimated metabolic rate during swimming was 8.2 x BMR. Rates of prey capture (grams of krill per hour of swimming, per hour of hunting dives, and per hour of bottom time) did not change at different stages. Food provided to chicks was 20.9% (guard stage) to 23.3% (creche stage) of the food metabolized by adults. Our data suggest that (1) prey capture by Adelies is limited primarily by their ability to find krill swarms and not by limitations in harvest rates or energy efficiency after prey have been located, and (2) reproductive effort in Adelies does not require a large increase in either energy expenditures or foraging time.

AB An important mycorrhizal mutualism in plants is known to be influenced by herbivory. In contrast to most previous studies that have focused on grass and crop species, here we examine this interaction with trees of known resistance and susceptibility to insect attack under field conditions. To examine the potential interactions between ectomycorrhizae and herbivory, we quantified the levels of ectomycorrhizal colonization of almost-equal-to 30-yr-old pinyon pines (Pinus edulis) that were either resistant or susceptible to the sap-feeding scale insect Matsucoccus acalyptus. Resistant trees had lower scale survivorship and retained more of their foliage over a 7-yr period than susceptible trees. Resistant trees also had 28% more ectomycorrhizae than susceptible trees. To examine the cause of these ectomycorrhizal differences we removed scales from susceptible trees and compared their levels of ectomycorrhizal colonization with those of susceptible and resistant control trees. Following the removal of scales, the levels of ectomycorrhizal colonization of susceptible trees rebounded and did not differ from those of trees resistant to scale attack. These results demonstrate that herbivory by scale insects reduces the ectomycorrhizae of susceptible trees.

AB Spatial patterns in natural N-15 abundance (deltaN-15) in soil, soil solutions, and non-N2-fixing plants were studied in the deciduous forest on Walker Branch Watershed near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that foliar deltaN15 values are related to the availability of inorganic nitrogen in mineral soil. Soils collected in or near valley bottoms on the watershed had higher levels of net nitrogen mineralization and net nitrification potential than those sampled from ridges and slopes. More positive foliar deltaN-15 values occurred in valley bottoms, which, relative to other positions on the watershed, were characterized by greater availability of soil nitrogen and lower C-to-N ratios in the O(i)-horizon, in the surface mineral soil, and in autumn leaf fall. Although leaf nitrogen concentrations changed significantly over the course of the growing season, there was little seasonal variation in foliar deltaN-15 values. A hypothesis about the relative importance of different sources of nitrogen to the forest and how nitrogen cycling varies with topography in this nitrogen-deficient ecosystem was derived, in part, from spatial patterns in natural N-15 abundance. There appear to be two processes affecting the topographic patterns in foliar N-15 abundance on this watershed: (1) greater uptake from isotopically heavy pools of inorganic soil nitrogen by plants in valley bottoms, and (2) uptake of isotopically light ammonium-N in atmospheric deposition by plants on ridges and slopes (where the availability of inorganic soil nitrogen to plant roots is more limited). Results from this study indicate that foliar deltaN-15 values are positively correlated with net nitrification potential in surface soil.

AB For herbivores, food quality is a major component of habitat quality. However, food quality is complex to assess because it must integrate not only the availability of nutrients but also their digestibility and the requirements of the animal. To evaluate the quality of food and to determine the feeding constraints faced by young herbivores, we compared two brood-rearing habitats used by the Greater Snow Goose (Chen caerulescens atlantica) in the High Arctic using three levels of investigation. The first was based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the plants; the second was behavioral, and compared the feeding effort of human-imprinted goslings; and the third was physiological and compared food selection and plant nutrient metabolizability by the goslings. The two habitats grazed by goslings were a sedge meadow (dominated by Carex aquatilis and Dupontia fisheri) and a grass meadow (dominated by Dupontia fisheri and Eriophorum spp.). Plant biomass was higher in the sedge than in the grass meadow. Plant quality declined during the summer but Eriophorum spp. had a significantly higher nitrogen and lower fiber content than the other two species at all times. However, when combining data on quality and relative abundance, the overall plant quality was similar in both meadows. Goslings spent more time feeding and had a higher pecking rate in the grass than in the sedge meadow. Comparison of diet quality to overall plant quality indicated a higher nitrogen and lower fiber content of the diet in the grass meadow but not in the sedge meadow, probably because goslings fed selectively on Eriophorum in the former habitat. Apparent metabolizability of organic matter and nitrogen, and nitrogen assimilation efficiency by goslings were lower in the sedge than in the grass meadow at some periods. However, goslings did not compensate by an increased rate of food intake when their nitrogen intake was low which suggests that they had reached their gastrointestinal capacity. Under some circumstances, food quality is therefore more important than food abundance for herbivores. We show that integration of our three levels of investigation (plant food, animal behavior, and physiology) is essential to fully evaluate habitat quality for an herbivore.

AB In order to relate the isotopic composition of soil organic matter to parent vegetation and soil type, we measured the carbon stable isotope ratios of tree leaves and soil C at 14 locations in a temperate forest. Sites were selected over a wide variety of soil types and related vegetation associations, but within a single regional climate. The deltaC-13 of the bulk leaf material falling on the soil varied among sites, ranging from -29.5 to -26 parts per thousand. Within this range, differences up to 1.5 parts per thousand were attributable to differences in tree species. Further differences were related to site. The deltaC-13 values of soil organic matter cover the range -29.8 to -24.3 parts per thousand and varied with both parent vegetation deltaC-13 and depth. Transformation and decay of organic C within the litter layers led to no isotope enrichment, irrespective of vegetation and humus type: mull, hydromull, moder, or anmoor. The difference between woody and leaf material in litter was low, 0.23 +/- 0.35 parts per thousand (mean +/- 1 SD). On the other hand deltaC-13 in mineral horizons always increased with depth, reaching values richer than litter by 1.0 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand at 20 cm and up to + 1.5 parts per thousand at 1 m. The trend was independent of the soil physico-chemical characteristics, whether aerobic, anaerobic, eutrophic, oligotrophic, or podzolic. Isotope ratios of soil organic C in forests appear to provide useful estimators of tree isotopic composition. When compared to the measurements of the vegetation, they offer the advantage of an easily obtained value that naturally integrates over plant material, time and, eventually, local area.

AB To investigate the influence of winter climate on freezing tolerance at the population level, minimum January air temperatures in the field and cold acclimation determined in the laboratory were compared for Opuntia fragilis. Populations occurred at 20 locations as far north as 56-degrees-46' N latitude and at elevations up to 3029 m in Canada and the United States, most of which experience extreme freezing temperatures each winter. Low-temperature responses and water relations of stems were examined in the laboratory at day/night air temperatures of 25-degrees/15-degrees-C and 14 d after the plants were shifted to a 5-degrees/-5-degrees-C temperature cycle. Cold acclimation averaged 17-degrees-C and freezing tolerance averaged -29-degrees-C for the 20 populations following a shift to low day/night air temperatures, indicating that 0. fragilis has the greatest cold acclimation ability and the greatest freezing tolerance reported for any cactus. Moreover, freezing tolerance and cold acclimation were both positively correlated (r2 congruent-to 0.7) with the minimum temperatures at the 20 locations. Plants lost water during low-temperature acclimation, leading to 30% decreases in cladode and chlorenchyma thickness; the decrease in water content was greater for the five warmest populations than for the five coldest ones. Over the same period, the average osmotic pressure of the chlorenchyma increased from 1.42 to 1.64 MPa, and the relative water content (RWC) decreased from 0.58 to 0.49, but the average osmotic pressure of saturated chlorenchyma was unchanged, indicating no net change in solute content during acclimation. Although the role of water relations in freezing tolerance is unclear, the substantial freezing tolerance and cold acclimation ability of O. fragilis leads to its distribution into regions of Canada and the United States that experience minimum temperatures below -40-degrees-C during the winter.

AB Analysis of habitat use based on radio-tagged animals presents difficulties inadequately addressed by current methods. Areas of concern are sampling level, data pooling across individuals, non-independence of habitat proportions, differential habitat use by groups of animals, and arbitrary definition of habitat availability. We advocate proportional habitat use by individual animals as a basis for analysis. Hypothesis testing of such nonstandard multivariate data is done by compositional analysis, which encompasses all MANOVA/MANCOVA-type linear models. The applications to habitat use range from testing for age class, effects or seasonal differences, to examining relationships with food abundance or home range size. We take as an example the comparison of habitat use and availability. The concepts are explained and demonstrated on two data sets, illustrating different methods of treating missing values. We compare utilized with available habitats in two stages, examining home range selection within the overall study area first, then habitat use within the home range. At each stage, assuming that use differs from random, habitats can be ranked according to relative use, and significant between-rank differences located. Compositional analysis is also suited to the analysis of time budgets or diets.

AB Using experimental manipulations, we examined pollen and resource limitations to seed production and their interaction in a natural population of a monocarpic plant, Ipomopsis aggregata. Our design crossed two factors, pollen level (hand-pollinated or control) and resource level (water added, water and fertilizer added, or control). Both hand-pollination and fertilizing during the blooming season increased total seed production, while watering alone had no effect on any component of reproductive success. Hand-pollination boosted number of seeds per flower, with no effect on flower number. In contrast, fertilizing had its primary effect on the number of flowers produced, while also increasing the number Of seeds per mature fruit in hand-pollinated plants. Fertilizing increased nectar volume, but path analysis detected no indirect effect of this increased reward rate on seed production, suggesting instead that fertilizing had a slight, but direct, effect on seeds per flower. These results argue against a strict dichotomy between pollen limitation and resource limitation of female reproductive success in plants.

AB Using a variety of techniques we estimated energy expenditure and allocation of energy in free-living green iguanas (Iguana iguana) in a seasonal environment on Curacao, Netherlands Antilles.
   1) Daily energy expenditure (DEE) was measured by means of the doubly labeled water (DLW) technique, using O-18 and deuterium (H-2). The method was validated in green iguanas at ambient temperature and humidity levels occurring on Curacao. Energy expenditures from the DLW method differed by 2.1 +/- 8.2% compared to respirometry and balance methods. This value falls within the range of deviations found in other validation studies, and indicates that the DLW method is acceptable in green iguanas even at high ambient humidity.
   2) Average DEE was 71.7 kJ . kg-1.d-1. There were no significant differences in DEE between males and females, although males tended to have higher metabolic rates during the mating season. Energy expenditure on a yearly basis including clutch production in females did not differ between females and males, indicating comparable annual levels of energy expenditure between the sexes.
   3) Temperature dependence of standard metabolic rate (SMR) and resting metabolic rate (RMR) were determined by respirometry experiments. RMR increased with temperature with a Q10 of 2.24. In combination with field body temperatures SMR and RMR of free-living iguanas could be determined. SMR amounted to 15-22% of the DEE. DEE was 1.8-2.8 times RMR.
   4) The energy expenditure above RMR was allocated between activities involving locomotion and stationary activities. DEE in combination with behavioral data revealed an indirect measure of the costs linked to locomotion in the field, including climbing (255 kJ.km-1.kg-1). Locomotion with a climbing component imposed six times the costs of horizontal walking. Although time spent locomoting was only a very small fraction of the total time, the costs linked to locomotor activities amounted to almost-equal-to 23% of the daily energy expenditure. Postural adjustment costs were almost-equal-to 33% of the DEE. Locomotion could explain 78% of the observed variation in DEE. If other activities, such as foraging and social activities, were included in multiple regression analyses, 96% of the variation in DEE could be explained.
   5) Body condition of males decreased during the mating period (March/April), while most of the decrease in body condition of females occurred during the time of oviposition (May/June). Time spent in social activities was higher during the mating period, especially so in males, but time devoted to other activities (locomotion, foraging) did not differ significantly between the seasons. Comparison between the sexes revealed that males spent more time locomoting than females, throughout the year.
   6) Differences in body condition in the course of the year were not due to differences in DEE, but were mainly a result of differences in metabolizable energy intake. Though on a yearly basis energy expenditure was equal in both sexes, energy allocation differed between the sexes. Females devoted almost-equal-to 15% of their annual energy budget to the production of eggs, while males showed heightened social activity during the mating phase and spent twice as much time in locomotor activities than females.

AB The objective of this work was to determine whether introduction of a bacterium altered microbial communities associated with roots. We conducted experiments in the field and in a growth chamber to determine whether coating soybean seeds with marked strains derived from the biological control agent Bacillus cereus UW85 affected the bacterial community in the rhizosphere of soybeans. We characterized 2651 individual isolates of bacteria from root-free soil and from soybean seedlings based on 43-50 physiological attributes. Discriminant analysis of the bacterial communities according to these attributes showed that the communities of rhizosphere bacteria that developed on nontreated plants and on plants grown from seeds coated with a single strain of bacteria were sometimes dramatically different. This occurred even when the introduced strain did not persist as a common member of the community. In two of four experiments we could as easily differentiate between bacterial communities on roots of UW85-treated and nontreated seedlings as between the communities in the rhizosphere and root-free soil. In the other two experiments we could differentiate only between communities in root-free soil and on roots. In the comparison of bacteria from root-free soil and from the soybean rhizosphere, we found that bacteria from root-free soil were more likely to degrade complex carbon sources than were rhizosphere bacteria, whereas bacteria from roots were resistant to more antimicrobial substances and were able to grow on a wider range of simple carbon sources than were bacteria isolated from root-free soil.

AB The isopod Caecidotea intermedius serves as the intermediate host for the acanthocephalan Acanthocephalus dirus. C intermedius is preyed upon by the northern creek chub, Semotilus atromaculatus, which also serves as the definitive host for A. dirus. The effects of the parasite on the antipredator behavior of C intermedius were examined. We tested the hypothesis that behavioral changes induced in C intermedius by the parasite are by-products of increased energy demands induced by the parasite (i.e., increased hunger). Infected and uninfected C intermedius were placed in a divided aquarium with 0, 1, or 2 creek chubs. Leaf discs provided both a food source and a refuge from the predator. In the presence of the creek chubs, uninfected C intermedius avoided the predator, and were found more frequently in refugia as the number of creek chubs increased. However, infected C intermedius were associated with the side of the aquarium containing the predator, and spent significantly more time out in the open away from the refuge regardless of the number of creek chubs. These data show that the antipredator behavior exhibited by C. intermedius is altered by A. dirus, and that such alterations are unlikely to be simply products of increased energy demands. Parasite-induced behavioral changes appear to increase C intermedius' vulnerability to predation, thereby increasing the likelihood of A. dirus completing its life cycle. We find little evidence for greater foraging need as the mechanism indicating changes in antipredator behavior.

AB In a 4-yr study of the reproductive strategies of Cooper's Hawks (Accipiter cooperii) nesting in north-central New Mexico, >50% of the females deserted during the fledgling-dependency period and did not renest. A dynamic state variable model was developed to study the females' brood-rearing strategies. In this model a strategy consisted of combinations of staying at the nest, hunting, and deserting. The modeling assumptions were: a female's strategy during brood rearing maximizes her reproductive fitness, defined as the weighted average of the expected probability of survival of her current offspring and her expected future reproduction; and the reproductive fitness function depends on the physical condition of the female and nestlings, the risks to the nestlings associated with each strategy, and the male's foraging capabilities.
   The model predictions were compared to the observations of female strategies in this population of Cooper's Hawks. To insure a valid comparison, the model parameters were estimated from sources other than the observed population. The best match between observations and predictions (84-96%) was obtained when the nestlings' survival and the female's future reproductive potential were equally weighted during the nestling stage, but weighted in favor of the female's reproductive potential during the fledgling stage.
   A sensitivity analysis showed that the model predictions corresponded well with the observations of staying and hunting at all parameter bounds. However, those combinations of parameter values that reflected conditions with the least pressure to desert missed 70-85% of the desertions. The sensitivity analysis also indicated that a key factor influencing the female's choice of strategy was the interaction between the threat to her future reproduction due to her poor physical condition and the nestlings' risk of death from predation and exposure.
   The agreement of model predictions and observed strategies supported the modeling assumptions. These results combined with the sensitivity analysis indicated that dynamic state variable modeling is an excellent tool for studying mate desertion.

AB Analysis of several large collections of food webs has shown that predator-prey ratios tend to be roughly constant at values close to one. We suggest that the constancy of the ratio may simply be an arithmetical artifact, a consequence of the way the ratio is defined. Taxa can be recorded as both predator and prey and, hence, be double counted. In many webs the proportion of species that are double counted is large; consequently, the ratio of predator species to prey species will inevitably be roughly equal to one. We present a simple random food-web model in which predator-prey ratios are approximately constant with values close to one.

AB Epilithic bacteria appear to be an important trophic component in many stream ecosystems, but it is not clear whether bacterial abundance and growth covary with epilithic algae, one potential carbon source for bacteria. Epilithic bacterial abundances and growth rates were measured for 2 yr in two streams with contrasting trophic bases at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. The reference stream (Bear Brook) has a closed canopy, low epilithic primary production, and a high standing stock of detrital organic matter. A nearby stream in a clear-cut catchment had experienced algal blooms in the early years following cutting, and rates of primary production measured during our study period were 5 times greater than in Bear Brook.
   Chlorophyll a concentrations on tiles did not differ between streams, indicating that algal abundance was limited by factors other than light availability. Bacteria were not consistently correlated with algal abundances in either stream. Bacterial abundance and growth did not differ statistically between streams despite the large differences in rates of primary production.
   A shading experiment conducted in both streams was successful in reducing chlorophyll levels but did not reduce bacterial growth rates. A laboratory experiment involving nutrient additions and high light levels greatly stimulated algal abundance and carbon fixation, but there was no parallel increase in bacterial abundance or growth. Apparently, in contrast to planktonic systems, there is not a tight trophic connection between algal and bacterial productivity in these streams.

AB We have analyzed our own data set as well as a number of previously published ones to examine factors related to the numbers and biomass of sediment bacteria in a variety of ecosystems. We have chosen to express sediment variables either on an areal or per unit sediment volume basis to avoid bias due to the more common standardization to sediment dry mass (also known as gram dry weight). Cross-system comparisons show that the amount of organic matter present and the sediment water content are important to sediment bacterial abundance. The C:N ratio of the sediment organic matter, possibly reflecting organic matter quality, was found to explain variation in bacterial numbers in addition to that explained by organic content. Over a broad range, sediment water content is related to sediment bacterial numbers in a unimodal fashion indicating dilution of sediments by water at high (> 80%) water content sites and dilution by inorganic particles at low (< 50%) water content sites. In lakes, the most important factors explaining sediment bacterial biomass were sediment water content and hydraulic flushing rate, a finding supported by analysis of an independent data set of English lakes. Planktonic chlorophyll a and planktonic bacterial numbers (both reflecting autochthonous organic matter levels) were not significantly related to sediment bacterial biomass. We found that sediments overlain by epilimnetic water had significantly higher bacterial biomass than those overlain by hypolimnetic water. A strong positive relationship between macrobenthos and sediment bacterial biomass was found for lakes in Ontario and Quebec. Calculations of annual bacterial production and P:B ratios necessary to sustain the macrobenthic population, based on the observed bacterial and macrobenthic biomass and temperature at our sites, indicate that the bacterial biomass present is more than sufficient to maintain the macrobenthos. In addition, based on the observed ratios of bacterial to detrital carbon at our sites and on a range of published assimilation efficiencies for macrobenthos grazing on these carbon sources, we calculated that the mean percentage of carbon of bacterial origin assimilatable by macrobenthos at our sites is 53% with a maximum of 79% and a minimum of 12%. Our results suggest a tighter trophic linkage between sediment bacteria and macrobenthos in our lakes than in most marine habitats, as indicated by published studies. From these analyses, the general picture emerges of a decoupling between pelagic and benthic bacterial processes in lakes, the pelagic ones being driven mainly by autochthonous production and the benthic ones by allochthonous inputs.

AB Most plant-herbivore studies have demonstrated that young leaves are preferred over mature leaves, and that the majority of lifetime damage occurs during the 1 st mo. In spite of this, we know little about how young leaves are defended. Young leaves are an ephemeral resource, and herbivore damage may be reduced by (1) producing leaves at times of low herbivore abundance, (2) synchronous leaf production, or (3) rapid leaf expansion. To address these hypotheses I examined patterns of leaf phenology, leaf expansion, and herbivory in saplings of 32 species in a Panamanian lowland moist forest.
   Leaf phenology ranged from continuous to highly synchronous, and mean monthly damage rates varied from 6 to 60%. Within species, leaves produced during the dry season, a period of relatively low insect abundance, received less damage than leaves produced during the wet season. Leaves produced during synchronous flushes received less damage than leaves produced out of synchrony. Species with continuous or synchronous leaf production had lower damage rates than intermediate species, but growth rates and survivorship were not correlated with leaf production. It appears that higher damage rates in intermediate species may be compensated by reduced investment in chemical defenses compared with continuous species, and a less restricted growing season and reduced storage costs compared with synchronous species. Previous studies have identified leaf expansion rate as an important young leaf defense, but in this study there was no correlation between expansion rate and herbivory.

AB Body size differences typically influence sibling competition among nestling birds. In many species hatching order determines nestling size rank; however, sexually dimorphic growth may confound this correlation, giving one sex a consistent competitive advantage and leading to differential survival of the sexes. We found that captive female American Kestrel (Falco sparverius) nestlings were larger than male sibling nestmates from shortly after hatching through fledging. When food delivered by parents was small enough to be seized and swallowed immediately by a nestling, females showed clear competitive superiority over male sibling nestmates in scramble competition. Females also took larger portions than males of small, yet unmonopolizeable, items. Competitive ability and gender were unrelated when parents delivered large, unmonopolizeable prey. Choice experiments demonstrated that parent feeding preferences did not account for the females' advantage. Based on the above, we expected fledging sex ratio to become increasingly female biased as nestling mortality increased, because nestling mortality increases and prey size decreases when preferred prey (unmonopolizeable rodents) are not available. Data from a wild kestrel population in eastern Pennsylvania supported this prediction, showing a significant positive relationship between fledging brood size and representation of males in the brood, although we note an alternative explanation for this result. Female competitive dominance and its interaction with prey size may influence the evolution of sexual size dimorphism and primary sex ratio in this species and other raptors.

AB I manipulated relative body size of mussels (Mytilus californianus) and gull (Larus glaucescens) predation pressure within gaps in a mussel bed to determine (1) whether size differences could cause shifts in competitive dominance between goose barnacles (Pollicipes polymerus) and Mytilus, species with indeterminate growth, and (2) if the late-recruiting Mytilus required gull predation on established adult Pollicipes to attain dominance. Increasing relative body size enhanced the area and the rate of change in area covered by both Pollicipes and Mytilus. Preventing gull feeding enhanced Pollicipes and reduced Mytilus cover, slowing the rates of succession and reducing the frequency of disturbance. However, even in the absence of predators on Pollicipes and with an initial size disadvantage, Mytilus maintained positive rates of change in cover, probably because adult recruitment into the gap altered the initial size hierarchy of competitors. These results indicate that bird predation and initial size asymmetries can alter the dynamics, but not the eventual end point, of intertidal succession. They also highlight the importance of choosing the right comparison (differences between treatments vs. deviations in rates from 0) when testing alternative modes of succession (i.e., facilitation, tolerance, or inhibition). Although gull predation does not change the end point of succession locally, it may have important regional effects by altering the dynamics of disturbance and recovery. Such regional effects cannot be determined by experiments on a local scale.

AB Schistosomes are dioecious blood helminth parasites of mammals, including humans, and are responsible for schistosomiasis in tropical countries. The distribution patterns of worms among their host populations and the pairing probabilities of female schistosomes are of considerable importance in understanding transmission dynamics of this parasite. Data were obtained from field studies carried out over 8 yr on natural populations of Schistosoma mansoni, a human parasite but heavily infecting rats (Rattus rattus) in Guadeloupe. The distribution of male and female worms within the whole host population was fitted to a negative binomial, and the aggregation coefficient was estimated. The observed prevalence of male-female pairs, the observed prevalence of worms, and the observed pairing probability were calculated. Results demonstrate a strongly clumped worm distribution. Observed pairing probabilities of female worms in cases where male and female schistosomes are aggregated together within the host population are of the same order (phi(obs) ranging from 0.83 to 0.97) as the expected values obtained with the May (1977) model but significantly higher than in cases where the sexes are aggregated separately. A disequilibrated sex ratio biased towards male schistosomes increases the pairing probabilities of female worms.

AB Relationships between diatom assemblages and physicochemical factors were examined in 63 saline lakes in western North America. Sodium was the overwhelmingly dominant cation in the lakes examined; lakes above 47-degrees latitude were dominated by SO4-2, and lakes below 47-degrees were dominated by CO3-2 and Cl-1. This latitudinal gradient for anions was correlated with the distribution and community structure of diatoms. Sixty-two taxa comprised > 85% of the total diatom relative abundance in the saline environments. There were strong negative correlations between specific conductance and diversity and species richness, however pH and major cations showed limited predictive value. Cluster analyses identified diatom assemblages along specific conductance and major anion gradients. Indices for specific conductance and major anions were also developed for 62 diatom taxa. These diatom indices provide useful information to interpret past and present physicochemical conditions in lacustrine ecosystems. Greatest diversity was found in habitats with ionic concentrations < seawater and ion composition similar to marine environments. Principal components analyses comparing loadings for major cations and anions, ionic concentration, and diatom community structure suggested that shallow saline lakes may have provided evolutionary pathways for speciation of marine pennate diatoms into athalassic (nonmarine) environments.

AB We examined the role of growing season length in regulating percentage cover and seed mass of the alpine snow buttercup, Ranunculus adoneus, in a snowbed habitat. Season length varies from almost-equal-to 50 d in early-melting portions of the snowbed to 35 d in late-melting locations. Percentage cover and seed mass of snow buttercups decrease from early- to late-melting locations. Time available for growth was manipulated experimentally by altering the snowmelt schedule. Advancing snowmelt by 14 d in typically late-melting portions of the snowbed led to a threefold increase in percentage cover of snow buttercups (P < .025). However, delaying snowmelt to the same extent in typically early-melting locations had little influence on snow buttercups. These results indicate that time available for growth limits cover of snow buttercups in late-emerging vegetation, whereas other factors regulate cover of snow buttercups in early-emerging vegetation. Perturbation of snowmelt schedule also had significant effects on seed mass (P < .0055). These effects are probably mediated through changes in time available for seed maturation. Snow manipulation treatment accounted for 71% of the variation in seed maturation interval. Maturation interval, in turn, was correlated with seed mass (P < .01). Reducing or increasing the seed maturation interval by 12 d caused a 33% change in seed mass. These findings show strong direct effects of growing season length on plant performance at diverse life history stages.

AB We examined the expression of metamorphic and paedomorphic phenotypes of the salamander Ambystoma talpoideum in relation to a fish predator. We measured the effects of fish density and time of introduction on larval activity, growth, survival, and body size, and the percentage of larvae metamorphosing or becoming paedomorphic, i.e., maturing as larvae. In addition, a laboratory experiment measured refuge use by larvae according to varying amounts of chemical cues from fish. There was no effect of fish density or time of introduction on survival and growth rate of larvae, nor on final density of zooplankton. Percentage of individuals becoming paedomorphic or metamorphosing was positively related to mean body size in ponds. An analysis of covariance, after removing the effect of body size, revealed a significant effect of fish density on the expression of the paedomorphic phenotype, but not on that of metamorphosis. The proportional decline of paedomorphs was related to the increase of larvae. The laboratory experiment indicated that refuge use by larvae was proportional to the amount of fish stimuli. Activity of larvae in the ponds, however, was not affected by fish density, but rather showed that larvae became habituated to fish. Our experiment demonstrated that expression of the paedomorphic phenotype is reduced in the presence of fish, not by increasing the number of metamorphs as expected, but by increasing the number of individuals that remained as larvae. These results indicate that models of amphibian metamorphosis based on growth and mortality are not adequate to explain paedomorphosis. We propose that trade-offs with reproductive traits such as size and age at first reproduction must be incorporated into models predicting metamorphosis as an alternative life history pathway to paedomorphosis.

AB Within-plant variation in food nutritional quality is a fundamental feature in the foraging environment of herbivores, but little is known as to how such small-scale variability affects individuals or structures populations of herbivores. The selective pressure favoring choosy herbivores may depend on the relative performance of random foragers, which will experience chronic changes in food quality, vs. non-random foragers. To determine the effect of involuntary variation in nitrogen intake on larvae of a polyphagous insect, gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar (L.)), I reared individuals on one of three diet treatments:  (1) Constant nitrogen: larvae received 3.0% N diet continuously; (2) Low variance:  larvae were switched each day in an alternating sequence of 2.25% and 3.75% N diet; and (3) High variance: as in Low variance, except larvae were alternated between 1.25% and 4.75% N diet.
   Despite equal relative consumption rates (RCR) and nitrogen consumption rates (RNCR) across all treatments, larvae experiencing variation in the diet suffered reduced pupal mass and extended development time. Evidently growth performance cannot be predicted based solely on mean diet nitrogen concentration, which was equal among all treatments (3.0% N). Further, growth on a mixture of foods cannot be predicted based on known responses to the individual foods. Reduced growth associated with the chronic variation likely was caused, in part, by nonlinearity in the relationship between nitrogen and food utilization efficiency, and by disruption of the compensatory feeding response. These results suggest that intraplant variation in food quality has the potential to exert strong selective pressure for regulation of variation in the total diet.

AB We examined in the laboratory and field the foraging behavior of the stenophagous egg parasitoid Anagrus delicatus (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) within discrete patches of its planthopper host, Prokelisia marginata (Homoptera: Delphacidae) on leaves of salt marsh cord grass, Spartina alterniflora. Females efficiently discriminated between leaves with and without hosts, leaving empty leaves within 6 min, on average. On leaves with hosts, wasps remained almost-equal-to 10 times as long (XBAR +/- 1 SE = 62 +/- 8 min); time on a patch was independent of host density. In the laboratory, newly mated female A. delicatus encountering hosts for the first time and bearing an average of 33 yolked and mature eggs, parasitized an average of 6 hosts (laying 18% of her eggs) before dispersing from patches containing an average of 81 hosts. Many more hosts were probed than were parasitized. In field experiments with mixtures of newly mated and experienced females, the proportion of eggs laid by these wasps was even lower; between 4% and 26% were laid in a series of experiments that spanned 20 dates over 10 mo. In all tests, available hosts far exceeded wasp fecundity.
   Most, if not all hosts, were alive, available, and supported development of parasitoids if parasitized. Increasing numbers of female wasps visiting a patch led to increasing parasitism rate, to an average of 75% with 20 female wasps. Even though many hosts on a patch were probed and rejected by each wasp, rejected hosts were parasitized by subsequent wasps and yielded live parasitoid offspring; rejected hosts were not unsuitable hosts. Leaf thickness provided no refuge from parasitism by A. delicatus. Hosts laid deep within plant leaves (X = 118 mum) were no less vulnerable to attack than those laid shallow, and all hosts were well within the range of the long ovipositor of A. delicatus (XBAR = 394 mum).
   Single wasps dispersed before the ratio of unparasitized to parasitized hosts was much decreased by their efforts; dispersal was not precipitated by high encounters with parasitized hosts. Handing time constraints were small (XBAR = 2.2 min) in relation to total patch time (XBAR = 62 min), and thus did not account for the low number of ovipositions. Interference among searching parasitoids was not responsible for the underutilization of hosts in the field because single wasps, searching alone in new patches not previously visited by A. delicatus, displayed the same characteristically low attack rates as wasps searching together with others.
   Classical arguments of parasitoid foraging, which assume maximization of oviposition rate with respect to time, are inconsistent with the substantially submaximal oviposition rates for this parasitoid. Anagrus delicatus passed up many suitable and available hosts in each patch and visited multiple patches during its lifetime; number of eggs laid increased linearly with the number of patches visited. Wasps visiting greater-than-or-equal-to 5 patches laid an average of 32 eggs (95% of average egg complement). Our hypothesis is that this is a foraging strategy build upon compromising the time rate of oviposition in favor of spreading ovipositions among patches and sites. We observed high mortality of host-plant leaves, and thus of host-insect patches, in the field due to leaf senescence (20-30%), which would favor spreading of parasitoid offspring among leaves.

AB A study of one of the simplest systems incorporating both dispersal and local dynamics, coupling two discrete time logistic equations, demonstrates several surprising features. Passive dispersal can cause chaotic dynamics to be replaced by simple periodic dynamics. Thus passive movement can be stabilizing, even in a deterministic model without underlying spatial variation in the dynamics. The boundary between initial conditions leading to qualitatively different dynamics can be a fractal, so it is essentially impossible to specify the asymptotic behavior in terms of the initial conditions. In accord with several recent studies of arthropods and earlier theoretical work, density dependence may only be detectable at a small enough spatial scale, so efforts to uncover density dependence must include investigations of movement.

AB We investigated the roles of bet hedging and developmental plasticity in the diapause strategy of a partially bivoltine population of the cricket Allonemobius fasciatus. When reared under naturally changing environmental conditions, first-generation females produced increasing proportions of diapause eggs over their reproductive life-span, presumably reflecting the decreasing probability over time that sufficient growing season remains for a second generation. The transition from direct-developing to diapause eggs occurred over 35 d for the population, suggesting a considerable degree of bet hedging. The analysis of individuals, however, revealed a much more rapid response and large between-female variability in the median (50%) diapause date. This rapid transition from nondiapause to diapause eggs implies that interannual variability in season length has not resulted in the evolution of a substantial risk-spreading strategy for individual females. Our results highlight the need to study life history variation at the level of the individual rather than the population.

AB We tested several predictions concerning fungal rot and antifungal defense of vertebrate-dispersed fruit. (1) Fungal fruit rot should be generally deterrent to frugivores. But because fungi may vary in their negative effects, antifungal defenses should be allocated in relationship to net effects of particular species on dispersal. (2) Defenses of fruits under selection for high palatability should be directed primarily toward microbes (''microbe-specific'' defenses). Lower quality fruits, for which high palatability is not crucial to dispersal, may be defended by more general defenses. (3) Preferred fruits should be defended to a lower degree than less preferred fruits, as a result of consistently high dispersal rates (Removal Rate model).
   We tested our hypotheses using real fruits and artificial-pulp media of six temperate ericaceous plants in feeding trials with captive birds and in fungal growth trials. Plants had been assigned to two temperate fruiting classes (Summer Small-seeded, SS, or Fall Low-quality, FL), and differed in ripening phenology, persistence times, and fungal resistance in the field. We compared feeding rates on fruits rotted by members of a suite of fruit rot fungi. We also determined feeding rates on artificial-pulp media that either contained ripe fruit extracts or did not, and we determined fungal growth rates on identical media. We found that: (1) fungal species depressed feeding rates in general accordance with their reported vertebrate toxicity. Relative to nontoxic fungi, toxic fungi were inhibited more strongly by secondary fruit pulp extracts. (2) Artificial-pulp media of SS fruits were preferred in feeding trials, due both to basic nutritional composition and nondeterrent (microbe-specific) secondary defense. (3) In accordance with the Removal-Rate model, artificial-pulp media of the preferred SS fruits showed significant antifungal activity, but at a much lower level than that of FL fruits. Our results suggest that a primary function of secondary chemicals in ripe fruits may be to defend against destructive fungi that compete with seed dispersers for the pulp. Our results generally support the hypothesis that selective pressures may result in ripe fruit defenses that are directed primarily against organisms having strong negative effects upon dispersal. As such, factors influencing risk of pulp consumption by nondispersers may be useful predictors of fruit defense patterns.

AB The conventional ecological approach to predation provides a limited framework for understanding perceptual and tactical mechanisms of search and detection and their dynamical consequences. In contrast, models developed to guide naval search operations are ''spatiotemporal dynamic interaction models,'' analogous to those developed in plant population ecology. Our application of these models to foraging sparrows indicates that perceptual and tactical constraints play a critical role in the allocation of search effort across habitat patches, in the choice of tactics within patches, and in the predation dynamics that emerge over time. Sparrows search where prey are most detectable rather than where they are most abundant, and they tune search tactics to perceptual operating conditions. The approach describes and predicts details of search and detection, cumulative harvest rates, and selectivities more accurately than the conventional search-efficiency approach.

AB I examined habitat use efficiencies of two morphologically distinct three spine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus spp.). The species make up one of several coexisting pairs that apparently formed in the past 13 000 yr in coastal British Columbia lakes. Previous comparative work has shown that morphology and habitat use are correlated within and among populations. Sticklebacks occurring alone in lakes are intermediate in morphology and habitat use, suggesting that differences between the sympatric species result from ecological character displacement.
   I tested two hypotheses to explain these patterns, and which are implicit in general views of the causes of adaptive radiation: (1) Each resource (habitat) subjects its species to unique selection pressures, owing to the advantages of certain combinations of traits for foraging; (2) Phenotypes intermediate between habitat specialists suffer a competitive disadvantage. These hypotheses were evaluated by measuring the foraging rates of the two species and their interspecific hybrids in the two main habitats (benthos and open water) provided in the laboratory.
   Efficiencies of habitat exploitation matched observed morphological differences. In the benthic habitat the larger, deeper bodies species (having also a wide mouth and few short gill rakers) was superior to the smaller, more slender species (having a narrow mouth and many long gill rakers). Success of hybrids was intermediate. This rank order of species efficiencies was reversed in the open water habitat. These results support the hypothesis that different traits are favored in different habitats, and that adaptation to one habitat has occurred at the expense of feeding rate in the other. Average foraging success of hybrids in the two habitats fell near or below the average of the two parental species, suggesting natural selection against intermediate phenotypes. Foraging efficiency in open water was greatest in the smaller size classes of fish, hinting that small size of the open water species is the result of selection for high foraging efficiency. However, size could not explain most differences in feeding efficiency between species, and it is likely that many traits contribute.

AB The relative impacts of nutrient availability, disturbance intensity, and interspecific competition on species distribution and growth were studied by applying five levels of nutrients and five intensities of clipping to simple artificial communities (of Dactylis glomerata, Holcus lanatus, Lolium perenne, and Trifolium repens) in a factorial design for 16 mo. This was done to test the hypothesis that the effects of interspecific competition would decline along gradients as the amount of nutrients decreased and the degree of disturbance increased. Nutrients and disturbance, alone and in interaction, produced significant effects on percent cover of all species, and all species achieved maximum percent cover in the undisturbed regime. The experimental design permitted us to distinguish between percent cover reductions caused directly by nutrients and disturbance from those caused by interspecific competition. When grown in mixture, interspecific competition produced marked changes in the distribution patterns of percent cover that were in addition to the direct impacts of nutrients and disturbance. The absolute reduction in percent cover due to interspecific competition was greatest in the undisturbed regime, and for many mixtures this competitive effect was significantly reduced or even eliminated in the highly disturbed areas. Along the nutrient gradient the responses were variable and neighbor dependent, but for all species, the absolute reduction in percent cover due to interspecific competition was generally most severe where percent cover in pure stands was highest.
   When the data were standardized for differences in percent cover in pure stands and competition was assessed as the percent reduction in percent cover between pure and mixed stands, then the effect of interspecific competition on Trifolium declined along both gradients. The three grasses had a reasonably constant competitive effect across the disturbance gradient, but along the nutrient gradient the highest competitive effects were generally achieved where percent cover in pure stands was highest. We argue that this standardized index is less appropriate because it obscures the obvious differences in interspecific competition effects that are clearly operating within these communities.

AB The distance that pollen is dispersed has important ecological and evolutionary implications. Nevertheless, our understanding of the mechanism that generates spatial patterns of pollen dispersal in animal-pollinated plants, namely the combined processes of pollinator movement and pollen deposition, is at present qualitative. I show how easily measured characteristics of pollinator movement and pollen deposition can be used to build models that generate quantitative predictions about pollen dispersal distance. A field experiment in which I followed honey bees (Apis mellifera) foraging on one-dimensional arrays of mustard plants (Brassica campestris) indicated that individual honeybees have a biased direction of movement and alter their movement patterns in response to plant spacing. I used the model to explore the potential consequences of biased movement and plant spacing for pollen dispersal. Biased movement results in an increase in the expected pollen dispersal distance. In addition, the predicted dispersal distance increased with increasing interplant distance. These results demonstrate that models of pollen spatial dynamics based on individual pollinator behavior can be used to explore the consequences of plant spatial arrangement for gene flow in plant populations.

AB We conducted an 8-yr study of flower and acorn production in three species of oak in east-central Missouri: white oak (Quercus alba), red oak (Q. rubra), and black oak (Q. velutina). The goal was to evaluate whether mast-fruiting, the synchronous production of large seed crops followed by small seed crops, is simply a response to weather conditions or is actually an evolved reproductive strategy. In this paper, we address four specific questions: (1) Are annual fluctuations in acorn crop size the result of synchronous production of acorns by individuals? (2) Are large acorn crops the result of large flower crops and/or high survival of those flowers to mature fruit? (3) To what extent do weather variables account for variation in acorn production among years? (4) Does acorn crop size correlate negatively with prior acorn production?
   Red oak and white oak showed a greater degree of mast-fruiting than did black oak. Within a species, individuals tended to produce large acorn crops in the same years, but each species differed in which years they produced large crops. The size of a given acorn crop was determined by both flower abundance and survival of flowers to fruit. Principal components and multiple-regression analyses were used to describe the relationship between weather variables and acorn production. The first principal component explained the largest amount of the variation in black oak (R2 = 0.55) and red oak (R2 = 0.89). In white oak, two principal components combined to explain 77% of the variation in acorn production. The weather variables that were associated with these principal components included spring temperature (positive effect) and summer drought (negative effect).
   Past acorn production had a major impact on the size of the current acorn crop, with each species showing a different pattern. In black oak, the current acorn crop was negatively correlated with the crop 3 yr prior but positively correlated with the crop 2 yr prior. In red oak, acorn crop size 1, 2, and 3 yr prior had negative correlations with current acorn crop, while acorn crop size 4 yr prior was positively correlated. In white oak, there were negative correlations between acorn crop size and crop size 1, 2, and 4 yr prior but a positive correlation with the acorn crop size 3 yr prior. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that mast-fruiting species must store resources during some years in order to produce a mast crop. We discuss the possibility that these three species may have inherent cycles of reproduction that are modified by the impact of weather conditions, black oak with 2-yr cycles, white oak with 3-yr cycles, and red oak with 4-yr cycles. We conclude that the patterns of acorn production for black oak, red oak, and white oak are not simply responses to weather events but are also a function of prior reproductive events. This suggests that masting is an evolved reproductive strategy.

AB The role of plant chemistry in determining the suitability of herbivore-free individuals within a plant population has rarely been investigated. In this study, we examined the importance of furanocoumarin chemistry in determining distribution patterns of the parsnip webworm (Depressaria pastinacella) in a population of its host plant, wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa). Parsnip webworms feed almost exclusively on wild parsnip, a species that produces furanocoumarins, compounds that are toxic or deterrent to many insects. Samples of plants hosting actively feeding parsnip webworms (attacked) and plants exhibiting no damage (unattacked) were collected in the field and brought to the laboratory, where they were examined for content of three furanocoumarins, xanthotoxin, bergapten, and sphondin. In addition, they were bioassayed with ultimate-instar parsnip webworms; growth, consumption rate, and rate of in vitro metabolism of furanocoumarins were compared between larvae fed undamaged tissue from attacked plants and larvae fed tissue from unattacked plants. Attacked plants contained less than half the amount of xanthotoxin and sphondin, two of the three furanocoumarins assayed, than did unattacked plants. Growth and consumption rates of larvae fed tissue of unattacked plants also were reduced significantly (40 and 24%, respectively) compared to larvae fed attacked plants. Moreover, in vitro metabolism of xanthotoxin and bergapten was reduced by 50% in larvae fed tissue from unattacked plants compared to larvae fed tissues of attacked plants. Cluster analysis placed plants into three groups based on furanocoumarin chemistry. One group, characterized by high concentrations of all three furanocoumarins, contained only unattacked individuals. A second group consisting of plants intermediate in furanocoumarin concentration, contained predominantly unattacked individuals, and the last group, characterized by low concentrations of all three furanocoumarins, was dominated by attacked individuals. When larvae are fed plant tissues with below-average total furanocoumarin concentrations, consumption rate is the most important larval characteristic determining growth rate. However, when larvae are fed plant tissues with above-average concentrations of furanocoumarins, the capacity to metabolize furanocoumarins is also important. These results indicate that plant chemistry, relative to larval ability to tolerate plant chemicals, can to a large extent explain the distribution of this insect within a population of its host plant.

AB Some bog lakes in northern Wisconsin and Michigan lack fish because of low pH and low winter oxygen concentrations. The lakes are characterized by a dominance of large zooplankton species. Small zooplankton species are scarce, whereas in nearby lakes with fish they are common. The importance of biotic and abiotic factors in preventing the successful invasion of small zooplankton species into these fishless lakes was determined using a series of field manipulations. The relative importance of competition with large herbivores (the cladoceran Daphnia pulex), predation by large invertebrates (the dipteran Chaoborus americanus and the copepod Diaptomus leptopus), and abiotic conditions including pH were examined experimentally. Abiotic and/or resource conditions suppressed the population growth rate of 70% of the small zooplankton species introduced into enclosures in the fishless lakes relative to those introduced into enclosures in their resident lake (a lake with fish). Fewer small zooplankton species were suppressed in a similar experiment when pH was experimentally raised to 7, suggesting that pH is one factor that inhibits the successful invasion of small zooplankton into these lakes. Manipulations of large herbivores and invertebrate predators showed that predation was more important than competition in restricting the distribution of small species. Predation by Chaoborus primarily reduced the densities of crustaceans while predation by Diaptomus reduced the densities of rotifers. Competitive suppression of small zooplankton by Daphnia was not detected. The results suggest that both predation by Chaoborus and Diaptomus and abiotic conditions, including pH, are important factors determining zooplankton community structure in these fishless bog lakes.

AB Fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) and brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans) are often sympatric, occupy similar microhabitats, and share common predators. Therefore, individuals that detect alarm signals of both conspecifics and heterospecifics should gain antipredator benefits. We conducted a series of experiments to determine the extent to which these species respond to chemical alarm signals from conspecifics and heterospecifics. In laboratory experiments, brook stickleback responded to chemical stimuli from injured conspecifics with increased shoaling, but did not increase shoaling following exposure to chemical stimuli from injured swordtails (Xiphophorus helleri), an unfamiliar tropical fish that is not closely related to either stickleback or fathead minnows. These data are the first to document a chemical alarm signal for fishes in the order Gasterosteiformes. Brook stickleback also exhibited fright responses to extracts from injured fathead minnows in both laboratory and field tests. Stickleback did not exhibit a fright reaction following exposure to chemical stimuli from fathead minnows that had been treated with testosterone to decrease the concentration of alarm substance cells. This result suggests that the minnow alarm pheromone is the active component rather than some other constituent of the minnow skin extracts. In contrast to the response of the stickleback, fathead minnows did not respond to extracts from brook stickleback with a fright response. These data suggest that brook stickleback may benefit from close proximity with fathead minnows by gaining early warning of danger.

A single clone of D. magna isolated from a shallow lake with planktivorous fish is able to express the full range of SFR observed in the field (1.8-3.0 mm) when raised under controlled temperature and food conditions in the laboratory. Control of SFR is predominantly based on size differences in the eggs of the first and the following broods of Daphnia. First-brood eggs are smaller. They hatch into smaller neonates that mature at a smaller size. In the lake, fish may selectively remove large females, and this will increase the share of first-brood females in the population. Offspring of these females will mature at a much smaller size, so that the size response to predation is intensified. When predation ceases, some females can grow to larger sizes. They will contribute many large offspring to the population because the they have larger clutch sizes and larger eggs. This leads to a rapid shift toward large SFR.
   A single clone of D. magna was hatched from isolated eggs to measure the components of maternal size dependency, which is basic to this hypothesis. Strong positive relationships were found between female size and egg size, egg size and neonate size, neonate size and SFR, size of a female and its offspring's SFR, and female size and clutch size. The predicted pattem of SFR in relation to average body size is found in the lake, but the pattem of egg size is not clear, as egg size is strongly affected by changes in food abundance.
   This mechanism of phenotypic response may be a fortuitous effect of selection for maximum egg numbers in the first brood, but the increase of offspring size with maternal size may also be adaptive itself.

AB An assumption of most optimal diet theory is that different resources are substitutable, that is, that they are identical in all relevant aspects and so can be ranked in value using a single currency, such as energy. However, this assumption is probably not valid in many cases. The sea hare Dolabella auricularia (Gastropoda: Opisthobranchia: Anaspidea) grew far better upon an ad libitum mixture of four species of algae than upon any of the algal species alone, suggesting that algae were complementary resources. When offered three pairs of algae in 4:1 and 1:9 ratios, Dolabella changed its foraging behavior so that the rarer alp was preferred. Consequently, the mixtures of algae consumed were more similar between treatments (ratios) than the mixtures of algae offered. Replicate Dolabella were maintained on six single algal diets for 6-7 d and then offered the maintenance alga and another alga at equal abundances. Preference for a species of algae was always higher when it was not the maintenance diet compared to when it was. These results suggest that Dolabella actively maintains a mixed diet because it is nutritionally superior to any single diet. An alternative hypothesis (the nonadditive toxin hypothesis) suggests that herbivores might consume a mixed diet because a mixture of plant secondary metabolites is less toxic than any one metabolite alone; consequently, herbivores can consume more total biomass of a mixed than of a single diet. However, sea hares fed single- and mixed-species diets did not consume more of mixed diets than of single-species diets, and animals fed a mixed diet grew better than those fed single diets even when the biomass of algae offered was held constant. If resources are complementary, as suggested here, several important implications follow: (1) consumers will not rank resources in any absolute way because the value of each will depend upon what else is consumed, (2) consumer specialization will be opposed by the benefits of a mixed diet, and (3) consumer foraging will tend to destabilize the resource community, because rarer resources will be disproportionately consumed.

AB We investigated the herbivory tolerance characteristics of shrubs in a comparative study of two Great Basin shrub species with different abilities to tolerate browsing. Simulated winter browsing treatments were applied to the less tolerant species, mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana (Rydb.) Beetle), and to the more tolerant species, bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata (Pursh) D.C.), growing in natural stands. These treatments ranged in severity from terminal bud removal to removal of 100% of current annual growth, and were applied to (1) individual branches on shrubs and (2) to entire shrubs. We measured growth responses on entire treated branches or on typical branches when treatment was to the entire shrub. We recorded the fate (long shoot, short shoot, mortality, and in Artemisia only, flowering stem) of all nodes on each measured branch and the length, node production, and estimated biomass of all new long shoots. We also estimated the proportion of resources removed by each simulated browsing treatment.
   Purshia compensated for the loss of tissue to a greater extent than Artemisia. In comparison to unclipped branches, Artemisia and Purshia both increased the frequency of new long shoots produced in response to simulated browsing. However, Artemisia tended toward reduced long shoot biomass with increased browsing, while Purshia was either insensitive to the severity of browsing treatment or, in one case, increased long shoot biomass after treatment. The contrasting responses were particularly evident in the most severe treatment, which resulted in death of all Artemisia branches but in biomass production equal to controls in Purshia. Additionally, node production declined in Artemisia but in Purshia was equal to or exceeded node production in control unclipped branches. In this study, neither aboveground resource availability nor bud availability fully explained differences in the abilities of Artemisia and Purshia to tolerate browsing. In addition, the results from this and related studies suggest that inherent relative growth rate was not correlated with herbivory tolerance in these species. Developmental plasticity and the resultant altered resource allocation patterns following winter browsing appear to distinguish Artemisia and Purshia in their ability to tolerate browsing.
